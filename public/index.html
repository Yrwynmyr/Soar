<headtitle>The history of Judaism</headtitle>


-<p>
It is history that provides the key to an understanding of Judaism, for its primal affirmations appear in early historical narratives. Thus, the 
<xref topicid="64396" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624534">Bible</xref>
reports contemporary events and activities for essentially religious reasons. The biblical authors believed that the divine presence is encountered primarily within history. God’s presence is also experienced within the natural realm, but the more immediate or intimate disclosure occurs in human actions. Although other ancient communities also perceived a divine presence in history, the understanding of the ancient 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israelites</xref>
proved to be the most lasting and influential. It is this particular claim—to have experienced God’s presence in human events—and its subsequent development that is the differentiating factor in Jewish thought. 
</p>


-<p>
Moreover, the ancient Israelites’ entire mode of existence was affected by their belief that throughout history they stood in a unique relationship with the divine. The people of 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israel</xref>
believed that their response to the divine presence in history was central not only for themselves but for all humankind. Furthermore, God—as person—had revealed in a particular encounter the pattern and structure of communal and individual life to this people. Claiming sovereignty over the people because of his continuing action in history on their behalf, he had established a 
<xref topicid="141085" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">covenant</xref>
(
<e>berit</e>
) with them and required from them obedience to his teaching, or law (
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624535">Torah</xref>
). This obedience was a further means by which the divine presence was made manifest—expressed in concrete human existence. The corporate life of the 
<xref topicid="114629" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chosen</xref>
community was thus a summons to the rest of humankind to recognize God’s presence, sovereignty, and purpose—the establishment of peace and well-being in the universe and in humankind. 
</p>

<p>History, moreover, disclosed not only God’s purpose but also humankind’s inability to live in accord with it. Even the chosen community failed in its obligation and had to be summoned back, time and again, to its responsibility by the prophets—the divinely called spokespersons who warned of retribution within history and argued and reargued the case for affirmative human response. Israel’s role in the divine economy and thus Israel’s particular culpability were dominant themes sounded against the motif of fulfillment, the ultimate triumph of the divine purpose, and the establishment of divine sovereignty over all humankind.</p>

<headtitle>General observations</headtitle>


-<h3 tocid="35166">

<headtitle>Nature and characteristics</headtitle>


-<p>
In nearly 4,000 years of historical development, the Jewish people and their religion have displayed a remarkable adaptability and continuity. In their encounter with the great civilizations, from ancient 
<xref topicid="47586" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonia</xref>
and Egypt to Western Christendom and modern secular culture, they have assimilated foreign elements and integrated them into their own social and religious systems, thus maintaining an unbroken religious and cultural tradition. Furthermore, each period of Jewish history has left behind it a specific element of a Judaic heritage that continued to influence subsequent developments, so that the total Jewish heritage at any given time is a combination of all these successive elements along with whatever adjustments and accretions have occurred in each new age. 
</p>


-<p>
The various teachings of Judaism have often been regarded as specifications of the central idea of 
<xref topicid="390101" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624537">monotheism</xref>
. One God, the creator of the world, has freely elected the Jewish people for a unique covenantal relationship with himself. This one and only God has been affirmed by virtually all professing Jews in a variety of ways throughout the ages. 
</p>


-<p>
Jewish 
<xref topicid="390101" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">monotheism</xref>
has had both universalistic and particularistic features. Along universal lines, it has affirmed a God who created and rules the entire world and who at the end of history will redeem all Israel (the classical name for the Jewish people), all humankind, and indeed the whole world. The ultimate goal of all nature and history is an unending reign of cosmic intimacy with God, entailing universal justice and peace. Between creation and redemption lies the particularistic designation of the Jewish people as the locus of God’s activity in the world, as the people chosen by God to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6). This arrangement is designated a covenant and is structured by an elaborate and intricate law. Thus, the Jewish people are both entitled to special privileges and burdened with special responsibilities from God. As the prophet 
<xref topicid="21356" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624538">Amos</xref>
(8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) expressed it: “You alone have I intimately known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities” (Amos 3:2). The universal goal of the Jewish people has frequently expressed itself in 
<xref topicid="377146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597900">messianism</xref>
—the idea of a universal, political realm of justice and peace. In one form or another, messianism has permeated Jewish thinking and action throughout the ages, and it has strongly influenced the outlook of many secular-minded Jews (
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="192308" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597899">eschatology</xref>
). 
</p>


-<p>
Law embraces practically all domains of Jewish life, and it became the principle means by which Judaism was to bring about the reign of God on earth. It is a total guide to religious and ethical conduct, involving ritualistic observance as well as individual and social 
<xref topicid="194023" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ethics</xref>
. It is a liturgical and ethical way constantly expatiated on by the prophets and priests, by rabbinic sages, and by philosophers. Such conduct was to be performed in the service of God, the transcendent and immanent ruler of the universe, the Creator and the propelling force of nature, and the one giving guidance and purpose to history. According to Judaic belief, this divine guidance is manifested through the history of the Jewish people, which will culminate in the messianic age. Judaism, whether in its “normative” form or in its sectarian deviations, never completely departed from this basic ethical and historical monotheism.

<headtitle>Periodization</headtitle>


-<p>
The division of the millennia of Jewish history into periods is a procedure frequently dependent on 
<xref topicid="267522" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">philosophical</xref>
predilections. The Christian world long believed that until the rise of 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597901">Christianity</xref>
the history of Judaism was but a “preparation for the Gospel” (
<e>preparatio evangelica</e>
) that was followed by the “manifestation of the Gospel” (
<e>demonstratio evangelica</e>
) as revealed by Christ and the Apostles. This formulation could be theologically reconciled with the assumption that 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christianity</xref>
had been preordained even before the creation of the world. 
</p>


-<p>
In the 19th century, biblical scholars moved the decisive division back to the period of the 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597902">Babylonian Exile</xref>
and the restoration of the Jews to the kingdom of 
<xref topicid="307146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624539">Judah</xref>
(6th–5th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). They asserted that after the first fall of 
<xref topicid="302812" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jerusalem</xref>
(586 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) the ancient “Israelitic” religion gave way to a new form of the “Jewish” 
<xref topicid="200515" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">faith</xref>
, or Judaism, as formulated by the reformer 
<xref topicid="199520" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597903">Ezra</xref>
(5th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) and his school. In 
<e>Die Entstehung des Judentums</e>
(1896; “The Origin of Judaism”) the German historian Eduard Meyer argued that Judaism originated in the Persian period, or the days of 
<xref topicid="199520" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezra</xref>
and 
<xref topicid="408221" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624541">Nehemiah</xref>
(5th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
); indeed, he attributed an important role in shaping the emergent religion to Persian imperialism. 
</p>


-<p>
These theories, however, have been discarded by most scholars in the light of a more comprehensive knowledge of the 
<xref topicid="381267" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ancient Middle East</xref>
and the abandonment of a theory of gradual evolutionary development that was dominant at the beginning of the 20th century. Most Jews share a long-accepted notion that there never was a real break in continuity and that Mosaic-prophetic-priestly Judaism was continued, with only a few modifications, in the work of the Pharisaic and rabbinic sages well into the modern period. Even today the various Jewish groups—whether 
<xref topicid="433416" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624542">Orthodox</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="133461" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624543">Conservative</xref>
, or 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624544">Reform</xref>
—all claim direct spiritual descent from the Pharisees and the rabbinic sages. In fact, however, many developments have occurred within so-called normative or 
<xref topicid="487890" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624545">Rabbinic Judaism</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
In any event, the history of Judaism can be divided into the following major periods: biblical Judaism (
<e>c.</e>
20th–4th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), Hellenistic Judaism (4th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–2nd century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), 
<xref topicid="487890" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rabbinic Judaism</xref>
(2nd–18th century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), and modern Judaism (
<e>c.</e>
1750 to the present).

(all early 2nd millennium

, which then belonged to the Hurrian kingdom of 
<xref topicid="385882" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597905">Mitanni</xref>
. From there 
<xref topicid="1544" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Abraham</xref>
, the founder of the Hebrew people, is said to have migrated to 
<xref topicid="91488" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624934">Canaan</xref>
(comprising roughly the region of modern Israel and Lebanon), which was a vortex of west Asian, Egyptian, and east Mediterranean cultures throughout the biblical period and later ages. From 
<xref topicid="91488" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Canaan</xref>
the Hebrew ancestors of the people of Israel (named after the patriarch 
<xref topicid="298924" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jacob</xref>
, also called Israel) migrated to Egypt, where they lived in servitude; a few generations later they returned to occupy part of Canaan. 
</p>


-<p>

<xref topicid="296891" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israelite</xref>
culture initially resembled that of its surroundings; it was neither wholly original nor wholly primitive. The Hebrews were seminomadic herdsmen and occasionally farmers. Their tribal structure resembled that of the West Semitic steppe dwellers known from the 18th-century-
<e ty="s">bce</e>
tablets excavated at the north-central Mesopotamian city of 
<xref topicid="364795" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mari</xref>
; their family customs and law have parallels in the Old Babylonian and Hurro-Semite law of the early and middle 2nd millennium. The conception of a messenger of God that underlies biblical prophecy was 
<xref topicid="21276" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624981">Amorite</xref>
(West Semitic) and also found in the tablets at Mari. Mesopotamian religious and cultural conceptions are reflected in biblical cosmogony, primeval history (including the Flood story in Genesis 6:9–8:22), and law collections. The Canaanite component of Israelite culture consisted of the 
<xref topicid="259061" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634706">Hebrew language</xref>
and a rich literary heritage—whose Ugaritic form (which flourished in the northern Syrian city of 
<xref topicid="612669" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624935">Ugarit</xref>
from the mid-15th century to approximately 1200 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) illuminates the Bible’s poetry, style, mythological allusions, and religious or cultic terms. Egypt provides many analogues for Hebrew hymnody and wisdom literature. All the cultures among which the patriarchs lived had cosmic gods who fashioned the world and preserved its order, all had a developed ethical system expressed in law and moral admonitions, and all had elaborate religious rites and myths. 
</p>


-<p>
Although plainer when compared with some of the learned literary creations of Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Egypt, the earliest biblical writings are so imbued with contemporary ancient Middle Eastern elements that the once-held assumption that Israelite religion began on a preliterate level must be rejected. Late-born amid high civilizations, the Israelite religion had from the start features characteristic of all the known religions of the area. Implanted on the 
<xref topicid="329118" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">land bridge</xref>
between Africa and Asia, it was exposed to crosscurrents of foreign thought throughout its history.

Israelite tradition identified YHWH (by scholarly convention pronounced 
<xref topicid="651183" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597917">Yahweh</xref>
), the God of Israel, with the creator of the world, who had been known and worshipped from the beginning of time. Abraham did not discover this God but entered into a new covenantal relationship with him, in which Abraham was promised the land of Canaan and numerous progeny. God fulfilled that promise, it is believed, through the actions of the Hebrew leader 
<xref topicid="393555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597914">Moses</xref>
(14th–13th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
): he liberated the people of Israel from Egypt, imposed covenantal obligations on them at 
<xref topicid="545577" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624928">Mt. Sinai</xref>
, and brought them to the Promised Land. 
</p>


-<p>
Historical and anthropological studies present formidable objections to the continuity of YHWH worship from 
<xref topicid="4992" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597916">Adam</xref>
(the biblical first man) to 
<xref topicid="393555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses</xref>
. The Hebrew tradition itself, moreover, does not unanimously support even the more modest claim of the continuity of YHWH worship from Abraham to Moses. This lack of continuity is demonstrated in 
<xref topicid="198216" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624929">Exodus</xref>
6:3, which says that God revealed himself to the patriarchs not as YHWH but as El Shaddai—an archaic epithet of unknown meaning that is not specifically Israelite but is found throughout the patriarchal narratives and in the 
<xref topicid="304284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624930">Book of Job</xref>
. The epithet El Elyon (God Most High) also appears frequently in the patriarchal narratives. Neither of these epithets is used in postpatriarchal narratives (excepting the 
<xref topicid="514202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624931">Book of Ruth</xref>
). Other compounds with El are unique to 
<xref topicid="228794" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624932">Genesis</xref>
: El Olam (God the Everlasting One), El Bethel (God Bethel), and El Roʾi (God of Vision). An additional peculiarity of the patriarchal stories is their use of the phrase “God of my [your, his] father.” All these epithets have been taken as evidence that patriarchal religion differed from the worship of YHWH that began with Moses. A relation to a patron god was defined by revelations starting with Abraham (who never refers to the God of his father) and continuing with a succession of “founders” of his worship. Attached to the founder and his family, as befits the patron of wanderers, this unnamed deity acquired various Canaanite epithets (El, Elyon, Olam, Bethel, Qone Eretz [“Possessor of the Land”]) only after their immigration into Canaan. Whether the name of YHWH was known to the patriarchs is doubtful. It is significant that while the epithets Shaddai and El occur frequently in pre-Mosaic and Mosaic-age names, YHWH appears as an element only in the names of Yehoshuaʿ (Joshua) and perhaps of Jochebed—persons who were closely associated with Moses. 
</p>


-<p>
The patriarchs are depicted as objects of God’s blessing, protection, and providential care. Their response is loyalty and obedience and observance of a cult (i.e., a system of religious beliefs and practices) whose ordinary expression is 
<xref topicid="515665" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sacrifice</xref>
, vow, and prayer at an altar, stone pillar, or 
<xref topicid="515425" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sacred</xref>
tree. Circumcision was a distinctive mark of the cult community. The 
<xref topicid="192308" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624933">eschatology</xref>
(doctrine of ultimate destiny) of their faith was God’s promise of land and a great progeny. Any flagrant contradictions between patriarchal and later mores have presumably been censored; yet distinctive features of the post-Mosaic religion are absent. The God of the patriarchs shows nothing of YHWH’s “jealousy”; no religious tension or contrast with their neighbours appears, and idolatry is scarcely an issue. The patriarchal covenant differed from the Mosaic, Sinaitic covenant in that it was modeled upon a royal grant to favourites and imposed no obligations as conditions of the people’s happiness. Evidently not the same as the later religion of Israel, the patriarchal religion prepared the way for the later one through its familial basis, its personal call by the Deity, and its response of loyalty and obedience to him. 
</p>


-<p>
Little can be said of the relation between the religion of the patriarchs and the religions of Canaan. Known points of contact between them are the divine epithets mentioned above. Like the God of the fathers, 
<xref topicid="181687" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624937">El</xref>
, the head of the Ugaritic pantheon, was depicted as both a judgmental and a compassionate deity. 
<xref topicid="47227" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624936">Baal</xref>
(Lord), the aggressive young agricultural deity of Ugarit, is remarkably absent from Genesis. Yet the socioeconomic situation of the patriarchs was so different from the urban, mercantile, and monarchical background of the Ugaritic myths as to render any comparisons highly questionable.

According to Hebrew tradition, a famine caused the migration to Egypt of the band of 12 Hebrew families that later made up a tribal league in the land of Israel. The schematic character of this tradition does not impair the historicity of a migration to Egypt, an enslavement by Egyptians, and an escape from Egypt under an inspired leader by some component of the later Israelite tribes.

Tradition gives the following account of the birth of the nation. At the 
<xref topicid="198216" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Exodus</xref>
from Egypt (13th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), YHWH showed his faithfulness and power by liberating the Israelites from bondage and punishing their oppressors with plagues and drowning them in the sea. At Sinai he made the Israelites his people and gave them the terms of his covenant, regulating their conduct toward him and each other so as to make them a holy nation. After sustaining them miraculously during their 40-year trek in the wilderness, he enabled them to take the land that he had promised to their fathers, the patriarchs. Central to these events is Moses, who was commissioned by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, mediate God’s covenant with them, and bring them to Canaan.

Behind the legends and the multiform law collections, it is possible to discern a historical figure to whom the legends and the legislative activity can be attached. And it is precisely Moses’ unusual combination of roles that makes him credible as a historical figure. Like

<headtitle>Mosaic religion</headtitle>


-<p>
The distinctive features of Israelite religion appear with Moses. The proper name of Israel’s God, YHWH, was revealed and interpreted to Moses as meaning 
<e>ehye asher ehye</e>
—an enigmatic phrase of infinite suggestiveness, literally meaning “I am/shall be what I am/shall be.” The covenant, defining Israel’s obligations, is ascribed to Moses’ mediation. It is impossible to determine what rulings go back to Moses, but the Decalogue, or 
<xref topicid="587032" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624953">Ten Commandments</xref>
, presented in chapter 20 of 
<xref topicid="198216" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Exodus</xref>
and chapter 5 of 
<xref topicid="159740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624954">Deuteronomy</xref>
, and the larger and smaller covenant codes in Exodus 20:22–23:33 and 34:11–26 are held by critics to contain early covenant law. From them the following features may be noted: the rules are formulated as God’s utterances—i.e., expressions of his sovereign will, directed toward and often explicitly addressed to the people at large, Moses merely conveying the sovereign’s message to his subjects—and, publication being of the essence of the rules, the people as a whole are held responsible for their observance. 
</p>


-<p>
The liberation from Egypt laid upon Israel the obligation of exclusive loyalty to YHWH. This meant eschewing all other gods—including idols venerated as such—and the elimination of all magical recourses. The worship of YHWH was aniconic (without images); even figures that might serve in his worship were banned, apparently because their use suggested theurgy (the art or technique of influencing or controlling a god by fixing his presence in a particular place and making him accessible). Although there is a mythological background behind some cultic terminology (e.g., “a pleasing odour to YHWH” and “my bread”), 
<xref topicid="515665" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sacrifice</xref>
is conceived as tribute or is regarded (in priestly writings) as purely a sacrament—i.e., as a material means of interacting with or making a connection to God. Hebrew festivals also have no mythological basis; they either celebrate God’s bounty (e.g., at the ingathering of the harvest) or his saving acts (e.g., at the festival of unleavened bread, which is a memorial of the Exodus). 
</p>


-<p>
The values of life and limb, labour, and social solidarity were protected in the rules governing interpersonal relations. The involuntary perpetual 
<xref topicid="548305" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">slavery</xref>
of Hebrews was abolished, and a seven-year limit was set on bondage. The humanity of slaves was defended: one who beat his slave to death was liable to death; if he maimed a slave, he was required to set the slave free. Murderers were denied asylum and could not ransom themselves from death, and for deliberate and severe bodily injuries the 
<e>lex talionis</e>
—the principle of “an 
<xref topicid="199341" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">eye for an eye</xref>
”—was ordained (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="581485" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624516">talion</xref>
). Theft and harm to property were punished monetarily rather than by death. 
</p>

<p>Moral exhortations called for solidarity with the poor and the helpless and for brotherly assistance to those in need. Institutions were created—e.g., the sabbatical, or seventh, fallow year, in which land was not cultivated—to embody such exhortations in practice.</p>


-<p>
Since the goal of the Israelites was the conquest of a land, their religion had warlike features. Organized as an army (called “the hosts of YHWH” in Exodus 12:41), they encamped in a protective square around their palladium—the tent housing the 
<xref topicid="34867" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ark</xref>
in which rested the stone “Tablets of the Covenant.” When journeying, the sacred objects were carried and guarded by the 
<xref topicid="337994" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624961">Levite</xref>
tribe or clan, whose rivals, the Aaronites, exercised a monopoly on the priesthood. God, sometimes called “the warrior,” marched with the army; in war, part of the booty was delivered to his ministers.

<headtitle>The period of the conquest and settlement of Canaan</headtitle>


-<p>
The conquest of Canaan was remembered as a continuation of God’s marvels at the Exodus. The 
<xref topicid="306217" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jordan River</xref>
was split asunder, the walls of 
<xref topicid="302707" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624962">Jericho</xref>
fell at Israel’s shout, the enemy was seized with divinely inspired terror, and the sun stood still in order to enable Israel to exploit its victory. Such stories are not necessarily the work of a later age; they reflect rather the impact of these victories on the actors in the drama, who felt themselves successful by the grace of God. 
</p>


-<p>
A complex process of occupation, involving both battles of annihilation and treaty agreements with indigenous peoples, has been simplified in the biblical account of the wars of 
<xref topicid="306505" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624963">Joshua</xref>
(13th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Gradually, the unity of the invaders dissolved (most scholars believe that the invading element was only part of the Hebrew settlement in Canaan; other Hebrews, long since settled in Canaan from patriarchal times, then joined the invaders’ covenant league). Individual tribes made their way with varying success against the residue of Canaanite resistance. New enemies, Israel’s neighbours to the east and west, appeared, and the period of the judges (leaders, or champions) began. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<xref topicid="307473" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597920">Book of Judges</xref>
, the main witness for the period, does not speak with one voice on the religious situation. Its editorial framework describes repeated cycles of apostasy, oppression, appeal to God, and relief through a champion sent by God. Israel’s troubles prior to the institution of the monarchy under 
<xref topicid="525442" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597921">Saul</xref>
(11th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) were caused by the weakness of the disunited tribes and were thus accounted for by the covenantal sin of apostasy. The individual stories, however, present a different picture. Apostasy does not figure in the exploits of the judges 
<xref topicid="180903" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624964">Ehud</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="154736" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624965">Deborah</xref>

, and 
<xref topicid="520746" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624967">Samson</xref>
; YHWH has no rival, and faith in him is periodically confirmed by the saviours he sends to rescue Israel from its neighbours. This faith is shared by all the tribes; it is owing to their common cult that a 
<xref topicid="337994" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Levite</xref>
from Bethlehem could serve first at an Ephraimite and later also at a Danite sanctuary. The religious bond, preserved by the common cult, enabled the tribes to work together under the leadership of elders or an inspired champion in time of danger or religious scandal. 
</p>


-<p>
Both written and archaeological testimonies, however, point to the Hebrews’ adoption of 
<xref topicid="91488" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Canaanite</xref>
cults—the Baal worship of 
<xref topicid="233335" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597923">Gideon</xref>
’s family and neighbours in Ophrah in Judges, chapter 6, is an example. The many cultic figurines (usually female) found in Israelite levels of Palestinian archaeological sites also give colour to the sweeping indictments of the framework of the Book of Judges. But these phenomena belonged to the private, popular religion; the national God, YHWH, remained one—Baal sent no prophets to Israel—though YHWH’s claim to exclusive worship was obviously not effectual. Nor did his cult conform with later orthodoxy; Micah’s idol in Judges, chapter 17, and Gideon’s 
<xref topicid="189590" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624968">ephod</xref>
(priestly or religious garment) were considered apostasies by the editor, in accord with the dogma that whatever is not orthodoxy is apostasy—heterodoxy (nonconformity) being unrecognized and simply equated with apostasy. 
</p>


-<p>
To the earliest sanctuaries and altars honoured as patriarchal foundations—at 
<xref topicid="1433442" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shechem</xref>
, Bethel, Beersheba, and 
<xref topicid="259126" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebron</xref>
in Cisjordan (west of the Jordan); and at Mahanaim, Penuel, and Mizpah in Transjordan (east of the Jordan)—were added new sanctuaries and altars at Dan, Shiloh, Ramah, Gibeon, and elsewhere. A single priestly family could not operate all these establishments, and so Levites rose to the priesthood; at private sanctuaries even non-Levites might be consecrated as priests. The 
<xref topicid="34871" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624960">Ark of the Covenant</xref>
was housed in the Shiloh sanctuary, staffed by priests of the house of Eli, who traced their consecration back to Egypt. But the ark remained a portable palladium in wartime; Shiloh was not regarded as its final resting place. The law in Exodus 20:24–26, which authorized a plurality of altar sites and the simplest forms of construction (earth and rough stone), suited the plain conditions of this period.

The decentralized tribal league could not cope with the constant pressure of external enemies—camel-riding desert marauders who pillaged harvests annually and iron-weaponed

) who controlled key points in the hill country occupied by the Israelites. In the face of such threats, a central authority that could mobilize the forces of the entire league and create a standing army had to be established. Two attitudes were distilled in the crisis—one conservative and anti-monarchic, the other radical and pro-monarchic. The conservative attitude appears first in Gideon’s refusal to found a dynasty in Judges 8:23: “I will not rule you,” he tells the people, “my son will not rule over you; YHWH will…!” This theocratic view pervades one of the two contrasting accounts of the founding of the monarchy fused in chapters 8–12 of the First Book of 
<xref topicid="520808" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Samuel</xref>
(
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="520808" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1640571">Samuel, books of</xref>
). The popular demand for a king was viewed as a rejection of the kingship of God, and in response to the demand there appeared a series of inspired saviours, from Moses and 
<xref topicid="277" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1640572">Aaron</xref>
(14th–13th century

to 
<xref topicid="520794" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624970">Samuel</xref>
(11th century

<xref topicid="520794" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Samuel</xref>
9:16). Both accounts represent the seer-judge Samuel as the key figure in the founding of Israel’s monarchy, and it is not unlikely that the two attitudes struggled within him.

The essence of the Davidic innovation was the idea that, in addition to divine election through Samuel and public acclamation, 
<xref topicid="152497" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">David</xref>
had received God’s promise of an eternal dynasty; a conditional (perhaps earlier) and an unconditional (perhaps later) form of this promise exist in 
<xref topicid="481091" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624973">Psalms</xref>
, chapter 132 and 2 Samuel, chapter 7, respectively. In its developed form, the promise was conceived of as a covenant with David, paralleling the covenant with Israel and instrumental in the latter’s fulfillment—the covenant being that God would channel his benefactions to Israel through the chosen dynasty of David. With this new status came the inviolability of the person of God’s anointed (a characteristically Davidic idea) and a court rhetoric—adapted from pagan models—in which the king was styled “the [firstborn] son of God.” An index of the king’s sanctity was his occasional performance of priestly duties. Yet the king’s mortality was never forgotten: he was never deified, and, although prayers and hymns might be said on his behalf, they were never addressed to him as a god. 
</p>


-<p>
David captured the Jebusite stronghold of 
<xref topicid="302812" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597931">Jerusalem</xref>
and made it the seat of a national monarchy (Saul had never moved the seat of his government from his birthplace, the Benjaminite town of Gibeah, about three miles north of Jerusalem). Then, fetching the ark from an obscure retreat, David installed it in his capital, asserting his royal prerogative (and obligation) to build a shrine for the national God and thus at the same time joining the symbols of the dynastic and the national covenants. This move of political genius linked the God of Israel, the chosen dynasty of David, and the chosen city of Jerusalem in a henceforth indissoluble union. 
</p>


-<p>
David planned to build a temple to house the ark, but the tenacious tradition of the ark’s portability in a tent shrine forced the postponement of the project to the reign of his son 
<xref topicid="553506" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624974">Solomon</xref>
. As part of his extensive building program, 
<xref topicid="553506" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Solomon</xref>
erected the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Temple</xref>
on a Jebusite threshing floor, located on a hill north of Jerusalem, which David had purchased to mark the spot where a plague had been halted. The ground plan of the Temple—a porch with two freestanding pillars before it, a sanctuary, and an inner sanctum—followed Syrian and Phoenician sanctuary models. A bronze “sea” resting on bulls and placed in the Temple court had a Babylonian analogue. The 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624976">Temple of Jerusalem</xref>
resembled Canaanite and other Middle Eastern religious structures but was also different from them: notably, in the inner sanctum of the Temple there was no image of God but only the ancient ark covered by the wings of large 
<xref topicid="109581" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624526">cherubim</xref>
. YHWH, who was enthroned upon celestial cherubim, was thus symbolically present in the Temple. 
</p>


-<p>
Alongside a brief inaugural poem in 1 
<xref topicid="318629" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624977">Kings</xref>
8:12–13, an extensive (and, in its present form, later) prayer expresses the distinctively biblical view of the Temple as a vehicle through which God provided for his people’s needs. Since no reference to sacrifice is made, not a trace appears of the standard pagan conception of temple as a vehicle through which humans provided for the gods. 
</p>


-<p>
The quality of the preserved narrative of the reign of David, which gives every indication of having come from the hand of a contemporary eyewitness, demonstrates that literature flourished under the aegis of the court. Attached to the royally sponsored Temple must have been a library and a school (in keeping with the universally attested practice of the ancient Middle East), among whose products would have been not only royal psalms but also liturgical pieces intended for the common people that eventually found their way into the book of 
<xref topicid="481091" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Psalms</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
The latest historical allusions in the 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Torah</xref>
literature (the Pentateuch) are to the period of the united monarchy—e.g., the defeat and subjugation of the peoples of Amalek, Moab (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="386718" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624979">Moabite</xref>
), and 
<xref topicid="179376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624980">Edom</xref>
by 
<xref topicid="525442" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Saul</xref>
and David, in
<xref topicid="422349" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624978"> Numbers</xref>
24:17–20. On the other hand, the polity reflected in the laws is tribal and decentralized, with no bureaucracy. Its economy is agricultural and pastoral; 
<xref topicid="550940" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">class distinctions</xref>
—apart from slave and free—are lacking; and commerce and urban life are rudimentary. A pre-monarchic background is evident, with only rare explicit reflections of the later monarchy—e.g., in Deuteronomy 17:14–20. The groundwork of the Torah literature most likely crystallized under the united monarchy. 
</p>


-<p>
In this period the traditional wisdom cultivated among the learned in neighbouring cultures came to be prized in Israel. Solomon is represented as the author of an extensive literature comparable to that of other sages in the region. His wisdom is expressly attributed to YHWH in the account of his night oracle at Gibeon (in which he asked not for power or riches but for wisdom), thus marking the adaptation to biblical thought of this common Middle Eastern genre. As set forth in 
<xref topicid="480617" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644797">Proverbs</xref>
2:5, “It is YHWH who grants wisdom; knowledge and understanding are by his command.” Patronage of wisdom literature is ascribed to the later Judahite king, 
<xref topicid="264743" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597994">Hezekiah</xref>
(8th–7th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
); the connection of wisdom with kings is also common in extra-biblical cultures. 
</p>


-<p>
Domination of all of Palestine entailed the absorption of “the rest of the 
<xref topicid="21276" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Amorites</xref>
”—the pre-Israelite population that lived chiefly in the valleys and on the coast. Their impact on Israelite religion is unknown, though some scholars contend that there was a “royally sponsored syncretism” aimed at fusing the two populations. Because popular religion incorporated pagan elements, it is likely that it did not meet the standards of the biblical writers; such elements may have increased as a result of intercourse with the newly absorbed Amorites. The court itself welcomed foreigners—Philistines, Cretans, Hittites, and Ishmaelites are named, among others—and made use of their service. Their effect on the court religion may be surmised from what is recorded concerning Solomon’s many diplomatic marriages: foreign princesses whom Solomon married brought with them the apparatus of their native cults. The king even had shrines to their gods built and maintained on the 
<xref topicid="427745" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624982">Mount of Olives</xref>
. Yet such private cults, while indeed royally sponsored, did not make the religion of the people syncretistic. 
</p>


-<p>
Such compromise with the pagan world, entailed by the widening horizons of the monarchy, violated the sanctity of the holy land of YHWH and turned the king into an idolator in the eyes of zealots. Religious opposition, combined with grievances against the organization of 
<xref topicid="213151" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">forced labour</xref>
for state projects, led to the secession of the northern tribes (headed by the

<headtitle>The period of the divided kingdom</headtitle>


-<p>
Jeroboam I (10th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), the first king of the north, now called Israel (the kingdom in the south was called 
<xref topicid="307146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Judah</xref>
), appreciated the inextricable link of Jerusalem and its sanctuary with the Davidic claim to divine election to kingship over all of Israel (the whole people, north and south). He therefore founded rival sanctuaries at the ancient cult sites of Dan and Bethel and staffed them with non-Levite priests whose symbol of YHWH’s presence was a 
<xref topicid="237545" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">golden calf</xref>
—a pedestal of divine images in ancient iconography and the equivalent of the cherubim of Jerusalem’s Temple. He also moved the autumn ingathering festival one month ahead so as to foreclose celebrating this most popular of all festivals simultaneously with Judah. 
</p>


-<p>
The Book of Kings (later divided into two books; 
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="318629" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644559">Kings, books of</xref>
) remains the almost exclusive source for the evaluation of Jeroboam’s innovations and the subsequent official religion of the north down to the mid-8th century. However, this work has severe limitations as a source for religious history. It is dominated by a dogmatic historiography that regards the whole enterprise of the north as one long apostasy ending in a deserved disaster. The culmination of Kings’ history with the exile of Judah shows that it came from the northern kingdom. Yet the evaluation of Judah’s official religion is subject to an equally dogmatic standard: namely, the royal adherence to the Deuteronomic rule of a single cult site. The author considered the Temple of Solomon to be the cult site chosen by God, according to Deuteronomy, chapter 12, the existence of which rendered all other sites illegitimate. Every king of Judah is judged according to whether or not he did away with all places of worship outside Jerusalem. The date of this criterion may be inferred from the indifference toward it of all persons prior to Hezekiah—e.g., the prophets 
<xref topicid="184625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624983">Elijah</xref>
and 
<xref topicid="184750" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624984">Elisha</xref>
and Jehoiada, a priest of Jerusalem (all 9th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). 
</p>


-<p>
Another serious limitation is the restriction of Kings’ purview: excepting the Elijah-Elisha stories, it recognizes only the royally sponsored cult and pays scant attention to popular religion. In the mid-8th century the writings of the classical prophets, starting with 
<xref topicid="21356" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Amos</xref>
, first appeared. These take in the people as a whole, in contrast to Kings; on the other hand, their interest in 
<xref topicid="590596" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624985">theodicy</xref>
(the problem of reconciling the presumed goodness of God with the existence of evil in the world) and their polemical tendency to exaggerate and generalize what they deem evil must be taken into consideration before accepting their statements as history per se (

</p>


-<p>
For half a century after the north’s secession (
<e>c.</e>

<e ty="s">bce</e>
), the religious situation in Jerusalem was unchanged. The distaff side of the royal household perpetuated, and even augmented, the pagan cults. King Asa (reigned

<e ty="s">bce</e>
) is credited with a general purge, including the destruction of an image made for the goddess

by the queen mother, granddaughter of an

(“consecrated men”—conventionally rendered as “sodomites,” or “male sacred prostitutes”).

<xref topicid="9952" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598000">Ahab</xref>
(reigned 874–853

<xref topicid="303679" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1597999">Jezebel</xref>
(died 
<e>c.</e>
843 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Jezebel was accompanied by a large entourage of sacred personnel to staff the temple of Baal and 
<xref topicid="38192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Asherah</xref>
that 
<xref topicid="9952" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ahab</xref>
built for her in 
<xref topicid="520284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624988">Samaria</xref>
, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. Although Ahab’s orthodoxy was in every other respect irreproachable, some members of his court may have worshipped the gods of the foreign princess. Jezebel’s persecution of the prophets of YWHW—conduct untypical of a polytheist except in self-defense—was probably prompted by the fierce opposition to non-YHWH cults in Israel. 
<xref topicid="184625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Elijah</xref>
’s assertion that the whole country apostatized is a piece of hyperbole based on the view that whoever did not actively fight Jezebel was implicated in her polluted cult. Such must have been the view of the prophets, whose fallen were the first 
<xref topicid="367142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">martyrs</xref>
to die for the glory of God. The quality of their opposition may be gauged by Elijah’s summary execution of the foreign Baal cultists after they failed at the contest on 
<xref topicid="96159" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624989">Mt. Carmel</xref>
(Elijah and the priests of Baal appealed respectively to YHWH and Baal to set a pile of wood ablaze to prove whose god was truly God). A three-year drought (attested also in Phoenician sources), declared by 
<xref topicid="184625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Elijah</xref>
to be punishment for the sin of apostasy, did much to kindle the prophets’ zeal.

-<p>
To judge from the stories of 
<xref topicid="184750" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Elisha</xref>
, devotion to the cult of 
<xref topicid="47227" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Baal</xref>
existed in the capital city, Samaria, but was not felt in the countryside. The religious tone there was set by the popular prophets and their adherents (“the sons of the prophets”). In popular consciousness these men were wonder-workers—healing the sick and reviving the dead, foretelling the future, and helping to find lost objects. To the biblical narrator, they witnessed the working of God in Israel. Elijah’s rage at the Israelite king Ahaziah’s recourse to the pagan god Baalzebub, Elisha’s cure of the Syrian military leader Naaman’s leprosy, and anonymous prophets’ directives and predictions in matters of peace and war all served to glorify God. Indeed, the equation of Israel’s prosperity with God’s interest generated the first appearance of the issue of “true” and “false” prophecy. The fact that prophecy of success could turn out to be a snare is exemplified in a story of conflict between the prophet of doom Micaiah (9th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) and 400 unanimous prophets of victory who lured King Ahab to his death. The poignancy of the issue is highlighted by Micaiah’s acknowledgment that the 400 were also prophets of YHWH—but inspired by him deliberately with a “lying spirit.”

<headtitle>The emergence of the literary prophets</headtitle>


-<p>
By the mid-8th century, one hundred years of chronic warfare between Israel and 
<xref topicid="32015" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Aram</xref>
had finally ended—the Aramaeans having suffered heavy blows from the Assyrians. King Jeroboam II (8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) undertook to restore the imperial sway of the north over its neighbour, and Jonah’s prophecy that Jeroboam would extend Israel’s borders from the 
<xref topicid="154254" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Dead Sea</xref>
to the entrance to Hamath (Syria) was borne out. The well-to-do expressed their relief in lavish attentions to the institutions of worship and to their private mansions. But the strain of the prolonged warfare showed in the polarization of society between the wealthy few who had profited from the war and the masses whom it had ravaged and impoverished. Dismay at the dissolution of Israelite society animated a new breed of prophets—the literary or classical prophets, the first of whom was 
<xref topicid="21356" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598011">Amos</xref>
(8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), a Judahite who went north to Bethel. 
</p>

<p>The point that apostasy would set God against the community was made in early prophecy; the idea that violation of the social and ethical injunctions of the covenant would have the same result was first proclaimed by Amos. Amos almost ignored idolatry, denouncing instead the corruption and callousness of the oligarchy and rulers. He proclaimed the religious exercises of such villains to be loathsome to God; on their account Israel would be oppressed from the entrance of Hamath to the Dead Sea and exiled from its land.</p>


-<p>
The westward push of the Neo-Assyrian empire in the mid-8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
soon brought Aram and Israel to their knees. In 733–732 
<xref topicid="39555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Assyria</xref>
took Gilead and Galilee from Israel and captured Aramaean Damascus; in 721 Samaria, the Israelite capital, fell. The northern kingdom sought to survive through alliances with Assyria and Egypt; its kings came and went in rapid succession. The troubled society’s malaise was interpreted by Hosea, a prophet of the northern kingdom (Israel), as a forgetting of God (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="272573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644654">Hosea, Book of</xref>
). As a result, in his view, all authority had evaporated: the king was scoffed at, priests became hypocrites, and pleasure seeking became the order of the day. The monarchy was godless, putting its trust in arms, fortifications, and alliances with great powers. Salvation, however, lay in none of these but in repentance and reliance upon God.

<headtitle>Prophecy in the southern kingdom</headtitle>

Judah was subjected to such intense pressure to join an Israelite-Aramaean coalition against Assyria that its king 
<xref topicid="9996" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624991">Ahaz</xref>
(8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) instead submitted to

in return for relief. 
<xref topicid="9996" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ahaz</xref>
introduced a new Aramaean-style altar in the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Temple of Jerusalem</xref>
and adopted other foreign customs that are counted against him in the 
<xref topicid="537703" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Kings</xref>
. It was at this time that 
<xref topicid="295133" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598014">Isaiah</xref>
prophesied in Jerusalem (
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="295147" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624995">Isaiah, Book of</xref>
). At first (under
<xref topicid="621142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624993"> Uzziah</xref>
, Ahaz’s prosperous grandfather) his message emphasized the social and religious corruption of Judah, stressing the new prophetic themes of indifference to God (which went hand in hand with a thriving cult) and the fateful importance of social morality. Under Ahaz the political crisis evoked 
<xref topicid="295133" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Isaiah</xref>
’s appeals for trust in God, with the warning that the “hired razor from across the Euphrates” would shave Judah clean as well. Isaiah interpreted the inexorable advance of Assyria as God’s chastisement. The “rod of God’s wrath,” Assyria would be broken on Judah’s mountains because of its insolence when God was finished with his purgative work. Then the nations of the world, which had been subjugated by Assyria, would recognize the God of Israel as the lord of history. A renewed Israel would prosper under the reign of an ideal Davidic king, all humanity would flock to 
<xref topicid="657453" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624994">Zion</xref>
(the hill symbolizing Jerusalem) to learn the ways of YHWH and to submit to his adjudication, and universal peace would prevail (
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="192308" tocid="" ty="1" refid="19506">eschatology</xref>
). 
</p>


-<p>
The prophecy of Micah (8th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), also from Judah, was contemporary with that of Isaiah and touched on similar themes—e.g., the vision of universal peace is found in both their books (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="379776" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624996">Micah, Book of</xref>
). Unlike Isaiah, however, who believed in the inviolability of Jerusalem, Micah shocked his audience with the announcement that the wickedness of its rulers would cause 
<xref topicid="657453" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zion</xref>
to become a plowed field, Jerusalem a heap of ruins, and the Temple Mount a wooded height. Moreover, from the precedence of social morality over the cult, Micah drew the extreme conclusion that the cult had no ultimate value and that God’s requirement of humanity could be summed up as “to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.”

<headtitle>Reforms in the southern kingdom</headtitle>


-<p>
According to the 
<xref topicid="302689" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625008">Book of Jeremiah</xref>
(about 100 years later), Micah’s prophetic threat to Jerusalem had caused King 
<xref topicid="264743" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hezekiah</xref>
(reigned 
<e>c.</e>
715–
<e>c.</e>
686 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) to placate God—possibly an allusion to the cult reform instituted by the king in order to cleanse Judah of various pagan practices. A heightened concern over assimilatory trends resulted in his also outlawing certain practices considered legitimate up to his time. Thus, in addition to removing the bronze serpent that had been ascribed to Moses (and that had become a fetish), the reform did away with the local altars and stone pillars, the venerable (patriarchal) antiquity of which did not save them from the taint of imitation of Canaanite practice. Hezekiah’s reform, part of a policy of restoration that had political as well as religious implications, was the most significant effect of the fall of the northern kingdom on official religion. The outlook of the reformers is suggested by the catalog in 2 Kings, chapter 17, of religious offenses that had caused the fall; the objects of Hezekiah’s purge closely resembled them. Hezekiah’s reform is the first historical evidence for Deuteronomy’s doctrine of cult centralization. Similarities between Deuteronomy and the 
<xref topicid="272573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624997">Book of Hosea</xref>
lend colour to the supposition that the reform movement in Judah, which culminated a century later under King 
<xref topicid="306538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624998">Josiah</xref>
, was sparked by attitudes inherited from the north.

Hezekiah was the leading figure in a western coalition of states that joined with the Babylonian king 
<xref topicid="376226" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598033">Merodach-Baladan II</xref>
in a rebellion against the Assyrian king 
<xref topicid="534613" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598032">Sennacherib</xref>
shortly after the Assyrian’s accession in 705 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
. When Sennacherib appeared in the west in 701, the rebellion collapsed; Egypt sent a force to aid the rebels but was defeated. His kingdom overwhelmed, Hezekiah offered tribute to Sennacherib; the Assyrian, however, pressed for the surrender of Jerusalem. In despair, Hezekiah turned to the prophet Isaiah for an oracle. While condemning the king’s reliance upon Egyptian help, Isaiah stood firm in his faith that Jerusalem’s destiny precluded its fall into heathen hands. The king held fast, and Sennacherib, for reasons still obscure, suddenly retired from Judah and returned home. This unlooked-for deliverance of the city may have been regarded as a vindication of the prophet’s faith and was doubtless an inspiration to the rebels against Babylonia a century later. For the present, although Jerusalem was intact, the country had been devastated and the kingdom turned into a vassal state of Assyria.

-<p>
During the long and peaceful reign of 
<xref topicid="361314" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598036">Manasseh</xref>
in the 7th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, Judah was a submissive ally of Assyria. Manasseh’s forces served in the building and military operations of the Assyrian kings 
<xref topicid="192210" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598039">Esarhaddon</xref>
(reigned 680–669 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) and 
<xref topicid="38437" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598037">Ashurbanipal</xref>
(reigned 668–627 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Judah benefitted from the increase in commerce that resulted from the political unification of the entire 
<xref topicid="381192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle East</xref>
. The prophet 
<xref topicid="656579" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1624999">Zephaniah</xref>
(7th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) attests to heavy foreign influence on the mores of Jerusalem—merchants who adopted foreign dress, cynics who lost faith in the power of YHWH to do anything, and people who worshipped the pagan host of heaven on their roofs (
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="656582" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625000">Zephaniah, Book of</xref>
). Manasseh’s court was the centre of such influences. The royal sanctuary became the home of a congeries of foreign gods; the sun, astral deities, and Asherah (the female fertility deity) all had their cults alongside YHWH. The countryside also was provided with pagan altars and priests, alongside local YHWH altars that were revived. Presumably, at least some of the 
<xref topicid="69685" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">blood</xref>
that Manasseh is said to have spilled freely in Jerusalem must have belonged to YHWH’s devotees. No prophecy is dated to his long reign. 
</p>


-<p>
With the death of 
<xref topicid="38437" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625001">Ashurbanipal</xref>
, Assyria’s power faded quickly. The young king of Judah, 
<xref topicid="306538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598040">Josiah</xref>
(reigned 
<e>c.</e>
640–609 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), had already set in motion a vigorous movement of independence and restoration, a cardinal aspect of which was religious. First came the purge of foreign cults in Jerusalem under the aegis of the high priest Hilkiah; then the countryside was cleansed. In the course of renovating the Temple, a scroll of Moses’ Torah (by scholarly consensus an edition of Deuteronomy) was found. Anxious to abide by its injunctions, 
<xref topicid="306538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Josiah</xref>
had the local YHWH altars polluted to render them unusable and collected their priests in Jerusalem. The celebration of the 
<xref topicid="445894" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Passover</xref>
that year was concentrated in the Temple, as it had not been “since the days of the judges who judged Israel,” according to 2 Kings 23:22, or since the days of Samuel, according to 2 
<xref topicid="116220" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625002">Chronicles</xref>
35:18; both references reflect the theory of the 
<xref topicid="159731" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Deuteronomic</xref>
(Josianic) reformers that the Shiloh sanctuary was the precursor of the Jerusalem Temple as the sole legitimate site of worship in Israel (as demanded by Deuteronomy, chapter 12). To seal the reform, the king convoked a representative assembly and directed it to enter into a covenant with God over the newfound Torah. For the first time, the power of the state was enlisted on behalf of the ancient covenant and in obedience to a covenant document. It was a major step toward the establishment of a sacred canon. 
</p>


-<p>
Josiah envisaged the restoration of Davidic authority over the entire domain of ancient Israel, and the retreat of Assyria facilitated his ambitions—until he became fatally embroiled in the struggle of the powers over the dying empire. His death in 609 was doubtless a setback for his religious policy as well as his political program. To be sure, the royally sponsored syncretism of Manasseh’s time was not revived, but there is evidence of a recrudescence of unofficial local altars. Whether references in the Book of 
<xref topicid="302676" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jeremiah</xref>
and the 
<xref topicid="199492" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625004">Book of Ezekiel</xref>
to child sacrifice to YHWH reflect post-Josianic practices is uncertain. Yet there is stronger indication of private recourse to pagan cults in the worsening political situation. 
</p>


-<p>
The unsettled conditions following Assyria’s fall dismayed the devotees of YHWH, who had not been prepared for it by prophecy. Their mood finds expression in the oracles of the prophet Habakkuk in the last years of the 7th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
(
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="250728" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625005">Habakkuk, Book of</xref>
). Confessing perplexity at God’s toleration of the success of the wicked in subjugating the righteous, the prophet affirms his faith in the coming 
<xref topicid="520007" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">salvation</xref>
of YHWH, tarry though it might. And in the meantime, “the righteous must live in his faith.” 
</p>


-<p>
Despite these expectations of salvation, the situation grew worse as Judah was caught in the Babylonian-Egyptian rivalry. Some attributed the deterioration to Manasseh’s sin of moving toward 
<xref topicid="469156" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">polytheism</xref>
. For the prophet 
<xref topicid="302676" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625009">Jeremiah</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
650–
<e>c.</e>
570 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), the Josianic era was only an interlude in Israel’s career of guilt, which went back to its origins. His pre-reform prophecies denounced Israel as a faithless wife and warned of imminent retribution at the hands of a nameless northerner. After 
<xref topicid="407575" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598049">Nebuchadrezzar II</xref>
(reigned 
<e>c.</e>
605–
<e>c.</e>
561 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) decisively defeated Egypt at Carchemish (605 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), Jeremiah identified the scourge as Babylonia. King 
<xref topicid="302380" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598054">Jehoiakim</xref>
’s attempt to be free of Babylonia ended with the exile of his successor, 
<xref topicid="302377" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625010">Jehoiachin</xref>
, along with Judah’s elite (597 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
); yet the court of the new king, 
<xref topicid="656213" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598052">Zedekiah</xref>
(reigned 597–587/586 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), persisted in plotting new revolts, relying—against all experience—on Egyptian support. Jeremiah now proclaimed a scandalous doctrine of the duty of all nations, Judah included, to submit to the divinely appointed world ruler, Nebuchadrezzar, as the only hope of avoiding destruction; a term of 70 years of submission had been set to humiliate all nations beneath Babylonia. Imprisoned for demoralizing the people, Jeremiah persisted in what was viewed as his traitorous message; Judah’s leaders, on their part, persisted in their policy, confident of Egypt and the saving power of Jerusalem’s Temple to the bitter end. 
</p>


-<p>
Jeremiah also had a message of comfort for his hearers. He foresaw the restoration of the entire people—north and south—under a new David. And since events had shown that 
<xref topicid="275376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human beings</xref>
were incapable of achieving a lasting reconciliation with God on their own, he envisioned the penitent of the future being met halfway by God, who would remake their nature so that doing his will would come naturally to them. God’s new covenant with Israel would be written on their hearts, so that they should no longer need to teach each other obedience, for young and old would know YHWH. 
</p>


-<p>
Among the exiles in Babylonia, the prophet 
<xref topicid="199484" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598057">Ezekiel</xref>
, Jeremiah’s contemporary, was haunted by the burden of Israel’s sin. He saw the defiled Temple of Manasseh’s time as present before his eyes and described God as abandoning it and Jerusalem to their fates. Although Jeremiah offered hope through submission, 
<xref topicid="199484" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezekiel</xref>
prophesied an inexorable, total destruction as the condition of reconciliation with God. The majesty of God was too grossly offended for any lesser satisfaction. The glory of God demanded Israel’s ruin, but the same cause required its restoration. Israel’s fall disgraced YHWH among the nations; to save his reputation, he must therefore restore Israel to its land. The dried bones of Israel must revive, so that they and all the nations should know that he was YHWH (Ezekiel 37). Ezekiel too foresaw the remaking of 
<xref topicid="275811" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human nature</xref>
, but as a necessity of God’s glorification; the concatenation of Israel’s sin, exile, and consequent defamation of God’s name must never be repeated. In 587/586 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
the doom prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel came true. Rebellious Jerusalem was reduced by Nebuchadrezzar, the Temple was burned, and much of Judah’s population was dispersed or deported to Babylonia.

The 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Exile</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
The survival of the religious community of exiles in Babylonia demonstrates how rooted and widespread the religion of YHWH was. Abandonment of the national religion as an outcome of the disaster is recorded of only a minority. There were some cries of despair, but the persistence of prophecy among the exiles shows that their religious vitality had not flagged. The Babylonian Jewish community, in which the cream of Judah lived, had no sanctuary or altar (in contrast to the Jewish garrison of Elephantine in Egypt); what developed in their place can be surmised from new postexilic religious forms: fixed prayer; public fasts and confessions; and assembly for the study of the Torah, which may have developed from visits to the prophets for oracular edification. The absence of a local or territorial focus must also have spurred the formation of a literary centre of communal life—the sacred canon of covenant documents that came to be the core of the present Pentateuch. Observance of the 
<xref topicid="514970" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625036">Sabbath</xref>
—a peculiarly public feature of communal life—achieved a significance among the exiles virtually equivalent to all the rest of the covenant rules together. Notwithstanding its political impotence, the exile community possessed such high spirits that foreigners were attracted to its ranks, hopeful of sharing in its future glory. This moment marks the origin of conversion to Judaism for distinctly religious reasons rather than for reasons of politics, culture, or 
<xref topicid="405644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">nationalism</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
Assurance of that future glory was given not only by Jeremiah’s and Ezekiel’s consolations, which were made credible by the fulfillment of the prophecies of doom, but also by the great comforter of the exile, the writer or writers of what is known as 
<xref topicid="159710" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Deutero-Isaiah</xref>
(Isaiah 40–66), who perceived the instrument of God’s salvation in the rise and progress of the Persian king 
<xref topicid="148758" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598059">Cyrus II</xref>
(the Great; reigned 550–529

; 
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="295147" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625037">Isaiah, Book of</xref>
). Going beyond the national hopes of Ezekiel and animated by the universal spirit of the pre-exilic Isaiah, Deutero-Isaiah saw in the miraculous restoration of Israel a means of converting the whole world to faith in Israel’s God. Israel would thus serve as “a light for the nations, that YHWH’s salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” In his conception of the vicarious suffering of God’s servant—through which atonement is made for the ignorant heathen—Deutero-Isaiah found a handle by which to grasp the enigma of faithful Israel’s lowly state among the Gentiles. The idea was destined to play a decisive role in the self-understanding of the Jewish martyrs persecuted by the Syrian king

-<p>
After conquering Babylonia, Cyrus allowed those Jews who wished to do so to return and rebuild their Temple. Although some 40,000 eventually made their way back, they were soon disillusioned and ceased their rebuilding as the glories of the restoration failed to materialize and as controversy arose with the

(522 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). The prophets Haggai and 
<xref topicid="656198" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zechariah</xref>
understood the disturbances as heralds of the imminent overthrow of the Persian empire, as a worldwide manifestation of God, and as a glorification of 
<xref topicid="656709" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zerubbabel</xref>
(

<xref topicid="251551" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625177">Haggai, Book of</xref>

<xref topicid="656201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625178">Zechariah, Book of</xref>
). Against the day of the empire’s fall, they urged the people to quickly complete the building of the Temple. The labour was resumed and completed in 516, but the prophecies remained unfulfilled. Zerubbabel then disappears from the biblical narrative, and the spirit of the community flags again. 
</p>


-<p>
The one religious constant in the vicissitudes of the restored community was the mood of repentance and the desire to win back God’s favour by adherence to the rules of his covenant. The anxiety that underlay this mood produced a hostility to strangers and encouraged a lasting conflict with the Samaritans, who asked permission to take part in rebuilding the Temple of the God whom they too worshipped. The Jews rejected the Samaritans on ill-specified but apparently ethnic and religious grounds: they felt the Samaritans to be alien to the Jewish historical community of faith and especially to its messianic hopes. Nonetheless, intermarriage between the two peoples occurred, precipitating a new crisis in 458, when the priest 
<xref topicid="199520" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezra</xref>
arrived from Babylon, intent on enforcing the regimen of the Torah. By reviving ancient laws excluding Canaanites and others and applying them to their own times and neighbours, the leaders of the Jews brought about the divorce and expulsion of several dozen non-Jewish wives and their children. Tension between the xenophobic and xenophilic in postexilic Judaism was finally resolved some two centuries later with the development of a formality of religious conversion, whereby Gentiles who so wished could be taken into the Jewish community by a single, simple procedure. 
</p>


-<p>
The decisive constitutional event of the new community was the covenant subscribed to by its leaders in 444, which made the Torah the law of the land. A charter granted to 
<xref topicid="199520" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezra</xref>
by the Persian king 
<xref topicid="36741" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598067">Artaxerxes I</xref>
empowered the latter to enforce the Torah as the imperial law for the Jews of the province Avar-nahra (“Beyond the River”), in which the district of Judah (now reduced to a small area) was located. The charter required the publication of the Torah, which in turn entailed its final editing—now plausibly ascribed to Ezra and his circle. The survival in the Torah of patent inconsistencies and disagreements with the postexilic situation indicate that its materials were by then sacrosanct, to be compiled but no longer created. But these survivals made necessary the immediate invention of a harmonizing and creative method of textual interpretation to adjust the Torah to the needs of the times. The 
<xref topicid="337994" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Levites</xref>
were trained in the art of interpreting the text to the people; the first product of the creative exegesis later known as 
<xref topicid="381628" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Midrash</xref>
(meaning “investigation” or “interpretation”; plural Midrashim) is to be found in the covenant document of 
<xref topicid="408221" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625185">Nehemiah</xref>
, chapter 9—every item of which shows development, not reproduction, of a ruling of the Torah (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="199532" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625186">Ezra and Nehemiah, books of</xref>
). Thus, the publication of the Torah as the law of the Jews laid the basis of the vast edifice of Oral Law so characteristic of later Judaism. 
</p>


-<p>
Concern over observance of the Torah was raised by the stark contrast between messianic expectations and the harsh reality of the restoration. The contrast signified God’s continued displeasure, and the only way to regain his favour was to do his will. Thus, the 
<xref topicid="359422" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625188">Book of Malachi</xref>
, named after the last of the prophets, concludes with an admonition to be mindful of the Torah of Moses. God’s displeasure, however, had always been signaled by a break in communication with him. As time passed and messianic hopes remained unfulfilled, the sense of a permanent suspension of normal relations with God took hold, and prophecy died out. God, it was believed, would some day be reconciled with his people, and a glorious revival of prophecy would then occur. For the present, however, religious vitality expressed itself in dedication to the development of institutions that would make the Torah effective in life. The course of this development is hidden from view by the dearth of sources from the Persian period. But the community that emerged into the light of history in Hellenistic times had been radically transformed by this momentous, quiet process.

dynasty, the Jews were treated even more liberally, being granted a charter to govern themselves by their own constitution—namely, the Torah. Greek influence, however, was already apparent. Some of the 29 Greek cities of Palestine attained a high level of Hellenistic culture. The mid-3rd century-
<e ty="s">bce</e>
Zenon papyri, which contain the correspondence of the business manager of a high Ptolemaic official, present a picture of a wealthy 
<xref topicid="303358" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jew</xref>
, Tobiah, who through commercial contact with the Ptolemies acquired a veneer of Hellenism, to judge at least from the pagan and religious expressions in his Greek letters. His son and especially his grandsons became ardent Hellenists. By the beginning of the 2nd century, the influence of the 
<xref topicid="260307" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625191">Hellenistic Age</xref>
in Judaea was quite strong; indeed, it has been argued that, if the Seleucids had not forcibly intervened in Jewish affairs, Judaean Judaism would have become even more syncretistic than Alexandrian Judaism. The apocryphal writer Jesus ben Sirach so bitterly denounced the Hellenizers in Jerusalem (
<e>c.</e>
180 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) that he was forced by the authorities to temper his words. 
</p>


-<p>
In the early part of the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, Hellenizing Jews took control of the high priesthood itself. As high priest from 175 to 172, 
<xref topicid="301513" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625200">Jason</xref>
established Jerusalem as a Greek city, with Greek educational institutions. His ouster by an even more extreme Hellenizing faction, which established Menelaus (died 162 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) as high priest, occasioned a civil war in which Menelaus was supported by the wealthy aristocrats and 
<xref topicid="301519" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jason</xref>
by the masses. The Syrian king 
<xref topicid="28380" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625201">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</xref>
, who initially granted exemptions and privileges to the Jews, intervened at the request of Menelaus’s party. Antiochus’s promulgation of decrees against the practice of Judaism led in 167 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
to the successful revolt of the priest 
<xref topicid="369625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625202">Mattathias</xref>
(died 166 
<e ty="s">bce</e>

(Hasmoneans; 
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="256640" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625204">Hasmonean dynasty</xref>

</e>
mirrors the fierceness of this struggle. 
</p>


-<p>
The extreme tactics employed by the Hasmoneans in their struggle with Hellenizing Jews, whose children they forcibly circumcised, indicate the inroads that Hellenism had already made. On the whole, the chief supporters of the Hellenizers were members of the wealthy urban population, while the 
<xref topicid="353829" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Maccabees</xref>
were supported by the peasants and the urban masses. Yet there is evidence that the ruthlessness exhibited by the Hasmoneans toward the Greek cities of Palestine had political rather than cultural origins and that in fact they were fighting for personal power no less than for the Torah. Indeed, some of the Jews who fought on the side of the Maccabees were idol worshippers. In any event, the Maccabees soon reached a modus vivendi with Hellenism: thus, 
<xref topicid="305833" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625211">Jonathan</xref>
(died 143/142

(

(died 103 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) actually called himself Philhellene (a lover of Hellenism); and Alexander Jannaeus (died 76 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) hired Greek mercenaries and inscribed his coins in Greek as well as in Hebrew. Greek influence reached its peak under King

I of Judaea (reigned 37–4

<headtitle>Social, political, and religious divisions</headtitle>


-<p>
During the Hellenistic period the priests were both the wealthiest class and the strongest political group among the Jews of Jerusalem. The wealthiest of the priests were the members of the Oniad family, who held the hereditary office of high priest until they were replaced by the Hasmoneans; the Temple that they supervised also functioned as a bank, where the wealth of the Temple was stored and where private individuals also deposited their money. From a social and economic point of view, therefore, 
<xref topicid="306479" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Josephus</xref>
is justified in calling the government of Judaea a 
<xref topicid="590558" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">theocracy</xref>
. Opposition to the priests’ oppressive rule arose among an urban middle-class group known as scribes (

-<e>

<xref topicid="552354" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">soferim</xref>

</e>
), who based their interpretation of and instruction in the Torah on an 
<xref topicid="212142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">oral tradition</xref>
probably going back to the time of the return from the 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Exile</xref>
(538 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
and after). A special group of scribes known as Hasidim, or “Pietists,” became the forerunners of the 
<xref topicid="455129" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598077">Pharisees</xref>
, or “Separatists”—middle-class Jewish scholars who reinterpreted the Torah and the prophetic writings to meet the needs of their times. The Hasidim joined the Hasmoneans in the struggle against the Hellenizers, though on religious rather than political grounds. 
</p>


-<p>
Josephus held that the Pharisees and the other Jewish parties were philosophical schools, and some modern scholars have argued that the groupings were primarily along economic and social lines; but the chief distinctions among them were religious and go back well before the Maccabean revolt. Some modern scholars have sought to interpret the Pharisees’ opposition to the 
<xref topicid="515862" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598078">Sadducees</xref>
—wealthy, conservative Jews who accepted the Torah alone as authoritative—as based on an urban-rural dichotomy, but a very large share of Pharisaic concern was with agricultural matters. To associate the rabbis with urbanization seems a distortion. The chief support for the Pharisees came from the lower classes, whether in the country or in the city. 
</p>


-<p>
The equation of Pharisaic with “normative” Judaism can no longer be supported, at any rate not before the destruction of the Temple in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. According to the Palestinian 
<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Talmud</xref>
(the annotations and interpretations of the Oral Law compiled by Palestinian Jewish scholars in the 3rd and 4th centuries 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), there were 24 types of “heretics” in Palestine in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, thus indicating much divergence among Jews; this picture is confirmed by Josephus, who notes numerous instances of religious leaders who claimed to be prophets and who obtained considerable followings. 
</p>


-<p>
The chief doctrine of the Pharisees was that the Oral Law had been revealed to Moses at the same time as the Written Law. In their exegesis and interpretation of this oral tradition, particularly under the 
<xref topicid="487879" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">rabbi</xref>

<xref topicid="265877" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598080">Hillel</xref>
(1st century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), the Pharisees were flexible, and their regard for the public won them considerable support. That the Maccabean ruler 
<xref topicid="305011" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598081">John Hyrcanus I</xref>
(reigned 135–104 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) broke with them and that Josephus set their number at merely “more than 6,000” at the time of King 
<xref topicid="263437" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Herod</xref>
indicates that they were less numerous and less influential than Josephus would have his readers believe. The Pharisees stressed the importance of performing all the commandments, including those that appeared to be of only minor significance; those who were particularly strict in their observance of the Levitical rules were known as 
<e>ḥaverim</e>
(“companions”). They believed in the providential guidance of the universe, in angels, in reward and punishment in the world to come, and in 
<xref topicid="499816" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645846">resurrection</xref>
of the dead, all of which were opposed by the Sadducees. However, in finding a modus vivendi with Hellenism, at least in form and in terminology, the Pharisees did not differ greatly from the Sadducees. Indeed, the supreme council of the Great Synagogue (or Great Assembly) of the Pharisees was modeled on Hellenistic religious and social associations. Because they did not take an active role in fostering the rebellion against Rome in 66–70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, their leader, 
<xref topicid="304443" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644735">Johanan ben Zakkai</xref>
, obtained Roman permission to establish an academy at Yavneh (Jamnia), where in effect the Pharisees replaced the cult of the Temple with a regimen of study and prayer. 
</p>


-<p>
The Sadducees and their subsidiary group, the 
<xref topicid="71349" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598082">Boethusians</xref>
(Boethosaeans), who were identified with the great landowners and priestly families, were more deeply influenced by Hellenization. The rise of the Pharisees may thus be seen, in a sense, as a reaction against the more profound Hellenization favoured by the Sadducees, who were allied with the philhellenic Hasmoneans. From the time of John Hyrcanus the Sadducees generally held a higher position than the Pharisees and were favoured by the Jewish rulers. Religiously more circumscribed than the Pharisees, they rejected the idea of a revealed oral interpretation of the Torah, even though they had their own tradition, the 
<e>sefer gezerot </e>
(“book of decrees” or “decisions”). They similarly rejected the inspiration of the prophetic books of the Bible, as well as the Pharisaic beliefs in angels, rewards and punishments in the world to come, providential governance of human events, and resurrection of the dead. For them Judaism centred on the Temple; but, about 10 years before the Temple’s destruction in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, the Pharisees prevented the Sadducees from entering it, and in effect the Sadducees disappeared from Jewish life. 
</p>


-<p>
Not constituting any particular party were the unlearned rural masses known as 
<e>ʿamme ha-aretz </e>
(“people of the land”), who were found among both the Pharisees and the Sadducees and even among the Samaritans. The 
<e>ʿamme ha-aretz </e>
did not give the prescribed tithes, did not observe the laws of purity, and were neglectful of the laws of prayer; so great was the antagonism between them and the learned Pharisees that the biblical verse “Cursed be he who lies with any kind of beast” was applied to their daughters. The antipathy was reciprocated, for in the same passage in the 
<xref topicid="47713" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Talmud</xref>
(the annotations and interpretations of the Oral Law compiled by Babylonian Jewish scholars in the 5th century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) are added the words, “Greater is the hatred wherewith the 
<e>ʿamme ha-aretz</e>
hate the scholar than the hatred wherewith the heathens hate Israel.” That there was 
<xref topicid="551322" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">social mobility</xref>
, however, is clear from the Talmudic dictum, “Heed the sons of the 
<e>ʿamme ha-aretz</e>
, for they will be the living source of the Torah.” 
</p>


-<p>
Proselytes (converts) to Judaism, though not constituting a class, became increasingly numerous in Palestine and especially in the 
<xref topicid="161756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Diaspora</xref>
(the Jews living beyond Palestine). Scholarly estimates of the Jewish population of this era range from 700,000 to 5,000,000 in Palestine and from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 in the Diaspora, the prevailing opinion being that about one-tenth of the population of the Mediterranean world at the beginning of the Christian era was Jewish. Such numbers represent a considerable increase from previous eras and must have included large numbers of proselytes. In a probable allusion to proselytism, in 139 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
the Jews of Rome were charged by the praetor with attempting to contaminate Roman morals with their religion. The first large-scale conversions were conducted by John Hyrcanus and Aristobulus I, who in 130 and 103 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, respectively, forced the people of Idumaea in southern Palestine and the people of Ituraea in northern Palestine to become Jews. The eagerness of the Pharisees to win converts is attested in The 
<xref topicid="369708" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625590">Gospel According to Matthew</xref>
(23:15), which states that the Pharisees would “traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte.” To be sure, some of the proselytes, according to Josephus, did return to their pagan ways, but the majority apparently remained true to their new religion. In addition, there were many “sympathizers” with Judaism (known as 
<e>sebomenoi</e>
, “fearers of the Lord”), who observed one or more Jewish practices without being fully converted. 
</p>


-<p>
Outside the pale of Judaism in most, though not all, respects were the 
<xref topicid="520295" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Samaritans</xref>
, who, like the Sadducees, refused to recognize the validity of the Oral Law; in fact, the break between the Sadducees and the Samaritans did not occur until the conquest of Shechem by John Hyrcanus (128 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Like the later so-called 
<xref topicid="487593" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625591">Qumrān</xref>
covenanters (the monastic group associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls), they were opposed to the Jewish priesthood and the cult of the Temple, regarded Moses as a messianic figure, and forbade the 
<xref topicid="500286" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">revelation</xref>
of esoteric doctrines to outsiders. 
</p>

<p>Scholars have revised the conception of a “normative” Pharisaic Judaism dominant in Palestine and a deviant Judaism dominant in the Diaspora. On the one hand, the picture of normative Judaism is broader than at first believed, and it is clear that there were many differences of emphasis within the Pharisaic party. On the other hand, supposed differences between Alexandrian and Palestinian Judaism are not as great as had been formerly thought. In Palestine, no less than in the Diaspora, there were deviations from Pharisaic standards.</p>


-<p>
Despite the attempts of the Pharisaic leaders to restrain the wave of Greek influence, they themselves showed at least superficial Hellenization. In the first place, as many as 2,500 to 3,000 words of Greek origin are found in the Talmudic corpus, and they supply important terms in the fields of law, government, science, religion, technology, and everyday life, especially in the popular sermons preached by the rabbis. When preaching, the Talmudic rabbis often gave the Greek translation of biblical verses for the benefit of those who understood only Greek. The prevalence of Greek in ossuary (burial) inscriptions and the discovery of Greek papyri in the Dead Sea caves confirm the widespread use of Greek, though it seems few Jews really mastered it. Again, there was a superficial Hellenization in the frequent adoption of Greek names, even by the rabbis; and there is evidence (Talmud, 
<e>Soṭa</e>
[a tractate in the Mishna]) of a school at the beginning of the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
that had 500 students of “Greek wisdom.” At the end of the 2nd century, long after the rabbis prohibited the people from teaching their sons Greek (117), Rabbi 
<xref topicid="307183" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625619">Judah ha-Nasi</xref>
(135–220), the editor of the 
<xref topicid="385262" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598084">Mishna</xref>
, the authoritative compilation of the Oral Law, could still remark, “Why talk Syriac in Palestine? Talk either Hebrew or Greek.” The 
<xref topicid="578206" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634989">synagogue</xref>
s of the period are modeled after Hellenistic-Roman basilicas, with inscriptions in Greek and even pagan motifs. Many of the anecdotes told about the rabbis have Socratic and 
<xref topicid="148429" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625622">Cynic</xref>
parallels. There is evidence of discussions between rabbis and Athenians, Alexandrians, Roman philosophers, and even the emperor 
<xref topicid="28784" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625623">Antoninus Pius</xref>
(reigned 138–161); despite all of these discussions, only one rabbi, 
<xref topicid="184754" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625624">Elisha ben Abuyah</xref>
(early 2nd century), appears to have embraced 
<xref topicid="236343" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1625625">gnosticism</xref>
, accepting certain esoteric religious dualistic views. The rabbis never mention the Greek philosophers 
<xref topicid="464109" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598085">Plato</xref>
(428/427–348/347 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) and 
<xref topicid="34560" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598086">Aristotle</xref>
(384–322 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) or the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher 
<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598087">Philo Judaeus</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
15 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–
<e>c.</e>
45 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), and they never use any Greek philosophical terms; the only Greek author whom they name is Homer. Again, the parallels between Hellenistic rhetoric and rabbinic 
<xref topicid="263195" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">hermeneutics</xref>
are in the realm of terminology rather than of substance, and those between Roman and Talmudic law are inconclusive. Part of the explanation of this may be that, although there were 29 Greek cities in Palestine, none was in Judaea, the real stronghold of the Jews.

<xref topicid="265328" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">high priests</xref>
such as Jason and Menelaus, and the institution declined when Herod began the custom of appointing high priests for political and financial considerations. That not only the multitude of Jews but the priesthood itself suffered from sharp divisions is clear from the bitter class warfare that ultimately erupted in 59 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
between the high priests on the one hand and the ordinary priests and the leaders of the populace of Jerusalem on the other.

Although the Temple remained central in Jewish worship, 
<xref topicid="578206" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">synagogues</xref>
had already emerged as places for Torah reading and communal prayer and worship during the Babylonian Exile in the 6th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, if not even earlier. In any case, in the following century 
<xref topicid="199520" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezra</xref>
stood upon a pulpit of wood and read from the Torah to the people (Nehemiah). Some scholars maintain that a 
<xref topicid="578206" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">synagogue</xref>
existed even within the precincts of the Temple; certainly by the time of Jesus, to judge from the references to Galilean synagogues in the Christian Scriptures, synagogues were common in Palestine. Hence, when the Temple was destroyed in 70, the spiritual vacuum was hardly as great as it had been after the destruction of the First Temple (586 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
).

The chief legislative, judicial, and educational body of the Palestinian Jews during the period of the Second Temple was the Great 
<xref topicid="522434" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598089">Sanhedrin</xref>
(council court), consisting of 71 members, among whom the Sadducees were an important party. The members shared the government with the king during the early years of the Hasmonean dynasty, but, beginning with Herod’s reign, their authority was restricted to religious matters. In addition, there seems to have been a Sanhedrin, set up by the high priest, which served as a court of political council, as well as a kind of

During the Hellenistic-Roman period the chief centres of Jewish population outside Palestine were in Syria, 
<xref topicid="22897" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Asia Minor</xref>
, Babylonia, and Egypt, each of which is estimated to have had at least one million Jews. The large Jewish community of Antioch—which, according to Josephus, had been given all the rights of citizenship by the Seleucid founder-king, 
<xref topicid="533305" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634876">Seleucus I Nicator</xref>
(died 280 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
)—attracted a particularly large number of converts to Judaism. In Antioch the apocryphal book of 
<xref topicid="597793" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634881">Tobit</xref>
was probably composed in the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
to encourage wayward Diaspora Jews to return to their Judaism. As for the Jews of Asia Minor, whose large numbers were mentioned by 
<xref topicid="117565" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634882">Cicero</xref>
(106–43 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), their not joining in the Jewish revolts against the Roman emperors

<xref topicid="602150" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635432">Trajan</xref>
(reigned 98–117), and 
<xref topicid="251204" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635434">Hadrian</xref>
(reigned 117–138) would indicate that they had sunk deep roots into their environment. In Babylonia in the early part of the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, two Jewish brothers, Asinaeus and Anilaeus, established an independent minor state; their followers were so meticulous in observing the 
<xref topicid="514970" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sabbath</xref>
that they assumed that it would not be possible to violate it even in order to save themselves from a Parthian attack. In the early 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, according to Josephus, the royal house and many of their entourage in the district of Adiabene in northern Mesopotamia were converted to Judaism; some of the Adiabenian Jews distinguished themselves in the revolt against Rome in 66. 
</p>


-<p>
The largest and most important Jewish settlement in the Diaspora was in 
<xref topicid="180468" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Egypt</xref>
. There is evidence (papyri) of a Jewish military colony at Elephantine (Yeb), 
<xref topicid="618763" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Upper Egypt</xref>
, as early as the 6th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
. These papyri reveal the existence of a Jewish temple—which most certainly would be considered heterodox—and some syncretism (mixture) with pagan cults. Alexandria, the most populous and most influential Hellenistic Jewish community in the Diaspora, originated when Alexander the Great assigned a quarter of the city to the Jews. Until about the 3rd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
the papyri of the Egyptian Jewish community were written in Aramaic; after that, with the exception of the Nash papyrus in Hebrew, all papyri until 400 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
were written in Greek. Similarly, of the 116 Jewish inscriptions from Egypt, all but five are written in Greek. The process of Hellenistic acculturation is thus obvious. 
</p>


-<p>
The most important work of the early Hellenistic period—dating, according to tradition, from the 3rd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
—is the 
<xref topicid="535154" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598090">Septuagint</xref>
, a translation into Greek of the Hebrew Scriptures, including some works not found in the traditional 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew canon</xref>
. The name of the work (from the Latin 
<e>septuaginta</e>
, “70”) derived from the belief that 72 translators, 6 from each of the 12 tribes, worked independently on the entire text and produced identical translations. As revealed in the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="34391" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Letter of Aristeas</xref>

</e>
and the works of Philo and Josephus, the Septuagint was itself regarded by many Hellenized Jews as divinely inspired. The translation shows some knowledge of Palestinian exegesis and the tradition of 
<xref topicid="252201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598110">Halakhah</xref>
(the Oral Law); but the rabbis themselves, noting that the translation diverged from the Hebrew text, apparently had ambivalent feelings about it, as is evidenced in their alternate praise and condemnation of it, as well as in their belief that another translation of the Scriptures into Greek was needed. The fact that “Torah” was translated as 
<e>nomos </e>
(“law”) and 
<e>tzedaqa</e>
as 
<e>dikaiosynē</e>
(“justice”) indicates how deeply the authors of the Septuagint believed that Judaism could be accurately expressed using Greek concepts. 
</p>


-<p>
The fact that the temple at Leontopolis in Egypt was established (
<e>c.</e>
145 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) by a deposed high priest, Onias IV, clearly indicates that it was heterodox; as merely the temple of a military colony, it never really offered a challenge to the Temple in Jerusalem. It is significant that the Palestinian rabbis ruled that a sacrifice intended for the temple of Onias might be offered in Jerusalem. The temple of Onias made little impact upon Egyptian Jewry, as can be seen from the silence about it on the part of Philo, who often mentions the Temple in Jerusalem. The temple of Onias, however, continued until it was closed by the Roman emperor 
<xref topicid="626856" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644754">Vespasian</xref>
(reigned 69–79 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) in 73. 
</p>


-<p>
The chief religious institutions of the Egyptian Diaspora were synagogues. As early as the 3rd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, there were inscriptions mentioning two 
<e>proseuchai</e>
, or Jewish prayer houses. In Alexandria there were numerous synagogues throughout the city, of which the largest was so famous that it is said in the Talmud that he who has not seen it has never seen the glory of Israel.

<headtitle>Egyptian Jewish literature</headtitle>


-<p>
In Egypt the Jews produced a considerable literature (most of it now lost), intended to inculcate in Greek-speaking Jews a pride in their past and to counteract a sense of inferiority that some of them felt about Jewish cultural achievements. In the field of history, Demetrius near the end of the 3rd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
wrote a work titled 
<e>On the Kings in Judaea</e>
; perhaps intended to refute an anti-Semitic Egyptian priest and author, it shows considerable concern for chronology. In the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
a Jew who used the name Hecataeus wrote 
<e>On the Jews</e>
. Another, Eupolemus (
<e>c.</e>
150 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), like Demetrius, wrote a work titled 
<e>On the Kings in Judaea</e>
; an indication of its apologetic nature may be seen from the fragment asserting that Moses taught the alphabet not only to the Jews but also to the Phoenicians and to the Greeks. Artapanus (
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), in his own book 
<e>On the Jews</e>
, went even further in romanticizing Moses—by identifying him with Musaeus, the semi-mythical Greek poet, and 
<xref topicid="593453" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634992">Thoth</xref>
, the Egyptian god of writing and culture, by asserting that Moses was the real originator of Egyptian civilization, and by claiming that Moses taught the Egyptians the worship of 
<xref topicid="29660" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634991">Apis</xref>
(the sacred bull) and the ibis (sacred bird). Cleodemus (Malchus), in an attempt to win for the Jews the regard of the Greeks, asserted in his history that two sons of Abraham had joined Heracles in his expedition in Africa and that the Greek hero had married the daughter of one of them. On the other hand, Jason of Cyrene (
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) wrote a history, of which 2 
<xref topicid="353838" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Maccabees</xref>
is a summary, glorifying the Temple and violently attacking the Jewish Hellenizers, but his manner of writing history is typically Hellenistic. In addition, 3 Maccabees (1st century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) is a work of propaganda intended to counteract those Jews who sought to win citizenship in Alexandria. The 

-<e>

<xref topicid="34391" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Letter of Aristeas</xref>

</e>
, though ascribed to the Egyptian king 
<xref topicid="482146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644761">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</xref>
(308–246 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), was probably composed by an Alexandrian Jew about 100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
to defend Judaism and its practices against detractors. 
</p>


-<p>
Egyptian Jews also composed poems and plays, now extant only in fragments, to glorify their history. Philo the Elder (
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) wrote an epic, 
<e>On Jerusalem</e>
, in Homeric hexameters. Theodotus (
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) also wrote an epic, 
<e>On Shechem</e>
; it was quite clearly apologetic, to judge from the fragment connecting the name of Shechem with Sikimios, the son of the Greek god Hermes. At about the same time, a Jewish poet wrote a didactic poem, ascribing it to the pagan Phocylides, though closely following the Bible in some details; the author disguised his Jewish origin by omitting any attack against idolatry from his moralizing. A collection known as 

-<e>
The 
<xref topicid="542708" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sibylline Oracles</xref>

</e>
, containing Jewish and Christian prophecies in pagan disguise, includes some material composed by a 2nd-century-
<e ty="s">bce</e>
Alexandrian Jew who intended to glorify pious Jews and perhaps win converts. 
</p>


-<p>
A Jewish dramatist of the period, Ezekiel (
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), composed tragedies in Greek. Fragments of one of them, 
<e>The Exodus</e>
, show how deeply he was influenced by the Greek dramatist 
<xref topicid="195618" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598118">Euripides</xref>
(484–406 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Whether or not such plays were actually presented on the stage, they edified Jews and showed pagans that the Jews had as much material for drama as they did. 
</p>


-<p>
The greatest achievements of Alexandrian Judaism were in the realm of wisdom literature and 
<xref topicid="456811" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">philosophy</xref>
. In a work on the analogical interpretation of the Law of Moses, 
<xref topicid="34428" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635425">Aristobulus of Paneas</xref>
(2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) anticipated Philo in attempting to harmonize Greek philosophy and the Torah. He used allegory to explain anthropomorphisms in the Bible and asserted that the Greek philosophers were indebted to Moses. The 
<xref topicid="553548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644762">Wisdom of Solomon</xref>
, dating from the 1st century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, shows an acquaintance with the Platonic doctrine of the preexistence of the soul and with a method of argument known as 
<xref topicid="554926" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634993">sorites</xref>
, which was favoured by the Stoics (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="566892" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1634995">Stoicism</xref>
). During the same period, the author of 4 Maccabees showed an intimate knowledge of Greek 
<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">philosophy</xref>
, particularly of Stoicism. 
</p>


-<p>
By far the greatest figure in Alexandrian Jewish literature is Philo, who has come to be recognized as the first Jewish theologian. His use of Greek philosophy, particularly that of 
<xref topicid="464109" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Plato</xref>
, to explicate the ideas of the Torah and his formulation of the 
<xref topicid="346460" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598120">Logos</xref>
(Word, or Divine Reason) as an intermediary between God and the world helped lay the foundations of 
<xref topicid="409036" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598121">Neoplatonism</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="236343" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">gnosticism</xref>
, and the philosophical outlook of the early 
<xref topicid="117198" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Church Fathers</xref>
. Philo was a devotee of Judaism neither as a mystic cult nor as a collateral branch of Pharisaic Judaism. With his profound knowledge of 
<xref topicid="244649" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Greek literature</xref>
—and despite his almost total ignorance of Hebrew—he tried to find a way in which Judaism could appropriate Hellenic thought. 
</p>


-<p>
There was also a Jewish community in Rome, which numbered perhaps 50,000. To judge from the inscriptions in the Jewish catacombs, it was predominantly Greek-speaking. References by Roman writers, particularly 
<xref topicid="579997" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598124">Tacitus</xref>
(56–120 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) and the satirists, have led scholars to conclude that the community was influential, that it observed the Sabbath and the 
<xref topicid="162787" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">dietary laws</xref>
, and that it actively sought converts. 
</p>


-<p>
The Hellenization of the Diaspora Jews is reflected not merely in their literature but even more in various papyri and art objects. As early as 290 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, Hecataeus of Abdera, a Greek living in Egypt, had remarked that under the Persians and Macedonians the Jews had greatly modified the traditions of their fathers. Other papyri indicate that at least three-fourths of Egyptian Jews had personal names of Greek rather than Hebrew origin. The only schools mentioned are Sabbath schools intended for adults; this suggests that Jews were extremely eager to gain admittance for their children to Greek 
<e>gymnasia</e>
, where quite obviously they would have had to make compromises with their Judaism. Again, there are a number of violations from the norms of Halakha (which precluded the charging of interest for a loan): most notably, 9 of 11 extant loan documents charge interest. There are often striking similarities between Jewish and Greek documents of sale, marriage, and divorce in Egypt, though some of this—as with the documents of the Elephantine Jewish community—may be due to a common origin in the law of ancient Mesopotamia. The charms and apotropaic amulets are often syncretistic, and the Jews can hardly have been unaware of the religious significance of symbols that were still very much filled with meaning in pagan cults. The fact that the Jewish community of Alexandria was preoccupied in the 1st century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
and the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
with obtaining rights as citizens—which certainly involved compromises with Judaism, including participation in pagan festivals and sacrifices—shows how far they were ready to deviate from earlier norms. Philo mentions Jews who scoffed at the Bible, which they insisted on interpreting literally, and others who failed to adhere to biblical laws that they regarded as mere allegory; he writes too of Jews who observed nothing of Judaism except the holiday of 
<xref topicid="653569" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644795">Yom Kippur</xref>
. But despite such deviations, pagan writers constantly accused the Diaspora Jews of being “haters of mankind” and of being absurdly superstitious. Christian writers later similarly attacked the Jews for refusing to give up the Torah. The Jews of Egypt were at least loyal in their contributions of the Temple tax and in their pilgrimages to Jerusalem on the three festivals. Virulent 
<xref topicid="27646" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">anti-Semitism</xref>
and massacres perpetrated by non-Jews in Egypt apparently discouraged actual apostasy and intermarriage, which were not common.

<headtitle>Palestinian literature</headtitle>


-<p>
During this period, literature was composed in Palestine in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek; the original language of many of these texts remains disputed by scholars, and the works that have survived were apparently composed by more than one author over a considerable period of time. Of the works originally composed in Hebrew, many—including 
<xref topicid="177810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644766">Ecclesiasticus</xref>
, 1 Maccabees, 
<xref topicid="307589" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644767">Judith</xref>

, 
<xref topicid="553532" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644764">Psalms of Solomon</xref>
—existed only in Greek during the remainder of the Hellenistic period. They and many of the Dead Sea Scrolls are generally conscious imitations of biblical books, often reflecting the dramatic events of the Maccabean struggle and often tinged with apocalyptic themes (involving the dramatic intervention of God in history). The literature in Aramaic consists of biblical or Bible-like legends or Midrashic (interpretive) additions (Testament of Job, Martyrdom of Isaiah [

(both are lost) and, by Josephus, 
<e>History of the Jewish War</e>

<e>Jewish Antiquities</e>
(both written in Rome). 
</p>


-<p>
Of the wisdom literature composed in Hebrew, the book of the 
<xref topicid="177810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach</xref>
, or 
<xref topicid="177810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ecclesiasticus</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
180–175 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), modeled on the book of Proverbs, identified Wisdom with the observance of the Torah. The 
<xref topicid="610927" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644798">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</xref>
, probably written in the latter half of the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, patterned on Jacob’s blessings to his sons, is thought to belong to eschatological literature related to the Dead Sea Scrolls. The identification of Wisdom and Torah is stressed in the Mishnaic tract 
<e>Pirqe Avot</e>
(“Sayings of the Fathers”), which, though edited about 200 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, contains the aphorisms of rabbis dating back to 300 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
. 
</p>


-<p>
Books such as the Testament of Job, Genesis Apocryphon, the 
<xref topicid="307075" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644778">Book of Jubilees</xref>
(now known to have been composed in Hebrew, as seen by its appearance among the Dead Sea Scrolls), and 
<e>Biblical Antiquities</e>
(falsely attributed to Philo; originally written in Hebrew, then translated into Greek, but now extant only in Latin), as well as the first half of Josephus’s 
<e>Jewish Antiquities</e>
, often show affinities with rabbinic Midrashim (interpretive works) in their legendary accretions of biblical details. Sometimes, as in Jubilees and in the Pseudo-Philo work, these accretions are intended to answer the questions of heretics, but often, particularly in the case of Josephus, they are apologetic in presenting biblical heroes in a guise that would appeal to a Hellenized audience. 
</p>


-<p>
Apocalyptic trends, given considerable impetus by the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian Greeks, were not (as was formerly thought) restricted to Pharisaic circles. They were (as is clear from the Dead Sea Scrolls) found in other groups as well and are of particular importance for their influence on both Jewish 
<xref topicid="400861" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650344">mysticism</xref>
and early Christianity. These books, which have a close connection with the biblical Book of Daniel, stress the impossibility of a rational solution to the problem of theodicy. They also stress the imminence of the day of salvation, which is to be preceded by terrible hardships, and presumably reflected the current historical setting. In the First Book of Enoch there is stress on the terrible punishment inflicted upon sinners in the 
<xref topicid="331102" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Last Judgment</xref>
, the imminent coming of the messiah and his kingdom, and the role of angels.

The sole Palestinian Jewish author writing in Greek whose works are preserved is 
<xref topicid="306479" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Josephus</xref>
. His account of the war against the Romans in his

Under Roman rule a number of new groups, largely political, emerged in Palestine. Their common aim was to seek an independent Jewish state. They were also zealous for, and strict in their observance of, the Torah. 
</p>


-<p>
After the death of King Herod, a political group known as the 
<xref topicid="263495" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Herodians</xref>
, who apparently regarded Herod as the messiah, sought to reestablish the rule of Herod’s descendants over an independent Palestine as a prerequisite for Jewish preservation. Unlike the 
<xref topicid="656131" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598155">Zealots</xref>
, however, they did not refuse to pay taxes to the Romans. 
</p>


-<p>
The Zealots, whose appearance was traditionally dated to 6 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, were one of five groups that emerged at the outset of the first Jewish war against Rome (66–73 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), which began when the Jews expelled the Romans from Jerusalem, the client king 
<xref topicid="263463" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Agrippa II</xref>
fled the city, and a revolutionary government was established. The Zealots were a mixture of bandits, insurgents from Jerusalem, and priests, who advocated egalitarianism and independence from Rome. In 68 they overthrew the government established by the original leaders of the revolt and took control of the Temple during the civil war that followed; many of them perished in the sack of Jerusalem by the Roman general (and later emperor) 
<xref topicid="597352" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644852">Titus</xref>
(reigned 79–81) or in fighting after the city’s fall. The Sicarii (Assassins), so-called because of the daggers (
<e>sica</e>
) they carried, arose about 54 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, according to Josephus, as a group of bandits who kidnapped or murdered those who had found a modus vivendi with the Romans. It was they who made a stand at the fortress of 
<xref topicid="367687" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598158">Masada</xref>
, near the Dead Sea, committing suicide rather than allowing themselves to be captured by the Romans (73).

A number of other parties—various types of 
<xref topicid="193097" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598159">Essenes</xref>
, Damascus covenanters, and the Qumrān–Dead Sea groups—were distinguished by their pursuit of an ascetic monastic life, disdain for material goods and sensual gratification, sharing of material possessions, concern for eschatology, strong apocalyptic views in anticipation of the coming of the messiah, practice of ablutions to attain greater sexual and 
<xref topicid="504688" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ritual</xref>
purity, prayer, contemplation, and study. The 
<xref topicid="193097" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Essenes</xref>
differed from the 
<xref topicid="591173" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635409">Therapeutae</xref>
, a Jewish religious group that had flourished in Egypt two centuries earlier, in that the latter actively sought “wisdom” whereas the former were anti-intellectual. Only some of the Essenes were celibate. The Essenes have been termed “gnosticizing Pharisees” because of their belief, shared with the gnostics, that the world of matter is evil. 
</p>


-<p>
The Damascus sect (New Covenanters) was a group of Pharisees who went beyond the letter of the Pharisaic Halakha. Like the Essenes and the 
<xref topicid="154274" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Dead Sea</xref>
sects, they adopted a monastic lifestyle and opposed the way in which sacrifices were offered in the Temple.

The discoveries of scrolls in the caves of Qumrān, near the Dead Sea, beginning in 1947, focused attention on the groups that had lived there. On the basis of paleography, carbon-14 testing, and the coins discovered in the caves, most scholars accept a 1st-century date for them. A theoretical relationship of the communities with 
<xref topicid="305173" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635414">John the Baptist</xref>
and the nascent Christian groups remains in dispute, however. The sectaries have been identified variously as Zealots, an unnamed anti-Roman group, and especially Essenes. That the groups had secret, presumably apocalyptic teachings is clear from the fact that some of the scrolls are in cryptographic script and reversed writing; yet, despite the sectaries’ extreme piety and legalistic conservatism, they apparently were not unaware of Hellenism, to judge from the presence of Greek books at Qumrān.

-<p>
It has long been debated whether 
<xref topicid="236343" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">gnosticism</xref>
originated in the apocalyptic strains of Judaism that were prevalent when the Temple was destroyed in 70. Although it is doubtful that there is any direct Jewish source of gnosticism, some characteristic gnostic doctrines are found in certain groups of particularly apocalyptic 1st-century Jews—the dichotomy of body and soul and a disdain for the material world, a notion of esoteric knowledge, and an intense interest in angels and in problems of creation.

Origin of 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christianity:</xref>
the early Christians and the Jewish community 
</headtitle>


-<p>
Although it attracted little attention among pagans and Jews in its early years, the rise of Christianity was by far the most important “sectarian” development of the Roman period. Largely owing to the discoveries at Qumrān, many scholars now regard primitive Christianity, with its apocalyptic and eschatological interests, as part of a broad spectrum of attitudes within Judaism itself, rather than as peripheral to Jewish development or to the norm set by Pharisaic Judaism. Indeed, 
<xref topicid="303091" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jesus</xref>
himself may now be classified as an apocalyptic prophet whose announced intentions were not to abrogate the Torah but to fulfill it. It is possible to envision a direct line between Jewish currents, both in Palestine and the Diaspora in the Hellenistic Age, and Christianity—particularly in the traditions of martyrdom, proselytism, 
<xref topicid="388935" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">monasticism</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="400861" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">mysticism</xref>
, liturgy, and theology and especially with the doctrine of the Logos (Word) as an intermediary between God and the world and as the connection of faith and reason. The 
<xref topicid="535154" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Septuagint</xref>
in particular played an important role both theoretically, in the transformation of Greek philosophy into the theology of the Church Fathers, and practically, in converting Jews and Jewish “sympathizers” to Christianity. In general, moreover, Christianity was more positively disposed toward Hellenism than was Pharisaism, particularly under the leadership of 
<xref topicid="447019" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Paul</xref>
, a thoroughly Hellenized Jew. 
</p>


-<p>
Even after Paul proclaimed his opposition to observance of the Torah as a means of salvation, many Jewish Christians continued the practice. Among them were two main groups: the 
<xref topicid="177608" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598162">Ebionites</xref>
—probably the people called 
<e>minim</e>
, or “sectaries,” in the Talmud—who accepted Jesus as the messiah but denied his divinity; and the 
<xref topicid="407146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Nazarenes</xref>
, who regarded Jesus as both messiah and God yet still regarded the Torah as binding upon Jews. 
</p>

<p>The number of Jews converted to any form of Christianity was extremely small, as can be seen from the frequent criticisms of Jews for their stubbornness by Christian writers. In the Diaspora, despite the strong influence of Hellenism, there were relatively few Jewish converts, though the Christian movement had some success in winning over Alexandrian Jews.</p>


-<p>
There were four major stages in the final break between Christianity and Judaism: (1) the flight of the Jewish Christians from Jerusalem to Pella across the Jordan in 70 and their refusal to continue the struggle against the Romans, (2) the institution by the patriarch 
<xref topicid="224735" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635424">Gamaliel II</xref>
of a prayer in the Eighteen Benedictions against such heretics (
<e>c.</e>
100), and (3 and 4) the failure of the Christians to join the messianic leaders Lukuas-Andreas and 
<xref topicid="52477" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598163">Bar Kokhba</xref>
in the revolts against Trajan and Hadrian in 115–117 and 132–135, respectively.

When Pompey entered the Temple in 63 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
as an arbiter both in the civil war between John Hyrcanus and Aristobulus I and in the struggle of the Pharisees against both Jewish rulers, Judaea in effect became a puppet state of the Romans. During the civil war between Pompey and 
<xref topicid="88114" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635426">Julius Caesar</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>

), the Idumaean 
<xref topicid="28446" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Antipater</xref>
(died 43 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) ingratiated himself with Caesar and was rewarded by being made governor of Judaea; the Jews were rewarded through the promulgation of a number of decrees favourable to them, which were reaffirmed by 
<xref topicid="43047" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635427">Augustus</xref>
(reigned 27 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–14 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) and later emperors. Antipater’s son 
<xref topicid="263437" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Herod</xref>
, king of Judaea, an admirer of Greek culture, supported a cult worshipping the emperor and built temples to Augustus in non-Jewish cities. Because he was by origin an Idumaean, he was regarded by many Jews as a foreigner. (The Idumaeans, or Edomites, had been forcibly converted to Judaism by 
<xref topicid="305011" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">John Hyrcanus</xref>
.) On several occasions during and after Herod’s reign, Pharisaic delegations sought to convince the Romans to end the quasi-independent Jewish government. After the death of Herod’s son and successor, Archelaus, in 6 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, Herod’s realms were ruled by Roman procurators, the most famous (or infamous) of whom, 
<xref topicid="460341" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635428">Pontius Pilate</xref>
(died 36), attempted to introduce busts of the Roman emperor into Jerusalem and discovered the intense religious zeal of the Jews in opposing this measure. When the emperor 
<xref topicid="89691" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635429">Caligula</xref>
(reigned 37–41) ordered that a statue of himself be erected in the Temple, a large number of Jews proclaimed that they would suffer death rather than permit such a desecration. In response, the governor of Syria, Petronius, succeeded in getting the emperor to delay. The procurators of Judaea, being of equestrian (knightly) rank and often of Oriental Greek stock, were more anti-Jewish than the governors of Syria, who were of the higher senatorial order. The last procurators in particular were indifferent to Jewish religious sensibilities; and various patriotic groups, to whom nationalism was an integral part of their religion, succeeded in polarizing the Jewish population and bringing on the first war with Rome in 66. The climax of the war, as noted earlier, was the destruction of the Temple in 70, though, according to 
<xref topicid="306479" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Josephus</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="597352" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Titus</xref>
sought to spare it.

The papyri indicate that the war against 
<xref topicid="602150" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Trajan</xref>
—involving the Jews of Egypt, Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia (though only to a minor degree those of Palestine)—was a widespread revolt under a Cyrenian king-messiah, Lukuas-Andreas, aimed at freeing Palestine from Roman rule. In 132–135 the same spirit of freedom inspired another uprising, the

<xref topicid="11606" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598185">Akiba ben Joseph</xref>
(40–

(reigned 138–161). Having suffered such tremendous losses on the field of battle, Judaism turned its dynamism to the continued development of the Talmud.

After the defeat of 
<xref topicid="52477" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Bar Kokhba</xref>
and the ensuing collapse of active Jewish resistance to Roman rule (135–136), politically moderate and quietist rabbinic elements remained the only cohesive group in Jewish society. With Jerusalem off-limits to the Jews, rabbinic ideology and practice, which were not dependent on the Temple, priesthood, or political independence for their vitality, provided a viable program for autonomous community life and thus filled the vacuum created by the suppression of all other Jewish leadership. The Romans, confident that the will for insurrection had been shattered, soon relaxed the Hadrianic prohibitions of Jewish 
<xref topicid="431536" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ordination</xref>
, public assembly, and regulation of the calendar and permitted rabbis who had fled the country to return and reestablish an academy in the town of Usha in Galilee. 
</p>


-<p>
The strength of the rabbinate lay in its ability to represent simultaneously the interests of the Jews and the Romans, whose religious and political needs, respectively, now chanced to coincide. The rabbis were regarded favourably by the Romans as a politically submissive class, which, with its wide influence over the Jewish masses, could translate the 
<xref topicid="447447" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Pax Romana</xref>
(the peace imposed by Roman rule) into Jewish religious precepts. To the Jews, on the other hand, the rabbinic ideology gave the appearance of continuity to Jewish self-rule and freedom from alien interference. The rabbinic program fashioned by 
<xref topicid="304443" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Johanan ben Zakkai</xref>
and his circle replaced sacrifice and pilgrimage to the Temple with the study of Scripture, prayer, and works of piety, thus eliminating the need for a central sanctuary (in Jerusalem) and making Judaism a religion capable of practice anywhere. Judaism was now, for all intents and purposes, a Diaspora religion, even on its home soil. Any sense of real break with the past was mitigated by continued adherence to purity laws (dietary and bodily) and by assiduous study of Scripture, including the legal elements that historical developments had now made inoperable. The reward held out for scrupulous study and fulfillment was the promise of messianic deliverance—i.e., the divine restoration of all those institutions that had become central in Jewish notions of national independence, including the Davidic monarchy, Temple service, and the ingathering of Diaspora Jewry. Above all these rewards was the assurance of personal resurrection and participation in the national rebirth. 
</p>


-<p>
Apart from the right to teach Scripture publicly, the most pressing need felt by the surviving rabbis was for the reorganization of a body that would revive the functions of the former Sanhedrin and pass judgment on disputed questions of law and dogma. Accordingly, a high court was organized under the leadership of Simeon ben Gamaliel (reigned 
<e>c.</e>
135–
<e>c.</e>
175), the son of the previous patriarch (the Roman term for the head of the Palestinian Jewish community) of the house of 
<xref topicid="265877" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hillel</xref>
, in association with rabbis representing other schools and interests. In the ensuing struggle for power, Gamaliel managed to concentrate all communal authority in his office. The reign of Gamaliel’s son and successor, 
<xref topicid="307183" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Judah the Prince</xref>
, marked the climax of this period of rabbinic activity, otherwise known as the “age of the 
<e>tannaim</e>
” (teachers). Armed with wealth, Roman backing, and dynastic legitimacy (which the patriarch now traced to the house of David), Judah sought to standardize Jewish practice through a corpus of legal norms that would reflect accepted views of the rabbinate on every aspect of life. The 
<xref topicid="385262" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mishna</xref>
that soon emerged became the primary reference work in all rabbinic schools and constituted the core around which the Talmud was later compiled (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635487">Talmud and Midrash</xref>
). It thus remains the best single introduction to the complex of rabbinic values and practices as they evolved in Roman Palestine.

</headtitle>


-<p>
Although the promulgation of an official corpus represented a break with rabbinic precedent, Judah’s Mishna did have antecedents. During the 1st and 2nd centuries 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, rabbinic schools had compiled for their own use collections of Midrashim (singular 
<xref topicid="381628" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Midrash</xref>
, meaning “investigation” or “interpretation”), in which the results of their exegesis and application of Scripture to problematic situations were recorded in terse legal form. By 200 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
several such compilations were circulating in Jewish schools and were being utilized by judges. While adhering to the structural form of these earlier collections, Judah compiled a new one in which universally accepted views were recorded alongside those still in dispute, thereby largely reducing the margin for individual discretion in the interpretation of the law. Although his action aroused opposition and some rabbis continued to invoke their own collections, the authority of his office and the obvious advantages of a unified system of law soon outweighed centrifugal tendencies, and his Mishna attained quasi-canonical status, becoming known as “The Mishna” or “Our Mishna.” Yet, for all its clarity and comprehensiveness, its phraseology was often obscure or too terse to satisfy all needs, and a companion work known as the 
<xref topicid="600346" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598189">Tosefta</xref>
(“Additions”), in which omitted traditions and explanatory notes were recorded, was compiled shortly thereafter. Neither compilation elucidated the processes by which decisions had been elicited, and various authorities therefore set about collecting the Midrashic discussions of their schools and recording them in the order of the verses of Scripture. During the 3rd and 4th centuries, Midrashim on the Pentateuch were compiled and introduced as school texts. 
</p>


-<p>
Fundamentally legal in character, this literature regulated every aspect of life; the six divisions of the Mishna—on agriculture, festivals, family life, civil law, sacrificial and 
<xref topicid="162787" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">dietary laws</xref>
, and purity—encompass virtually every area of Jewish experience. Accordingly, the Mishna also recorded the principal Pharisaic and rabbinic definitions and goals of the religious life. One tract, 
<e>Pirqe Avot</e>
(“Sayings of the Fathers”), treated the meaning and posture of a life according to the Torah, while other passages made reference to the mystical studies into which only the most advanced and religiously worthy were initiated—e.g., the activities of the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="376144" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Merkava</xref>

</e>
, or divine “Chariot,” and the doctrines of creation. The rabbinic program of a life dedicated to study and fulfillment of the will of God was thus a graded structure in which the canons of morality and piety were attainable on various levels, from the popular and practical to the esoteric and metaphysical. Innumerable sermons and homilies preserved in the Midrashic collections, liturgical compositions for daily and festival services, and mystical tracts circulated among initiates all testify to the deep spirituality that informed Rabbinic Judaism.

-<p>
The promulgation of the Mishna initiated the period of the 
<e>amoraim</e>
(lecturers or interpreters), teachers who made the Mishna the basic text of legal exegesis. The curriculum now centred on the elucidation of the text of the standard compilation, harmonization of its decisions with extra-Mishnaic traditions recorded in other collections, and the application of its principles to new situations. Amoraic studies have been preserved in two running commentaries on the Mishna, known as the 
<xref topicid="439785" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Palestinian</xref>
(or Jerusalem) Talmud and the 
<xref topicid="47713" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Talmud</xref>
, reflecting the study and legislation of the academies of the two principal Jewish centres in the Roman and Persian empires. (Talmud is also the comprehensive term for the whole collections, Palestinian and Babylonian, containing Mishna, commentaries, and other matter.) 
</p>


-<p>
The schools were the primary agencies through which the rabbinic way of life and literature was communicated to the masses. The types of schools ranged from the 
<xref topicid="476208" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">primary school</xref>
to the advanced “house of study” and more formal academy (
<xref topicid="653077" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1605702">yeshiva</xref>
), the synagogue, and the Jewish court. Primary schools had long been available in the villages and cities of Palestine, and tannaitic law made education of male children a religious duty. Introduced at the age of five or six to Scripture, the student advanced at the age of 10 to Mishna and finally in midadolescence to Talmud, or the processes of legal reasoning. Regular reading of Scripture in the synagogue on Mondays, Thursdays, Sabbaths, and festivals, coupled with concurrent translations into the Aramaic vernacular and frequent sermons, provided for lifelong instruction in the literature and the various teachings elicited from it. The amoraic emphasis on the moral and spiritual aims of Scripture and its ritual is reflected in their Midrashic collections, which are predominantly homileticalrather than legal in character. 
</p>


-<p>
An amoraic sermon conceded that, of every 1,000 beginners in primary school, only one would be expected to continue as far as Talmud. In the 4th century, however, there were enough advanced students to warrant academies in Lydda, Caesarea, Sepphoris, and Tiberias (in Palestine), where leading scholars trained disciples for communal service as teachers and judges. In 
<xref topicid="88235" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Caesarea</xref>
—the principal port and seat of the Roman administration of Palestine, where pagans, Christians, and Samaritans maintained renowned cultural institutions—the Jews too established an academy that was singularly free of patriarchal control. The outstanding rabbinic scholar there, Abbahu (
<e>c.</e>
279–320), wielded great influence with the Roman authorities. Because he combined learning with personal wealth and political power, he attracted some of the most gifted students of the day to the city. About 350 the studies and decisions of the authorities in Caesarea were compiled as a tract on the civil law of the Mishna. Half a century later, the academy of Tiberias issued a similar collection on other tracts of the Mishna, and this compilation, in conjunction with the Caesarean material, constituted the 
<xref topicid="439785" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Palestinian Talmud</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
Despite increasing tensions between some rabbinic circles and the patriarch, his office was the agency that provided a basic unity to the Jews of the 
<xref topicid="507739" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Roman Empire</xref>
. Officially recognized as a Roman prefect, the patriarch at the same time sent representatives to Jewish communities to inform them of the 
<xref topicid="303554" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jewish calendar</xref>
and other decisions of general concern and to collect an annual tax of a half shekel, paid by male Jews for his treasury. As titular head of the Jewish community of Palestine and as a vestigial heir of the Davidic monarchy, the patriarch was a reminder of a glorious past and a symbol of hope for a brighter future. How enduring these hopes were may be seen from the efforts to gain permission to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. Although reconstruction of the Temple was authorized by the emperor 
<xref topicid="307781" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635525">Julian</xref>
(reigned 361–363), it came to naught because of a disastrous fire on the sacred site and the emperor’s subsequent death. 
</p>


-<p>
The adoption of 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christianity</xref>
as the religion of the empire had no direct effect on the religious freedom of the Jews. The ever-mounting hostility between the two religions, however, resulted in severe curtailment of Jewish disciplinary rights over their coreligionists, interference in the collection of patriarchal taxes, restriction of the right to build synagogues, and, finally, upon the death of the patriarch Gamaliel VI about 425, the abolition of the patriarchate and the diversion of the Jewish tax to the imperial treasury. Mediterranean Jewry was now fragmented into disjointed communities and synagogues. But the principles of the regulation of the Jewish calendar had been committed to writing in approximately 359 by the patriarch Hillel II, and this, coupled with the widespread presence of rabbis, ensured the continuity of Jewish adherence. Even the restrictions on synagogal worship and preaching imposed by the Eastern emperor

(200–650) 
</headtitle>


-<p>
In the increasingly unfriendly climate of Christendom, Jews were consoled by the knowledge that in nearby Babylonia (then under Persian rule) a vast population of Jews lived under a network of effective and autonomous Jewish institutions and officials. Steadily worsening conditions in Palestine drew many Jews to Persian domains, where economic opportunities and the Jewish communal structure enabled them to gain a better livelihood while living in accordance with their ancestral traditions. To regulate internal Jewish affairs and ensure the steady flow of taxes, the Parthian, or Arsacid, rulers (247 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–224 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) had appointed in approximately 100 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
an exilarch, or “head of the [Jews in] exile”—who claimed more direct Davidic descent than the Palestinian patriarch—to rule over the Jews as a quasi-prince. About 220, two Babylonian disciples of 
<xref topicid="307183" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Judah ha-Nasi</xref>
, Abba Arika (known as Rav) and Samuel bar Abba, began to propagate the Mishna and related tannaitic literature as normative standards. As heads of the academies at Sura and Nehardea, respectively, Rav and Samuel cultivated a native Babylonian rabbinate, which increasingly provided the manpower for local Jewish courts and other communal services. While the usual tensions between temporal and religious arms frequently existed in Babylonia, the symbiosis of exilarchate and rabbinate endured until the middle of the 11th century. 
</p>


-<p>
Paradoxically, Babylonian rabbinism derived its theological and political strength from its fundamentally unoriginal character. As a transplant of Palestinian Judaism, it asserted its historical legitimacy to the 
<xref topicid="524652" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1644875">Sāsānian dynasty</xref>
(224–651), who protected Jewish practices against interference from fanatical Magian priests, and to native Jewish officials, who argued for the validity of indigenous Babylonian deviations from Palestinian norms. But ultimately the historical importance of this transplantation lay in Babylonia’s serving as the 
<xref topicid="480711" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">proving ground</xref>
for the adaptability of Palestinian Judaism to a Diaspora situation. Legal and theological adaptations generated by the new locale and the needs of the times inevitably produced changes in the religious tradition. The laws of agriculture, purity, and sacrifices all of necessity fell into disuse. The principles embodied in these laws, however, and the core of the legal and theological system—consisting of faith in the revelation and election of Israel, the requirement that the individual live by the canons of Jewish civil and 
<xref topicid="201326" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">family law</xref>
, and the network of communal institutions modeled on those of Palestinian Judaism—remained intact, thereby ensuring a basic continuity and uniformity among rabbinically oriented communities everywhere. Because historical circumstances made Babylonia the mediator of this tradition to all Jewish communities in the High 
<xref topicid="380873" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle Ages</xref>
(9th–12th centuries), the Babylonian version of Jewish religion became synonymous with normative Judaism and the measure of Judaic authenticity everywhere. 
</p>


-<p>
“The law of the [Gentile] government is binding”—the principle formulated by Samuel (died 254), head of the academy at Nehardea—summarizes the essential novelty in rabbinic reorientation to life on foreign soil. Whereas Palestinian rabbis had complied with imperial decrees of taxation as legitimate de facto—and this was all that Samuel had in mind—Babylonian teachers now rationalized governmental authority in this respect as legitimate de jure, thus enjoining upon the Jews political quietism and submissiveness as part of their 
<xref topicid="167440" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">religious doctrine</xref>
. In all other areas of civil law, the Jews were instructed by their rabbis to file suit in Jewish courts and thus to conduct their businesses as well as their family lives by rabbinic law. 
</p>


-<p>
While the rabbis could impose their discipline more effectively in matters of public law than in private religious practice, the density of the Jewish population in many areas of Parthia (northeastern Iran) and Babylonia facilitated the application of moral and disciplinary pressures. The most effective vehicle for the dissemination of their teachings was the academies, where judges and communal teachers were trained; among these institutions, those of Sura and Pumbedita remained preeminent. Frequent public lectures in the synagogues of the academies on Sabbaths and festivals were capped by public 
<e>kalla</e>
(study-course) assemblies for alumni of the schools during the two months, Adar (February–March) and Elul (August–September), when the lull in agricultural work freed many to attend semiannual refresher instruction. These meetings were followed by regular popular lectures during the festival seasons that soon followed. Thus, while rabbis constituted a distinct class within the community, their efforts were oriented toward making as much of the community as possible members of a learned and religious elite. The harmonious relations that obtained with but few interruptions over the centuries between the Sāsānian rulers and their Jewish subjects gave the Jewish population the air of a quasi-state, which the Jewish leadership frequently extolled as superior to the Jewish community of Palestine. 
</p>


-<p>
The dissemination of the Palestinian Talmud probably stimulated the Babylonians to follow suit by collecting and arranging the records of study and decisions of their own academies and courts. The Babylonian Talmud, which apparently underwent several stages of redaction (
<e>c.</e>
500–650) on the basis of the proto-Talmuds—the early collections of commentaries on the Mishna used in the academies—accordingly became the standard of reference for judicial precedent and theological doctrine for all of Babylonian Jewry and all those communities under its influence. Some scholars have postulated a group of anonymous editors of these earlier materials, calling them 
<e>stammaim</e>
(“anonymous ones”). As had been the case with the Mishna, the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud was later designated by authorities as marking the end of a period in Jewish history. The scholars who added the finishing stylistic touches, known as 

-<e>

<xref topicid="525833" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">savoraʾim</xref>

(“explicators”), were classified as a transitional stage between the

and the 
<e>geonim</e>
.

, especially in the 
<xref topicid="31551" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Arabian Peninsula</xref>
. Proud Jewish tribes living in close proximity to each other in the vicinity of Yathrib (later Medina, Muhammad’s home city) engaged in agriculture and commerce and proclaimed the superiority of their monotheistic ethos and eschatology.

(7th–8th century) created a political framework for the basically uniform (i.e., Babylonian) character of medieval Judaism. As a “people of the Book” (i.e., of the Bible), the Jews were permitted by the Muslims to live under the same autonomous structure that had developed under Arsacid and Sāsānian rule. The heads of the two principal academies were now formally recognized by the exilarch, and through him by the Muslim caliphs (the civil and religious heads of the Muslim state), as the official arbiters of all questions of religious law and as the religious heads of all Jewish communities that came under Muslim sway.

convocations. Under the strong leadership of Yehudai, gaon of Sura (presided 760–763), the Babylonian rabbinate made vigorous efforts to replace Palestinian usage wherever it was still in vogue—including the study of Palestinian amoraic legal literature—with Babylonian practice and texts, thus making the Babylonian Talmud the unrivalled standard of Jewish norms. The campaign’s success is indicated by the usage of the term Talmud, which, when unqualified, has ever since meant the Babylonian Talmud. Indeed, even in Palestine the Babylonian corpus displaced its older rival and caused the study of Palestinian Talmudic literature to be confined to circles of legal specialists.

<headtitle>Anti-rabbinic reactions</headtitle>


-<p>
The firm—and occasionally oppressive—tactics of exilarchs and 
<e>geonim</e>
generated anti-rabbinic reactions in the form of sectarian and messianic revolts, especially in outlying areas where enforcement was difficult. Inspired in part by ancient Palestinian sectarian doctrines and in part by Muslim usage, the sects were by and large quickly and forcefully suppressed. In the 8th century, according to the traditional Rabbinite account, 
<xref topicid="22658" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598201">Anan ben David</xref>
, a disaffected member of the exilarchic family, founded a dissident sect, the Ananites, later known as the 
<xref topicid="311998" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598202">Karaites</xref>
(Scripturalists). The exact relationship between the followers of Anan and the later Karaites, however, remains unclear. The term itself first appeared in the 9th century, when various dissident groups coalesced and ultimately adopted Anan as their founder, though they rejected several of his teachings. The new sect advocated a threefold program of rejection of rabbinic law as a human fabrication and therefore as an unwarranted, unauthoritative addition to Scripture; a return to Palestine to hasten the messianic redemption; and a reexamination of Scripture to retrieve authentic law and doctrine. Under the leadership of Daniel al-Qumisi (
<e>c.</e>
850?), a Karaite settlement prospered in the 
<xref topicid="439645" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holy Land</xref>
, from which it spread as far as northwestern Africa and Christian Spain. A barrage of Karaite treatises presenting new views of scriptural exegesis stimulated renewed study of the Bible and the 
<xref topicid="259061" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew language</xref>
in Rabbinite circles as well. The most momentous consequence of these new studies was the invention of several systems of vocalization for the text of the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
in Babylonia and Tiberias in the 9th and 10th centuries. The annotation of the 
<xref topicid="368081" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Masoretic</xref>
(traditional, or authorized) text of the Bible with vocalic, musical, and grammatical accents in the Tiberian schools of the 10th-century scholars Ben Naftali and Ben Asher fixed the 
<xref topicid="368081" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Masoretic text</xref>
permanently and, through it, the morphology of the 
<xref topicid="259061" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew language</xref>
for Karaites as well as Rabbinites. 
</p>


-<p>
In the face of sectarian challenges, the 
<e>geonim</e>
intensified their efforts against any deviation from Rabbinite norms. They began to issue handbooks of Jewish law that set forth in concise and unequivocal terms the standards for correct practice. A number of these codes, notably the 
<e>Halakhot gedolot</e>
(“Great Laws”), 
<e>Siddur Rav Amram Gaon</e>
(“The 
<xref topicid="128612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Prayer Book</xref>
of Rav Amram Gaon”; on liturgical practice), and 
<e>Sheʾeltot</e>
(“Disquisitions”) by Aḥa of Shabḥa (
<e>c.</e>
680–
<e>c.</e>
752), attained authoritative status in local schools and further unified medieval Judaism. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<e>geonim</e>
, however, were powerless to halt several 
<xref topicid="551304" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">social developments</xref>
in the 9th century that progressively undermined their hold even on Rabbinite communities. A renaissance of Greek philosophy and sciences in Arabic translation, coupled with the progressive urbanization of the upper classes of all religious and 
<xref topicid="194248" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ethnic groups</xref>
in the centres of political, commercial, and cultural activity, generated a new intelligentsia that cut across religious and ethnic lines. Widespread skepticism concerning basic doctrines of faith such as creation, revelation, and retribution was most poignantly represented by latitudinarianism (the tendency to be flexible and tolerant about deviations from 
<xref topicid="433382" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">orthodox</xref>
beliefs and doctrines) and by antinomian gnostic groups that denied divine providence and omniscience (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="28267" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638939">antinomianism</xref>
). Ḥiwi al-Balkhī, a 9th-century skeptical Jewish pamphleteer, scandalized the faithful by openly attacking the morality of Scripture and by issuing for schools an expurgated edition of the Bible that omitted “offensive” material (e.g., alleged stories of God acting dishonestly). A mystifying Hebrew tract titled 

-<xref topicid="532602" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650426">

<e>Sefer yetzira</e>

</xref>
(“Book of Creation”) posited in terse and enigmatic epigrams a novel theory of creation that betrayed Neoplatonic influence. Karaites joined philosophically oriented intellectuals in heaping scorn on popular Rabbinite customs that smacked of superstition and, above all, on Talmudic homilies that referred to God in anthropomorphic terms. 
</p>


-<p>
Gaonic difficulties were compounded by the rise in 
<xref topicid="418538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North Africa</xref>
and Spain of populous and wealthy Jewish communities that, thanks to the development of their own local schools and talent, ignored the Babylonian academies or favoured one over the other with religious queries and, in consequence, with financial contributions. To the delight of dissidents and the chagrin of the faithful, competition between the Babylonian academies turned to internecine hostility. Occasional revolts against exilarchic taxation and administration in outlying areas of Persia had to be quelled with armed force. The Palestinian Rabbinites had revived their own academies, and their presidents now not only appealed for support in other Diaspora lands but challenged the authority of the Babylonians to serve as final arbiters on matters of public import, such as the regulation of the calendar. By 900 the Rabbinite community of Babylonia was in a state of chaos and dissolution.

In a bold effort to restore discipline and respect for the gaonate, the exilarch David ben Zakkai (916/917–940) bypassed the families from whom the

<xref topicid="514809" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598218">Saʿadia ben Joseph</xref>
(882–942) to head the academy of Sura. Of Egyptian birth, Saʿadia had gained wide acclaim for his scholarly retorts to Karaites, heretics, and Palestinian Rabbinites. Politically, Saʿadia’s brief presidency was a fiasco and aggravated the chaos by a communal civil war. His gaonate, however, gave an official stamp to his many works, which responded to the ideological challenges to Rabbinism by restating traditional Judaism in intellectually cogent terms. Saʿadia thus became the pioneer of a Judeo-Arabic culture that would blossom fully in Andalusian Spain a century later. His translation of the Bible into Arabic and his Arabic commentaries on Scripture made the rabbinic understanding of the Bible accessible to masses of Jews. His poetic compositions for liturgical use provided the stimulus for the revival of Hebrew poetry. Above all, his rationalist commentary on the puzzling 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
and his brilliant treatise on philosophical theology, 
<e>The Book of Beliefs and Opinions</e>
, synthesized the 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1740642">Torah</xref>
(understood as the divine law in the

</e>
. His efforts made Judaism philosophically respectable and the study of philosophy a religiously acceptable pursuit. 
</p>


-<p>
Far from tightening the gaonic hold over the Jewish communities of the Arabic world, Saʿadia’s works actually provided the wherewithal for ever-greater intellectual and religious self-sufficiency. While economic, political, and military upheavals progressively weakened various institutions in the Middle East, concurrent prosperity and consolidation in the West stimulated the maturation of indigenous leadership in Egypt, Al-Qayrawān (Kairouan; in present-day Tunisia), and Muslim Spain.

<e>responsa</e>
issued in the course of their successive terms (968–1038) at Pumbedita. Circumstances beyond anyone’s control, however, were gradually undermining the effectiveness of exilarchate and gaonate. But by 1038, the year of Hai’s death, the consequences of four centuries of gaonic activity had become indelible: the Babylonian Talmud had become the agent of basic Jewish uniformity; the synthesis of philosophy and tradition had become the hallmark of the Jewish intelligentsia; and the Hebrew classics of the past had become the texts of study in Jewish schools everywhere.

<headtitle>Medieval European Judaism (950–1750)</headtitle>


-<h4 tocid="35209">

<headtitle>The two major branches</headtitle>


-<p>
Despite the fundamental uniformity of medieval Jewish culture, distinctive Jewish subcultures were shaped by the cultural and political divisions within the Mediterranean basin, in which Arabic Muslim and Latin Christian civilizations coexisted as discrete and self-contained societies. Two major branches of rabbinic civilization developed in Europe: the Ashkenazic, or Franco-German, and the Sephardic, or Andalusian-Spanish. Distinguished most conspicuously by their varying pronunciation of Hebrew, the numerous differences between them in religious orientation and practice derived, in the first instance, from the geographical fountainheads of their culture—the Ashkenazim (plural of 
<xref topicid="38290" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635562">Ashkenazi</xref>
) tracing their cultural filiation to Italy and Palestine and the Sephardim (plural of 
<xref topicid="535030" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635563">Sephardi</xref>
) to Babylonia—and from the influences of their respective immediate milieus. While the Jews of Christian 
<xref topicid="195686" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Europe</xref>
wrote for internal use almost exclusively in Hebrew, those of Muslim areas regularly employed Arabic for prose works and Hebrew for poetic composition. Whereas the literature of Jews in Latin areas was overwhelmingly religious in content, that of the Jews of Spain was well endowed with secular poetry and scientific works inspired by the cultural tastes of the Arabic literati. Most significantly, the two forms of European Judaism differed in their approaches to the identical rabbinic base that they had inherited from the East and in their attitudes to Gentile culture and politics.

In Muslim 
<xref topicid="557573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Spain</xref>
, Jews frequently served the government in official capacities and, therefore, not only took an active interest in political affairs but engaged in considerable social and intellectual intercourse with influential circles of the Muslim population. Since the support of letters and scholarship was part of state policy in Muslim Spain, and since Muslim savants traced the source of Muslim power to the vitality of the

, 
<xref topicid="530020" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">scripture</xref>
, and poetry, Jews looked at Arabic culture with undisguised admiration and unabashedly attempted to adapt themselves to its canons of scholarship and good taste. The cultured Jew accordingly demonstrated command of Arabic style and the ability to display the beauty of his own heritage through a philological mastery of the text of the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
and through the composition of Hebrew verse, now set to an Arabic metre. Since Arabic philosophers and scientists promulgated the compatibility of Greek philosophy with the revelation to Muhammad, rationalist study of the Jewish classics and defense of rabbinic faith in philosophical terms became dominant motifs in the Andalusian Jewish schools (in southern Spain).

The period of feverish literary creativity in classical Jewish disciplines as well as in the sciences in Spain has been called the golden age of 
<xref topicid="259083" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew literature</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1000–1148). Jewish culture of this age was distinguished by the supreme literary merit of its Hebrew poetry, the new spirit of relatively free and rationalist examination of hallowed texts and doctrines, and the extension of Jewish cultural perspectives to totally new horizons—mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philosophy, political theory, aesthetics, and belles-lettres. Noteworthy too was the frequent overlapping of the Sephardic religious leadership with the new Jewish courtier class. The unprecedented heights that the latter attained—

The effort to recapture the vitality and beauty of biblical poetry stimulated comparative philological and fresh exegetical research that yielded new insights into the morphology of the Hebrew language and into the historical soil of biblical prophecy. Judah ibn Ḥayyuj and Abū al-Walīd Marwān ibn Janāḥ produced manuals on biblical grammar that applied the results of Arabic philology to their own tongue and provided the principles of Hebrew grammatical study down to modern times. The anticipations of modern higher

by Judah ibn Balaʿam and Moses ibn Gikatilla (11th century) were popularized in Hebrew a few generations later by

Sephardic Jewry suddenly encountered a discrete, mature, Jewish culture that for centuries had been developing independently and along quite different lines.

</headtitle>


-<p>
The Ashkenazic Jewry, into whose communities the Sephardim had been thrust by political events, regarded their own heritage and the Christian world in which they lived from a perspective shaped exclusively by rabbinic categories. They drew their school texts and the values that determined their judgments from the Talmud and the Midrash. Sensing no intellectual challenge in Christian faith, which they regarded with thinly concealed contempt, they constituted for the most part a merchant class that lived in urban centres under the protection of ecclesiastical and temporal rulers but also under their own complex of laws and institutions. Except for mercantile relations, Christian society was closed to them, thanks largely to age-old ecclesiastical prohibitions forbidding all social intercourse with Jews. With the Arab conquest of Spain and the rise of the Carolingians (the dynasty that ruled western Europe in the 8th and 9th centuries), the 12-decade interlude of suppression by the Visigoths (589–711) came to an end, and the Roman precedent of toleration and autonomy again became the rule. Merchants and rabbis moved from Italy to France and the Rhineland and infused new energies into the Jewish communities there. An indigenous religious leadership began to emerge at the very time that Andalusian Jewry was entering its golden age. The First 
<xref topicid="144695" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598239">Crusade</xref>
(1096–99) unleashed a tide of hatred, periodic violence, and progressive restrictions on Jewish activities in the Rhineland, but the communities affected had attained sufficient resilience to reestablish their communal institutions shortly afterward and to continue the cultivation of their deeply ingrained traditions. 
</p>


-<p>
By 1150 Ashkenazic Jewry had established a culture of its own, with an indigenous literature that ranged from the popular homily to the esoteric tract on the nature of the divine glory. Study of the Bible and the Talmud was oriented toward a mystical pietism in which prayer and contemplation of the secrets embedded in the liturgy were to lead to religious experience. Significantly, the fathers of the Ashkenazic tradition were remembered as liturgical poets and initiates into divine mysteries, and the early codes of the Franco-German schools were heavily weighted with discussions of liturgical usage. After the Second Crusade (1147–49), the German Jewish mystics (also called 
<xref topicid="256573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hasidim</xref>
, or pietists) placed heavy emphasis on the merits of asceticism, martyrdom, and penitence, thus adapting to a Jewish idiom the features of saintliness then current in Christian Europe. For the masses of Jews, the cultural fare consisted principally of biblical tales and instruction as interpreted by rabbinic Midrash, the lives of scholars and saints, and liturgical poetry reaffirming the election of Israel and faith in messianic redemption. The chief vehicle of popular instruction consisted of anthologies from the rabbinic writings and commentaries on Scripture, of which the most popular was that of 
<xref topicid="491673" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes</xref>
(1040–1105), known as 
<xref topicid="491673" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598240">Rashi</xref>
, the acronym formed from the initials of his name in Hebrew. For the more advanced student, 
<xref topicid="491673" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rashi</xref>
composed a succinct commentary on the Talmud that achieved an authority approaching that of the text itself. 
</p>

<p>As living sources of law and values, the Bible and the Talmud had an impact on public and private, as well as secular and religious, affairs. Taking their cue from Talmudic precedent and from Christian ecclesiastical procedures of their own times, the Ashkenazic rabbis occasionally gathered in regional synods to enact legislation on problems of a general nature for which there was no adequate precedent in the literature. Among the most enduring of these measures were the prohibition of bigamy and arbitrary divorce and severe economic penalties for abandonment of wives. Of far more immediate concern to the average Jew were the circumvention of Talmudic prohibitions against usury, relaxation of prohibitions regarding traffic with Gentiles in wines, and adoption of severe disciplinary measures, such as excommunication, against informers or those appealing, in cases involving Jews, to the Gentile authorities.</p>


-<p>
A new religious trend began in Provence in the 13th century with the introduction into the Talmudic academies of a novel form of mystical study known as 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598242">Kabbala</xref>
(literally, “tradition”), which soon spread to northern Spain. Expressing gnostic doctrines in rabbinic guise, the devotees of 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kabbala</xref>
devised an esoteric vocabulary that reinterpreted the Bible and rabbinic law as allegories of the various modes in which God is manifested in a spiritual universe, access to which was reserved for initiates. The most renowned literary product of this new circle was the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="532573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zohar</xref>

</e>
(“The Book of Splendour”), a vast mystical commentary on the Pentateuch by 
<xref topicid="393604" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645568">Moses de León</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1250–1305); with later additions it became the Bible of Jewish mystics everywhere. Although some of the theological notions of the Kabbalists deviated from basic postulates of Jewish monotheism, the insistence of the mystics on unflagging ritual orthodoxy and on a nominal acceptance of the biblical text as divine revelation helped them avert the suspicions aroused by Jewish 
<xref topicid="34511" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Aristotelians</xref>
and 
<xref topicid="331825" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Averroists</xref>
—followers of the 12th-century Arabic Aristotelian philosopher 
<xref topicid="45595" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598243">Averroës</xref>
(1126–98)—and, in time, even won for them the status of a rabbinic elite. Indeed, in the early 13th century some of the mystics lent their support to a campaign that condemned the study of philosophy as generating skepticism, latitudinarianism, and disrespect for traditional literature.

<headtitle>Marginalization and expulsion</headtitle>

<p>Developments within the two major Jewish communities of medieval Europe were complicated by their uncertain relationship with the Christian community surrounding them. By all accounts, Christians and Jews had been on relatively good terms until the 11th century. In the early Middle Ages there were frequent contacts between Christians and Jews, who intermarried and shared language and culture. In the Carolingian era some bishops even complained that the Jews were favoured too much by Carolingian rulers. The situation became more complicated after about the year 1000, as Christian society began a process of reorganization that contributed to the marginalization of the Jews and other groups. Although the Jews did not endure unrelenting persecution and even enjoyed a cultural renaissance in the 12th century that paralleled a Christian one, they faced an increasingly hostile community that created a new theological image of the Jews and undermined the place of the Jews in society.</p>


-<p>
In the opening decade of the 11th century, Jews in various parts of Europe faced violent attacks and forced conversions that led some, according to one account, to commit suicide rather than accept baptism. Attacks against the Jews and full-scale massacres of Jews would occur throughout the rest of the Middle Ages, most notably at Mainz in the Rhineland in 1096, in England in 1198–90, in Franconia in 1298, and in France in 1320. The image of the Jews among Christians worsened, and numerous anti-Semitic stereotypes appeared in the 12th century. The most notorious example of these was the 
<xref topicid="69715" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">blood libel</xref>
, which alleged that the Jews killed Christian boys and used their blood to make unleavened bread. 
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, official legislation of the church confirmed the declining position of the Jews. Pope Innocent III issued a decretal declaring the Jews to be in perpetual servitude for the killing of Christ, and at the fourth Lateran Council in 1215 the Jews were ordered to wear distinctive clothing, forbidden to hold public office, and prohibited from appearing in public during the last three days of the Easter season. With the discovery and burning of the Talmud by Christians in the 13th century, the church’s view of the Jews worsened, because the church thus became aware that contemporary Jews were different from biblical Jews. The acceptance of the Talmud by the Jews was understood as heretical by the church, which had already launched a Crusade and the Inquisition against Christian heretics. The Jews’ failure to live up to the Christian understanding of them undermined the contemporary theological justification for their continued existence (i.e., until the end of time, as witness to the truth of Christian revelation).</p>


-<p>
Challenges also emerged in the economic and 
<xref topicid="551478" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">social order</xref>
as economic opportunities were increasingly restricted. Although there were Jewish merchants, artisans, and viticulturists throughout much of the Middle Ages, by the 12th and 13th centuries the Jews were limited to the occupation of 
<xref topicid="142287" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">money lending</xref>
, which brought some of them great wealth but also great animosity from borrowers. Moreover, the Jews were often an important source of capital for the monarchs of Europe. As an important source of revenue, the Jews provided a valuable service to the kings and thus received special protection in the law. This relationship, however, had an ominous side, as the Jews came to be defined in the law as the personal property of the king, to be exploited as he saw fit. Jews also lost their status as individuals and were secure only as long as they were of utility to their lords. 
</p>


-<p>
The declining economic usefulness of the Jews and the related deterioration of their social and religious status led to their expulsion from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Jews were also expelled from the 
<xref topicid="269851" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holy Roman Empire</xref>
and, most notoriously, from Spain in 1492. In Spain, anti-Jewish riots in the late 14th century had led to the conversion of large numbers of Jews, the so-called conversos. Spanish Christians, however, remained distrustful of the conversos, who were thought to maintain contact with uncoverted Jews and to practice the Jewish faith secretly. An inquisition established to deal with the conversos led to local expulsions in the 1480s. By 1492, however, the king and queen, Ferdinand and Isabella, and their inquisitors decided that the only real solution to the problem was the permanent separation of the conversos and the Jews. The Jews were compelled to choose between baptism and exile, and ultimately some 40,000 (estimates range as high as 800,000) departed Spain, never to return. They settled in Navarre (then outside the kingdom of Spain), North Africa, and 
<xref topicid="471439" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Portugal</xref>
. Many of those in Portugal, however, accepted Christianity as a result of an order of expulsion or conversion there in 1497.

<headtitle>Conflicts and new movements</headtitle>

<p>The conflict between philosophers and anti-philosophers in Provence and northern Spain represented a clash between two mature Jewish subcultures of diverse geographic origins, the Sephardic and the Ashkenazic, each of which had in the course of centuries developed different esoteric doctrines to transcend the legalistic formalism and confining dogmas of normative Judaism. Both forms of speculation sought salvation for exceptional individuals through knowledge and thus provided an immediate substitute for messianic deliverance from exile and servitude. Each group charged the other with distortion of tradition, and each issued apologias and excommunications characteristic of medieval doctrinal controversy. While the rifts between them reached bitter proportions, the common threat posed by ecclesiastical attacks on the Talmud in public disputations and by the expulsion of the Jews from France in 1306 prevented open rupture or resolution of the conflict. Ever since that time, two strands of orthodoxy representing the two forms of medieval metaphysical speculation have lived side by side in an uneasy truce.</p>


-<p>
Most rabbinic circles of the 14th and 15th centuries displayed a progressive dogmatism and insistence on uniformity of practice. The great 
<xref topicid="332806" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">legal code</xref>
of

of Toledo (

<e>c.</e>
1340), 
<e>Arbaʿa ṭurim</e>
(
<e>c.</e>
1335; “Four Rows”), which sought to level differences in usage between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, signified the dominant trend of the rabbinate. The increasing hardening of ideological lines, however, did not eliminate independent thinking. 
<xref topicid="12460" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645570">Isaac Albalag</xref>
(13th century) propounded an Averroist (rationalistic) interpretation of the Bible predicated on a theory of double truth (of reason and revelation), while Gersonides (
<xref topicid="337902" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645631">Levi ben Gershom</xref>
; 1288–1344), gave Jewish Aristotelianism a new and comprehensive formulation. In Muslim areas, the Maimonidean regimen of philosophical contemplation was extended by Maimonides’ son Abraham to a quest for pietist ecstasy that seemed to have much in common with 
<xref topicid="571823" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645626">Sufism</xref>
(Islamic mysticism). 
</p>

The anti-Jewish riots in Spain and their consequences stimulated the anti-intellectualism of the rabbinate. 
<xref topicid="142625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598247">Hasdai Crescas</xref>
(1340–1410), while conceding the philosophical untenability of traditional belief in

(
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="159526" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645634">determinism</xref>
), launched a scathing attack on Aristotelian approaches to religion, and his disciple 
<xref topicid="13063" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598248">Joseph Albo</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1380–
<e>c.</e>
1444) issued a compendium on dogma that reaffirmed the traditional postulates of divine creation, revelation, and retribution as axioms of Judaism. But these reassertions of traditional faith could not overcome the ideological and social fragmentation that had split the Spanish communities, often leaving them in open conflict with each other. Widespread marranism (ostensible conversion to Christianity) polarized the community and left residues of bitterness toward those returning to the fold (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="366145" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645635">Marrano</xref>
). The expulsions from Spain and Portugal drove the leadership into intensified pursuits of mystical escape from, and rationalization of, the endless calamities that befell their flocks. In Italy and the 
<xref topicid="434996" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ottoman Empire</xref>
(Asia Minor, northeastern Africa, and southeastern Europe)—the two principal centres of refuge for the exiles of the Iberian Peninsula—legalistic 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kabbalism</xref>
, which insisted on strict observance of the law as a precondition of mystical practice and study, became the dominant form of rabbinic leadership. Despite the terrible circumstances, the rabbinate continued to produce works of encyclopaedic proportions and staggering erudition in every field of Jewish learning. 
</p>


-<p>
Inspired by the Jewish tradition that the coming of the messiah would be preceded by horrendous catastrophes, a group of rabbis established a community in Ẕefat (Safed), Palestine, where, in anticipation of the new dawn, every aspect of life was conducted on principles of saintliness and mystical contemplation. Under the leadership of Jacob Berab, the ancient practice of ordination (
<e>semikha</e>
) was reinstituted in 1538 to form the nucleus of a revived Sanhedrin that would administer ritual procedures requiring fully ordained authorities. Although the effort failed because of rabbinic opposition, it reflected the temper of the times and further fanned messianic hopes sparked shortly before by the campaigns of Solomon Molkho (
<e>c.</e>
1500–32) and 
<xref topicid="500211" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645638">David Reubeni</xref>
(died after 1532) in Italy; Molkho was burned at the stake by the Christian authorities, and Reubeni died in prison. In Ẕefat itself, Kabbalism soon entered a new phase under the inspiration of 
<xref topicid="351761" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645640">Isaac Luria</xref>
(1534–72) and 
<xref topicid="630904" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ḥayyim Vital</xref>
(1543–1620), who confided to their disciples that the calamities of Israel were but a mirror of the captivity into which many sparks of the Godhead itself had fallen. Liturgical innovations and a novel 
<xref topicid="400861" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">mystical theology</xref>
were formulated to redeem the imprisoned elements of divinity and thus restore creation to the harmony intended for it. 
</p>


-<p>
That the Almighty himself was not quite omnipotent, at least with respect to the fate of his chosen people, was cautiously hinted in a Hebrew work of history (1550) by Solomon ibn Verga (1460–1554), who regarded the Jewish problem as a sociopolitical one to which theological answers were futile. Such guarded rationalism was entertained by a number of courageous thinkers in 16th-century Italy, where, despite the policy of ghettoization (the segregation of the Jewish community in a restricted quarter) begun by Venice in 1516 and soon extended to all major Italian cities, the spirit of the Renaissance and the passion for historical criticism had captivated many Jews. Catholic scholars and prelates occasionally employed rabbis to instruct them in the Hebrew language and in the secrets of the Kabbala, which some Christians believed actually verified the postulates of their own faith. Contacts with Christian scholars in turn introduced Jews such as Azariah dei Rossi (
<e>c.</e>
1513–78), whose 
<e>Meor ʿenayim</e>
(“Enlightenment of the Eyes”) inaugurated critical textual study of rabbinical texts, to new bodies of literature that had been lost to the Jewish community, such as the works of Philo and Josephus. 
</p>


-<p>
Such phenomena, however, were comparatively rare and isolated. The spread of dogmatic Kabbalism eventually led to the widespread acceptance of the views of the pseudo-messiah 
<xref topicid="537449" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598250">Shabbetai Tzevi</xref>
(1626–76). Most of European and Ottoman Jewry was swept into near hysteria in the belief that the end was now finally at hand. When Shabbetai converted to Islam after being apprehended by the Ottoman government, all but his most faithful followers were despondent, though some tried to explain the apostasy of the pseudo-messiah as a form of voluntary crucifixion for the sake of the Jews. A witch hunt on the part of traditionalists to uncover the remaining cells of heresy unsettled Jewish communities everywhere. 
</p>


-<p>
The following century (to 
<e>c.</e>
1750) was the darkest in the history of Rabbinic Judaism. Scholarship declined and popular religion became mechanical to an extent that Jews had never before experienced. Polish Jews suffered terribly during the Deluge, a period of peasant revolts and war involving Poland, Russia, and Sweden that began in 1648. The Jews were slaughtered by rebels and professional soldiers during the war, which was fought mostly on Polish soil, and many survivors were sold as slaves in Turkey. The massacres and impoverishment of Polish Jewry after 1648 brought a pall over the growing eastern European centres of Jewish life. Antinomian eruptions of extreme Shabbetaians under the leadership of the self-proclaimed messiah and later Catholic convert 
<xref topicid="217179" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598251">Jacob Frank</xref>
(1726–91) alarmed Gentile authorities almost as much as they did Jews. But the fossilization referred to above was only apparent. Beneath the surface many were restlessly searching for new avenues of faith, and the 18th century saw fresh responses that set the history of the Jews and of Judaism in new directions and marked the beginning of a new era.

The criteria used to identify dividing points in the history of the Jews and Judaism are especially notable when it comes to the start of the modern period. Historians of thought traditionally place this point in the late 17th century, with the appearance of those who abandoned, in part or in toto, their inherited Jewish faith but continued to regard themselves—and to be regarded by others—as Jews. Some Israeli scholars prefer a date of about 1700, with the first stirrings of the emigration from the Diaspora to the 
<xref topicid="439645" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holy Land</xref>
, which culminated in the mid-20th century in the creation of the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645886">State of Israel</xref>
. Political and social historians put the start of the modern period in the second half of the 18th century, when the American and French revolutions eventually resulted in the emancipation of Jews from discriminatory and segregative laws and customs, their attainment of legal status as citizens, and the freedom of individual Jews to pursue careers appropriate to their talents. These varying approaches have one thing in common: the view that the start of the modern period is marked by the end of the doctrine of the exile, whereby Jews saw themselves as a people waiting out centuries of woe in alien lands until the moment of divine redemption. Jewish modernity for most scholars is characterized by the end of a passive waiting for the messiah and the beginning of an active pursuit of personal or national fulfillment on this earth and preferably in one’s own lifetime.

Although the 18th century 
<xref topicid="256614" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598324">Haskala</xref>
(Enlightenment) among the Ashkenazim of central and eastern Europe is often taken as the starting point of Jewish modernity, the process of Westernization had begun a good deal earlier among the Sephardim in western Europe and in Italy. The 
<xref topicid="366145" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Marranos</xref>
who went to the Jewish communities of Amsterdam and Venice in the 17th century to declare themselves Jews carried with them the Western education that they had acquired while living as Christians in the 
<xref topicid="280587" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Iberian Peninsula</xref>
, as well as the habits of criticism that had kept them from assimilating into the majority during their 
<xref topicid="366145" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Marrano</xref>
years. Some, such as 
<xref topicid="560202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598330">Benedict (Baruch) de Spinoza</xref>
(1632–77), a son of Marranos, applied these skills to all of the biblical tradition, including especially their own religion. In Italy there was an older Jewish community that had never been sealed off culturally from the influence of its environment; some of its figures were influenced by, and participated in, the main currents of the Renaissance. 
</p>

<p>Increased contact with Western languages, manners, and customs came to the Ashkenazim only in the 18th century, when new economic opportunities created such possibilities. Jewish bankers and brokers in various German principalities, army provisioners in most European countries, capitalists who were permitted to live in places such as Berlin because they opened new factories or were otherwise helpful to the expansion of the economy—all were in increasing contact with Gentile society, and most of them began to strive for full acceptance. Around this wealthy element there arose a number of intellectuals who agitated for the end of ghettoization as a necessary preamble to the emancipation of the Jews.</p>

The most outstanding figure of the 18th-century 
<xref topicid="256614" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jewish Enlightenment</xref>
was the philosopher 
<xref topicid="374802" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598333">Moses Mendelssohn</xref>
(1729–86), a devoted adherent of traditional Judaism who turned away from the historic Jewish preoccupation with the Talmud and its literature to the intellectual world of the European Enlightenment. Mendelssohn did not attempt a philosophical defense of Judaism until pressed to do so by Christians who questioned how he could remain faithful to what they saw as an unenlightened religion. In his response, 
<e>Jerusalem</e>
, published in 1783, Mendelssohn defended the validity of Judaism as the inherited faith of the Jews by defining it as revealed divine legislation, and he declared himself at the same time to be a believer in the universal religion of reason, of which Judaism was but one historical manifestation. Aware that he was accepted by Gentile society as an “exceptional Jew” who had embraced Western culture, Mendelssohn’s message to his own community was to become Westerners, to seek out the culture of the Enlightenment. To that end he joined with a poet, Naphtali Herz (Hartwig) Wessely (1725–1805), in translating the Torah into German, combining Hebrew characters with modern German phonetics in an effort to displace 
<xref topicid="653218" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598335">Yiddish</xref>
, and wrote a modern biblical commentary in Hebrew, the 
<e>Beʾur </e>
(“Commentary”). Within a generation, Mendelssohn’s Bible was to be found in almost every literate Jewish home in central Europe, serving to introduce its readers to German culture. Through his personal example and his life’s work, Mendelssohn made it possible for his fellow Jews to join the Western world without sacrificing their Judaism; indeed, he convinced them that Judaism is compatible with an intellectual commitment to universal reason. 
</p>


-<p>
Mendelssohn’s work was carried on by the Berlin 
<xref topicid="256614" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Haskala</xref>
, a group of Jewish intellectuals who had gathered around Mendelssohn during his lifetime; the Haskala was most active in the 20 years following his death. In the pages of their Hebrew-language periodical, 
<e>Ha-Meʾassef</e>
(“The Collector”), they preached the virtues of secular culture and publicized the need for secular education. In response to the 
<xref topicid="598608" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Edict of Toleration</xref>
promulgated in 1781 by the Holy Roman emperor 
<xref topicid="306348" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Joseph II</xref>
(reigned 1765–90), Naphtali Wessely issued an urgent call for the reform of Jewish education as a prelude to full emancipation. Secular subjects—mathematics, German, and world history and literature—were to take precedence over traditional Jewish studies. The study of the Bible, because it was generally acknowledged to be a fundamental part of Western culture, was to be emphasized at the expense of the customary focus on the Talmud. Following this model, modern Jewish schools were established by Jewish intellectuals and businessmen in several German cities, among them Frankfurt and Hamburg. As its educational activities began to bear fruit in the wide dissemination of secular culture, the Berlin Haskala abandoned the use of Hebrew for German and gradually disintegrated. Unlike Mendelssohn himself, his immediate intellectual descendants, including his own children, were unable to strike a balance between Jewish and secular culture; their Western education undermined their religious faith, and they saw themselves as Europeans rather than as Jews. 
</p>

<p>One of Mendelssohn’s disciples, David Friedlaender, offered to convert to Christianity without accepting Christian dogma or Christian rites; he felt that both Judaism and Christianity shared the same religious truth but that there was no relation at all between that truth and Judaism’s ceremonial law. The offer was refused because Friedlaender would not acknowledge the superiority of Christianity and make an unconditional commitment to it. Unlike Friedlaender, many other followers of Mendelssohn chose to leave the Jewish faith as the only way to win full acceptance in European society.</p>

Thus, the Haskala was quickly played out in central Europe; as an idea, its further career was to continue in eastern Europe, particularly in the 
<xref topicid="513251" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Russian</xref>
Empire, where it flourished in the middle third of the 19th century until, as a result of the 
<xref topicid="466210" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598336">pogroms</xref>
of 1881, Jews lost faith in the willingness of Russians to accept “enlightened” Jews. It was a tenet of the Russian Haskala that the tsar was a benevolent leader who would bestow emancipation upon his Jewish subjects as soon as they proved themselves worthy of it. A goal of the Russian Haskala, therefore, was for the Jews to transform themselves into model citizens—enlightened, unsuperstitious, devoted to secular learning and productive occupations. Following the example of the Berlin Haskala, a Russian Hebrew-language writer, 
<xref topicid="294933" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Isaac</xref>
Baer Levinsohn (1788–1860), published a pamphlet, 
<e>Teʿuda be-Yisrael</e>
(“Testimony in Israel”), extolling the benefits of secular education. At the same time, writers such as Joseph Perl (1774–1839) and Isaac Erter (1792–1851), though traditional Jews themselves, attacked in virulent satire the superstitious folk customs of the masses, thereby opening the way to the anticlericalism that became characteristic of the Russian Haskala. 
</p>


-<p>
In the 1840s and ’50s the group’s emphasis shifted from satirical attacks on the cultural parochialism of the 
<xref topicid="439316" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598337">Pale</xref>
of Settlement (the regions to which the Jews were restricted) to romanticization of life outside the Pale, including periods of the Jewish past. Thus, Hebrew poets and novelists in Russia, such as Micah Judah Lebensohn (1828–52) and 
<xref topicid="363610" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645654">Abraham Mapu</xref>
(1808–67), contributed to the creation of a modern 
<xref topicid="259083" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew literature</xref>
. In the 1860s the Russian Haskala, reflecting the larger political climate, entered a “positivist” phase, calling for practical social and economic reforms. Hebrew-language journals were established, and the Hebrew essay and didactic poetry, calling for religious and cultural reforms, came into their own, particularly in the hands of the poet 
<xref topicid="239127" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645655">Judah Leib Gordon</xref>
(1830–92) and the essayist Moses Leib Lilienblum (1843–1910). Abandoning the original Hebrew and German orientation of the Russian Haskala, a number of Jewish intellectuals—the most prominent of whom were Yoachim Tarnopol (1810–1900), Osip Rabinovich (1817–69), and Lev Levanda (1835–88)—became Russifiers, founding Russian-language Jewish weeklies devoted to “patriotism, emancipation, modernism.” Like their contemporary fellow Jews in western Europe, they declared themselves to be Russians by nationality and Jews by religious belief alone. In 1863 a group of wealthy Jews in St. Petersburg and Odessa created the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia for the purpose of educating Russian Jewry into “readiness for citizenship.” The goal of all segments of the Russian Haskala in the 1860s and ’70s was to turn Jews into good Russians and to make their Jewishness a matter of personal choice. But the hopes of the Haskala were upset by the reaction of Russians following the assassination of Tsar 
<xref topicid="14059" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1808561">Alexander II</xref>
in 1881. Several Jewish communities were destroyed in pogroms, which often received the tacit approval of the governing authorities. Jewish economic life was severely curtailed, and quotas for Jewish students were put in place in secular educational institutions. The bright optimism of Russian-Jewish intellectuals faded.

<headtitle>Religious reform movements</headtitle>


-<p>
One element of Westernization that the Haskala championed was the reform of religion. This movement began in western Europe during the 
<xref topicid="402943" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Napoleonic</xref>
period (1800–15), when certain aspects of Jewish belief and observance were seen as incompatible with the new position of the Jew in Western society. Napoleon convoked a Sanhedrin in 1807 to create a modern definition of Judaism that renounced Jewish nationhood and national aspirations, asserted that rabbinic authority was purely spiritual, and recognized the priority of civil over religious authority even in matters of intermarriage. In countries other than France, the rationale for reform, at least in its early years, was more aesthetic than doctrinal. The external aspects of Jewish worship—i.e., the form of the service—was unacceptable to the newly Westernized members of the Jewish bourgeoisie in both Germany and the 
<xref topicid="616563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">United States</xref>
, whose cultural standards had been shaped by the surrounding society and who desired above all to resemble their Gentile peers. Thus, the short-lived 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Reform</xref>
temple established in Seesen in 1810 by the pioneer German reformer Israel Jacobson (1768–1828) introduced organ and choir music, allowed men and women to sit together during worship, delivered the sermon in German instead of Hebrew, and omitted liturgical references to a personal messiah and the restoration of Israel. A more radical temple established in Hamburg in 1818 adopted all of Jacobson’s reforms and published its own much-abridged prayer book, which deleted almost all references to the long-awaited restoration of Zion. Reformers in Charleston, 
<xref topicid="556096" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">South Carolina</xref>
, introduced similar changes in the synagogue ritual in 1824. It was apparent to the reformers that in Western society Judaism would have to divest itself of its alien customs and conform to the cultural and intellectual standards of the new “age of reason.” 
</p>


-<p>
German Reform in the 1840s became institutionalized, a matter of organized formal belief and practice. At a series of synods held at Brunswick (1844), Frankfurt (1845), and Breslau (1846), it created the first theological rationalization for changes introduced to the faith in the previous generation. Judaism, it was declared, had always been a developmental religion that conformed to the demands of the times. Moreover, the reformers maintained, the Jews were no longer a nation and therefore were bound not by their religious and political code of law but only by the dictates of moral law. Rituals that impeded full Jewish participation in German social and political life were no longer considered valid expressions of Jewish religious truth. The use of Hebrew in religious services was limited; practices such as circumcision and the 
<xref topicid="162787" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">dietary laws</xref>
and all national messianic hopes were questioned in light of the “spirit of the times.” Messianism in 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Reform Judaism</xref>
was transformed into active concern for social welfare in the present, and the Jewish role in history became Diaspora-centred; some even thought of it as constituting a mission to the Gentiles. 
</p>


-<p>
Although 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Reform Judaism</xref>
was initiated in Europe, its success was limited there because many central European governments would not recognize more than one form of Judaism in any one locale. Even in areas where it had taken root, by the middle of the 19th century, European Reform (now usually called “Liberal Judaism”) lost much of its early radicalism. Reform was much more successful in the United States, where it was carried by massive numbers of German Jewish immigrants in the 1840s and where it coalesced with existing American reform movements. By 1880 almost all of the 200 synagogues in the United States (amalgamated in the 
<xref topicid="19755" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Union of American Hebrew Congregations</xref>
in 1873) were Reform. In 1885 a conference of Reform rabbis formulated what was then the most comprehensive statement of Reform philosophy in the so-called Pittsburgh Platform. This manifesto announced that Judaism was an evolutionary faith and no longer a national one, and it declared that the Mosaic and rabbinical laws regulating diet, purity, and dress were “entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state.” While the preservation of historical identity was considered beneficial, the maintenance of tradition was not; the Talmud was to be treated merely as religious literature, not as legislation. The principles of the Pittsburgh Platform remained the official philosophy of the American Reform movement until 1937, when a later generation, seeking to meet different emotional and intellectual needs, reintroduced the concept of Jewish personhood into the Columbus Platform; this document also reemphasized Hebrew and traditional liturgy and practices. After 
<xref topicid="648813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">World War II</xref>
, Reform in the United States developed along two tracks. It departed in new ways from traditional Judaism in ordaining women (1972), allowing patrilineal descent (1983), and sanctifying same-sex marriage (2000). On the other hand, some Reform Jews began reintegrating long-discarded rituals into worship services. This neo-ritualism stimulated greater use of Hebrew in prayer books and a more dynamic 
<xref topicid="307197" tocid="35224" ty="3" refid="1833890">Zionism</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
If Reform was a child of Enlightenment rationalism, 
<xref topicid="133461" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598375">Conservative Judaism</xref>
was a child of historical romanticism. It began in 1845, when 
<xref topicid="217207" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598376">Zacharias Frankel</xref>
(1801–75) and a group of followers seceded from a second Reform synod at Frankfurt over the issue of limiting the use of Hebrew to a small core of prayers. For Frankel, Hebrew represented the spirit of Judaism and the Jewish people, and Judaism itself was not merely a theology of ethics but the historical expression of the Jewish experience; this definition he called “positive-historical Judaism.” Although 
<xref topicid="133461" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Conservative Judaism</xref>
conceived of Judaism as a developmental religion, it charted its course through close study of tradition and the will of the people and thus came to largely traditional conclusions about religious observance.

Although affected by the efforts at religious reform, the bulk of the official Jewish establishment in western and central Europe remained 
<xref topicid="433416" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598494">Orthodox</xref>
(a term first used by Reform leaders to designate their traditionalist opponents). Under the leadership of 
<xref topicid="266851" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598495">Samson Raphael Hirsch</xref>
(1808–88) in Frankfurt, a more modern and militant form of Judaism arose. Known as Neo-Orthodoxy, the new movement asserted its right to break with any Jewish community that contained Reform elements. The teachings of Neo-Orthodoxy were profoundly influential, for they indicated the possibility of living a ritually and religiously full life while being totally integrated into Western society. This was accomplished by positing a theoretical division between religion and culture: in religion the Jews were to remain Orthodox (though deferring their messianic aspirations to the unforeseeable future), while in manners and culture they were to become Western. This form of Orthodoxy, which became the intellectual model for Western Orthodoxy, continued into the 21st century in the United States in a variety of religious and academic institutions (such as the

<headtitle>In eastern Europe</headtitle>


-<p>
By the mid-18th century, Orthodoxy in eastern Europe, having been convulsed by frantic messianism and stifled by the sterility of legalistic scholarship, was ripe for revival. In the mid-17th century the experience of 
<xref topicid="537459" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shabbetaianism</xref>
, the first messianic movement to excite virtually all of world Jewry, had revealed the pervasiveness of Jewish exhaustion with the Exile and fervent longing for messianic redemption. Later, in the 18th century, the nihilistic sect of Frankists (the followers of 
<xref topicid="217179" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jacob Frank</xref>
) transformed that longing into a this-worldly hysteria. Talmudic piety and study, sunk in excessive 
<e>pilpul</e>
(acute logical distinctions that often became mere hairsplitting), was refreshed by the new critical methods of 
<xref topicid="184637" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598496">Elijah ben Solomon</xref>
(1720–97), the gaon of Vilna. Although essentially a legal rigorist, he was open to more-scientific methods of textual analysis insofar as they helped him to elucidate Talmudic texts. Orthodox religious expression also was raised to a new level with the development of Hasidism
<xref topicid="256573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0"/>
(pietism) by Israel 
<xref topicid="47272" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Baʿal Shem Tov</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1700–60) in the mid-18th century. Hasidism contained elements of social protest, being at least in part a movement of the poor against the wealthy communal leadership and of the unlearned against the learned—though many of its leaders, among them Rabbi Dov Baer (1710–72), who was the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="356577" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">maggid</xref>

</e>
(“preacher”) of Mezhirich, and Rabbi Levi Isaac of Berdichev (1740–1810), were well-versed in Talmudic learning. Nevertheless, it was essentially a non-messianic outcry in the name of piety, emphasizing prayer and personal religious devotion here and now. The major innovation that Hasidism introduced into Jewish religious life was the charismatic leader, the 
<e>rebbe</e>
, who served as teacher, confessor, wonder-worker, God’s vicar on earth, and, occasionally, atoning sacrifice. The earliest 
<e>rebbe</e>
s were democratically chosen, but spiritual dynasties formed as the position of leadership passed to the descendants of the first 
<e>rebbe</e>
s on the presumption that they had inherited their fathers’ charisma. Hasidism spread throughout eastern Europe and was most successful in Poland. 
</p>


-<p>
Hasidism made little headway in 
<xref topicid="343803" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Lithuania</xref>
, where the traditional rabbinic class, under the leadership of 
<xref topicid="184637" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645699">Elijah ben Solomon</xref>
, was able to stave off its influence by issuing a ban of excommunication (
<e>ḥerem</e>
, “anathema”) against the new movement. The tactic, which involved a complete boycott and cutting off of communication, was widely embraced by non-Hasidic rabbis, who were given the title of Mitnaggedim (“Opponents”) by the Hasidim. In areas where the rabbis had lost the respect of the masses, however, the 
<e>ḥerem</e>
proved largely ineffective, and it called forth a round of counter-excommunications by the Hasidic rebbes. With the passage of time, Hasidim and Mitnaggedim abandoned their conflict and came to see each other as allies against the threat to all Orthodox Jewish religion posed by Haskala and secularization. The impact of Hasidism on eastern European Jewry cannot be overemphasized; even in Lithuania, where it did not take firm hold, it stimulated the growth of a homegrown pietism in the 
<xref topicid="398489" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Musar</xref>
(ethicist) movement of the mid-19th century, and it renewed the Talmudic energies of its opponents.

<headtitle>Developments in scholarship</headtitle>


-<p>
As the Jews of central Europe moved into mainstream society, a group of young Jewish intellectuals devoted themselves to Jewish scholarship of a type far different from traditional Talmudic learning or medieval philosophy. In 1819 
<xref topicid="658441" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598497">Leopold Zunz</xref>
(1794–1886) and Moses Moser (1796–1838) founded the Society for Jewish Culture and Learning. The original group quickly dissolved, however, and Zunz became the unofficial leader of a generation of scholars dedicated to the 
<e>Wissenschaft des Judentums</e>
(“science of Judaism”). 
</p>


-<p>
The Wissenschaft movement sought to prove that the Jewish past was intellectually respectable and worthy of study, and hence that the Jews deserved an equal place within European societies. Jewish scholarship was enlisted as a weapon in the battles for change. Thus, Isaac M. Jost (1793–1860) wrote a general history of the Jews to promote Reform, Zunz’s 
<e>Gottesdienstliche Vorträge der Juden, historisch entwickelt</e>
(1832; “The Worship Sermons of the Jews, Historically Developed”) served to legitimize the modern innovation of the sermon in the vernacular, and 
<xref topicid="227807" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645704">Abraham Geiger</xref>
(1810–74), the outstanding leader of German Reform in the 1840s and ’50s, interpreted the Pharisees as the forerunners of the reformers of his own day. In their work, these intellectuals presented archetypes of what modern Jews should become. To support their claims of academic respectability, the Wissenschaft figures highlighted those aspects of the Jewish past that were closely integrated with general fields of study. In particular, Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907), who owes his fame to towering achievements in bibliography, was concerned above all with the contribution of Jews to science, medicine, and mathematics. These scholars set out to praise Judaism as one of the cofounders of the Western tradition; they argued that, because the Jews produced great culture whenever they were not excluded from European society, they would repeat such accomplishments under conditions of social and political equality. 
</p>


-<p>
The Wissenschaft movement stimulated the critical study of the Jewish past, and great works of synthesis written from a variety of perspectives began to appear: the multivolume 
<e>Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart </e>
(1853–76; 
<e>History of the Jews</e>
), written from a romantic-national point of view by 
<xref topicid="240645" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645705">Heinrich Graetz</xref>
(1817–91); 
<e>Dorot ha-rishonim</e>
(1897–1932; “The First Generations”), by Isaac Halevy (1847–1914); 
<e>Toldot Yisrael</e>
(1894; “History of Israel”), written from an orthodox standpoint by Zeʾev Jawitz; and 
<e>Die Weltgeschichte des jüdischen Volkes</e>
(1925–30; “The World History of the Jewish People”) by 
<xref topicid="172779" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645726">Simon Dubnow</xref>
(1860–1941), reflecting his belief in secular, nationalistic communal autonomy. After the 1920s this tradition of great synthesis was carried on in the United States by 
<xref topicid="53780" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645727">Salo W. Baron</xref>
(1895–1989), who by the early 1980s had produced 18 volumes of his 
<e>Social and Religious History of the Jews </e>
(1952–83), and in Israel by Ben-Zion Dinur (1884–1973), whose chief work was 
<e>Yisrael ba-gola</e>
(3rd ed., 5 vol., 1961–66; “Israel in the Exile”). Many other first-rank scholars in Europe, Israel, and the United States have made notable contributions to the study of Jewish history, rabbinics, and mysticism.

Jewish-Christian relations in the 19th century were strained at best and often broke down during periods of open conflict. The established Christian churches, particularly 
<xref topicid="507284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Roman Catholicism</xref>

and as the carriers of liberal, secular, anticlerical, and often revolutionary doctrines. Clerical 
<xref topicid="27646" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598498">anti-Semitism</xref>
allied itself with the anti-Semitism of the traditional right in France, and both forms contended with movements that supported the results of the French Revolution in the great convulsion of the

in the last years of the 19th century (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="171509" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635966">Dreyfus, Alfred</xref>
). In 
<xref topicid="513251" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Russia</xref>
the conflict between the Jews and the 
<xref topicid="177174" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Orthodox Church</xref>
released the most open and virulent manifestation of religious anti-Semitism. In the view of the church, the Jews were seeking to undermine Russian Orthodoxy and the tsar, the very foundations of Russian society. The church and the tsarist authorities condoned—and even encouraged—violent 
<xref topicid="466210" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">pogroms</xref>
against the Jews in 1881–82 and again in 1905. 
</p>


-<p>
Russian Orthodoxy was also active in spreading the 
<xref topicid="69715" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">blood libel</xref>
, a superstitious belief in Jewish ritual murder of Christian children whose blood would be used to make unleavened bread at Passover. The blood libel first emerged in the 12th century and often led to the persecution of Jews; it reemerged in Damascus in 1840 (in which instance the French consul in Syria initiated the accusation) and in Tiszaeszlár, Hungary, in 1882. In both cases, torture was used to obtain false confessions, though the accused were ultimately cleared. The most infamous occurrence of the blood libel in modern times was the case of Mendel Beilis, a Jewish bookkeeper in Odessa who was accused of ritual murder by the tsarist government in 1911. Imprisoned for more than two years, he was eventually acquitted by an all-Christian jury.

-<p>
From Russian Orthodox circles too arose the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="480269" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</xref>

, a fraudulent documentation of an alleged international Jewish conspiracy to conquer the world by subverting the

through liberalism, 
<xref topicid="218618" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635972">Freemasonry</xref>

<e>Protocols</e>
was widely used in anti-Semitic propaganda in Europe, the United States, and the Arab world into the 21st century. 
</p>


-<p>
In the 20th century, Jews and Christians moved toward mutual understanding. Although many Christians continued to hold irrational and hostile attitudes toward Jews, some liberal Christian voices were raised against anti-Semitism in the early decades of the century. In the United States the National Conference of Christians and Jews was founded in 1928 in response to the virulent anti-Semitism propagated in Henry Ford’s newspaper, the 
<e>Dearborn Independent</e>
. Some Christian leaders spoke out during the 
<xref topicid="648813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">1930s</xref>
against the Nazi persecution of the Jews, but the majority of Christian leaders in Europe remained silent, even during the 
<xref topicid="269548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645795">Holocaust</xref>
. In 1946, however, the 
<xref topicid="648248" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">World Council of Churches</xref>
denounced anti-Semitism, and in 1965 the 
<xref topicid="624014" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Second Vatican Council</xref>
of the 
<xref topicid="507284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Roman Catholic Church</xref>
adopted the schema on the Jews and other non-Christian religions, which formally revised the church’s traditional attitude toward the Jews as the killers of Christ. A growing feeling of ecumenism was shared between Jews and Christians; indeed, Pope 
<xref topicid="305139" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1635973">John Paul II</xref>
made improved relations between Catholics and Jews a hallmark of his papacy. Although there remain many difficulties related to the question of the place that 
<xref topicid="657475" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zionism</xref>
and the State of Israel hold within Judaism, the older forms of official church anti-Semitism have been radically diminished.

The most striking of the new phenomena in Jewish life was 
<xref topicid="657475" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645757">Zionism</xref>
, which, insofar as it focused on the return to 
<xref topicid="657453" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645758">Zion</xref>
(the poetic term for the Holy Land), recalled older religious themes. Because it stressed the establishment of a secular state, however, Zionism was yet another example of the secularization of Jewish life and of Jewish messianism. In its secular aspects, Zionism attempted to complete the emancipation of the Jews by transforming them into a nation like all other nations. Although it drew upon the general currents of 19th-century European nationalism, its major impetus came from the revival of a virulent form of racist anti-Semitism in the last decades of the 19th century, as noted above. Zionism reacted to anti-Semitic contentions that the Jews were aliens in European society and could never hope to be integrated into it in significant numbers; it transformed this charge into a basic premise of a program of national regeneration and resettlement. Zionism has come to occupy roughly the same place in Jewish life as the 
<xref topicid="551238" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636162">Social Gospel</xref>
did in Christian life. Involvement in Israel as the new centre of Jewish energies, creativity, and renewal served as a kind of secular religion for many Diaspora Jews.

The history of Judaism in the 
<xref topicid="616563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">United States</xref>
is the story of several fresh beginnings. In the colonial period the character of the tiny American Jewish community was shaped by the earliest Sephardic immigrants. The community was officially Orthodox but, unlike European Jewish communities, was voluntaristic, and by the early 19th century much of the younger generation had moved away from the faith. By the mid-19th century a new wave of central European immigrants revived the declining community and remade it to serve their own needs. Primarily small shopkeepers and traders, the new immigrants migrated westward, founding new Jewish centres that were almost entirely controlled by laymen. 
</p>


-<p>
Life on the frontier in an open society created a predisposition for religious reform, and it is significant that the greatest American Reform Jewish leader of the 19th century, 
<xref topicid="645934" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598508">Isaac Mayer Wise</xref>
(1819–1900), was based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Wise sought to unite all of American Jewry in the new nontraditional institutions that he founded: the 
<xref topicid="19755" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645760">Union of American Hebrew Congregations</xref>
(1873), 
<xref topicid="259102" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645761">Hebrew Union College</xref>
(1875), and the Central Conference of American Rabbis (1889); but his ever more radical reforming spirit ultimately drove traditionalist elements into opposition. 
</p>


-<p>
The head of the traditionalists was Isaac Leeser (1806–68), a native of Germany, who had attempted to create an 
<xref topicid="405873" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">indigenous American</xref>
community along the lines of a modernized traditionalism. After his death, Conservative forces became disorganized, but, in reaction to Reform, they defined themselves by their attachment to the Sabbath, the dietary laws, and especially to Hebrew as the language of prayer. Under the leadership of Sabato Morais (1823–97), a traditional Sephardic Jew of Italian birth, Conservative circles in 1886 founded a rabbinic seminary of their own, the 
<xref topicid="303646" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645759">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
The eastern European immigrants who moved in large numbers to American shores from 1881 to 1914 were profoundly different in culture and manners from the older elements of the American Jewish community, and they and their descendants have made American Judaism what it is today. The bridge between the existing Jewish community led by German Jews of Reform persuasion and the new immigrant masses was the traditionalist element among the older settlers. A traditionalist, 
<xref topicid="6049" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1598509">Cyrus Adler</xref>
(1863–1940), cooperated with the German Reform circle of 
<xref topicid="527333" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645763">Jacob Schiff</xref>
(1847–1920) in reorganizing the Jewish Theological Seminary (1902) and other institutions for the purpose of Americanizing the eastern European immigrants. Enough eastern European rabbis and scholars had immigrated, however, to create their own synagogues, which reproduced the customs of the Old World. In 1880 almost all of the 200 Jewish congregations in the United States were Reform, but by 1890 there were 533 synagogues, and most of the new ones founded by immigrant groups were Orthodox. The 
<xref topicid="433414" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645765">Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations</xref>
, which was established in 1898 by elements associated with the Jewish Theological Seminary, was soon taken over by Yiddish-speaking recent immigrants for whom the seminary was much too liberal. In 1902 immigrant rabbis also formed their own body, the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and 
<xref topicid="91513" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Canada</xref>
(the Agudath ha-Rabbanim), which fostered the creation of 
<xref topicid="653077" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">yeshivas</xref>
(rabbinic academies) of the old type. In 1915 two small yeshivas, Etz Chaim and Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Theological Seminary, merged and undertook a program of further growth, adding 
<xref topicid="653081" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Yeshiva College</xref>
of secular studies in 1928 and becoming 
<xref topicid="653081" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645766">Yeshiva University</xref>
in 1945. The eastern European Orthodox elements concentrated primarily on Jewish education, and it was they who introduced the movement for Jewish day schools, analogous to Christian parochial schools. Gradually, an American version of Orthodoxy developed on the Neo-Orthodox model of 
<xref topicid="266851" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Samson Raphael Hirsch</xref>
(1808–88), which combined institutional separatism with a certain openness to general culture. 
</p>


-<p>
The immigrants and their children had three desires: to advance socially by joining older congregations or forming their own in an Americanized image, to affirm an unideological commitment to Jewish life, and to maintain their ties to the overseas Jewish communities of their origin. With their strong sense of Jewish personhood, they introduced Zionism into American Jewish life and accepted the basic ideas of the 
<xref topicid="493759" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1605704">Reconstructionism</xref>
of 
<xref topicid="311762" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645768">Mordecai Kaplan</xref>
(1881–1983), which was committed to Zionism. A small group of anti-Zionists remained a significant force in the 1930s and ’40s, but their central organization, the American Council for Judaism, represented the descendants of earlier German Jewish immigrants. The later immigrants took over all the earlier institutions of the Jewish community and imbued them with their own spirit. 
</p>


-<p>
American Jewish religious life is a continuum, from the most traditional Orthodoxy to the most radical 
<xref topicid="493759" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659179">Reconstructionism</xref>
. In theory, all 
<xref topicid="433416" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659181">Orthodox</xref>
groups agree on the revealed nature of all of Jewish law. For 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659180">Reform</xref>
groups, the moral doctrine of Judaism is divine and its ritual law is man-made; 
<xref topicid="133461" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659182">Conservatives</xref>
see Judaism as the working out in both areas of a divine revelation that is incarnate in a slowly changing human history; and the Reconstructionists (who also include some Conservative and Reform Jews) view Judaism as the evolving civilization created by the Jewish people in the light of its highest conscience. The role of the rabbi is substantially the same in all three groups: no longer a Talmudic scholar but a preacher, pastor, and administrator, a cross between a parish priest and the leader of an 
<xref topicid="194248" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ethnic group</xref>
. Religious life for the three major Jewish denominations—Orthodox, Reform, and Conservative—revolves around the individual synagogue and the denomination to which it belongs. As religious identification has become increasingly respectable in American life, the Jews have followed the American norm, affiliating in greater numbers with synagogues, though often for ethnic or social rather than religious reasons.

Modernity came first to the Jewish people of 
<xref topicid="195686" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Europe</xref>
. It was therefore within the European context that representatives of important non-Ashkenazi communities—such as the proto-Zionist

Judah ben Solomon Ḥai Alkalai (1798–1878) of Sarajevo and the Luzzatto family and Elijah Benamozegh (1822–1900) in Italy—participated in variations of Jewish modernity. In England and France more so than in Germany or Russia, the central focus of Jewish experience was 
<e>Wissenschaft des Judentums</e>
, with its Enlightenment ideology; there the “republic of scholarship” became the synagogue of the Jewish intelligentsia. In neither country did Reform Judaism gain a major foothold, for the Orthodox establishment liberalized its synagogue practice while retaining its essentially conservative outlook. In Anglo-Jewish life in the last decades of the 19th century, the two most pronounced modernist tendencies were the moderate, romantic traditionalism of 
<xref topicid="527093" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1605708">Solomon Schechter</xref>
(1847–1915) and the “renewed Karaism” of 
<xref topicid="390695" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Claude Joseph Goldsmid Montefiore</xref>
(1858–1938), whose version of religious reform was “back to the Bible.” 
</p>


-<p>
In 
<xref topicid="555844" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">South America</xref>
and Canada, Jewish modernity appeared late, for European Jewry arrived in those places even later than in the United States, attaining significant numbers only in the 20th century. These communities were dependent on immigrant scholars and intellectuals for serious Jewish thought. Jews in the Arab lands in 
<xref topicid="418538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North Africa</xref>
and the 
<xref topicid="381192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle East</xref>
, living in traditional societies, entered modernity even later than those on the peripheries of Europe. Many of them received their first introduction to the Western world in schools set up by the Alliance Israélite Universelle (a Jewish defense organization centred in Paris), which combined Jewish education with the language and values of French civilization. Yet most of these communities remained traditionalist almost up to the moment when they were expelled or felt compelled to relocate, beginning in 1948, when the State of Israel was created. The ferment of modernity in all its forms is now being felt in their ranks. In Israel, which has received a large segment of Sephardic Jewry, the attention of these communities has turned to gaining equality with the more advanced Ashkenazim rather than to developing forms of modern Jewish thought.

<headtitle>Contemporary Judaism</headtitle>


-<p>
As a result of the 
<xref topicid="269548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holocaust</xref>
, Judaism has become a non-European religion; its three major centres, which together include more than three-fourths of world Jewry, are 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israel</xref>
, the Slavic region of the former 
<xref topicid="614785" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Soviet Union</xref>
, and the 
<xref topicid="616563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">United States</xref>
. Although Jews constitute only a small fraction of the population of the United States, Judaism plays an important role in American life; with Roman Catholicism and Protestantism it is regarded as one of the major American faiths. Similarly, in the international realm of Western religion, Judaism has been welcomed as a partner able to deal with other major religions as an equal on issues such as anti-Semitism, 
<xref topicid="275840" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human rights</xref>
, and world peace. 
</p>

<p>Within its own community, Jewry is faced with the increasing secularization of Jewish identity in its three major centres, each in its own way. In the United States the open society and the “melting pot” ideologies of past generations have fostered among many Jews a sense of Jewish identity increasingly devoid of concrete religious, national, or historical content; in the former Soviet Union, government policy from the 1930s had banned the teaching of Judaism and Jewish culture to the young and had severely discouraged any manifestation of Jewish identity as a sign of the political disloyalty of “rootless cosmopolitans”; and in Israel a secular nationalism has taken root, raising questions about the role that Judaism plays in the identity of the average Israeli.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, underneath the external secularization there are signs of a deep and persisting religious fervour, in which the sense of history, community, and personal authenticity figure as the intertwined strands of Jewish religious life, especially as it has been affected by the State of Israel. Some of the rituals of the Jewish tradition, especially the rites of passage at the crucial stages of individual existence, are almost universally observed; in the United States, for example, more than 80 percent of Jewish children receive some formal religious training. Among Jewish youth there is, in some circles, a quest for tradition. In the United States, Jewish communes have been established that seek new forms of Jewish expression; in Israel, groups such as Mevaqshe Derekh (“Seekers of the Way”) have tried to bridge secular Israeli culture and Jewish tradition and to maintain traditional Jewish ethical standards even in wartime; in Russia, thousands of young people gather on several occasions of the year to dance and sing and express solidarity in front of the synagogues in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Still, signs of major weaknesses persist. The rate of intermarriage among Jews in the Diaspora has increased, while regular synagogue attendance, at the very highest 20 percent in the United States, remains far below church attendance.</p>


-<p>
Despite their lack of traditional piety, there is a general sense among Jews that they remain Jews not because of the force of anti-Semitism but because of the attractiveness of their tradition and their sense of a common history and destiny. Although in 1945 the world Jewish community, decimated and horrified by the Holocaust, felt in danger of disappearing, there appeared to be no such despair in the last quarter of the century, when there was an expectation that Jewish communal feeling would remain strong—especially, for many or most Jews, in light of the existence of the State of Israel. Judaism enjoyed a heightened dignity in the eyes of the world, not only because of the creation of the State of Israel but also because of Judaism’s close relations with other world religions. Although the recurring phenomenon of the alienation of young Jews from their tradition was troubling, it was no more so than in recent past generations. Along with other major religions, Judaism’s most disturbing problem was how to deal with secular ideologies and the growth of 
<xref topicid="532006" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">secularism</xref>
within its own ranks. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, it appeared that Judaism would have to contend with as many problems as the other major religions did, but it would face them with no less confidence—and with more confidence than it had felt at the start of the previous century.

<headtitle>General considerations</headtitle>


-<p>
A paradigmatic statement is made in the narrative that begins with 
<xref topicid="228795" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Genesis</xref>
and ends with 
<xref topicid="306505" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Joshua</xref>
. In the early chapters of Genesis, the divine is described as the creator of humankind and the entire natural order. In the stories of Eden, the Flood, and the 
<xref topicid="47421" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636314">Tower of Babel</xref>
, humans are recognized as rebellious and disobedient. In the patriarchal stories (about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph), a particular family is called upon to restore the relationship between God and humankind. The subsequent history of the community thus formed is recounted so that God’s desired restoration may be recognized and the nature of the obedient community may be observed by his people: the Egyptian servitude, the Exodus from Egypt, the revelation of the “teaching,” the wandering years, and finally fulfillment through entrance into the “land” (Canaan). The prophetic books (in the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
these include the historical narratives up to the Babylonian Exile—i.e., Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) also address the tension between rebellion and obedience, interpreting it within the changing historical context and adding new levels of meaning to the motif of fulfillment and redemption. 
</p>

<p>From this “narrative theology,” as it has been recited throughout the centuries, new formulations of the primal affirmations have been drawn. These have been clothed in philosophical, mystical, ethnic, and political vocabularies, among others. The emphases have been various, the disagreements often profound. No single exposition has exhausted the possibilities of the affirmations or of the relationship between them. Philosophers have expounded them on the highest level of abstraction, using the language of the available philosophical systems. Mystics have enveloped them in the extravagant prose of speculative systems and in simple folktales. Attempts have been made to encompass them in theoretical ethical statements and to express them through practical ethical behaviour. Yet, in each instance, the proposed interpretations have had to come to terms with the spiritual and intellectual demands arising out of the community’s experience. The biblical texts, themselves the products of a long period of transmission and embodying more than a single outlook, were subjected to extensive study and interpretation over many centuries and, when required, were translated into other languages. The whole literature remains the basis of further developments, so that any attempt to formulate a statement of the affirmations of Judaism must, however contemporary it seeks to be, give heed to the scope and variety of speculation and formulation in the past.</p>

Sources and scope of the 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Torah</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
The concept “Giver of Torah” played a central role in the understanding of God, for it is 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619759">Torah</xref>
, or “Teaching,” that confirms the events recognized by the community as the acts of God. In its written form, Torah was considered to be especially present in the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch), which themselves came to be called Torah. In addition to this written Torah, or “Law,” there were also unwritten laws or customs and interpretations of them, carried down in an oral tradition over many generations, which acquired the status of oral Torah. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<xref topicid="212142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">oral tradition</xref>
interpreted the written Torah, adapted its precepts to ever-changing political and social circumstances, and supplemented it with new legislation. Thus, the oral tradition added a dynamic dimension to the written code, making it a perpetual process rather than a closed system. The vitality of this tradition is fully demonstrated in the way the ancient laws were adapted after the destruction of the Temple in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
and by the role played by the 
<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619760">Talmud</xref>
in the survival of the Jewish people in exile. By the 11th century, 
<xref topicid="161756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619761">Diaspora</xref>
Jews lived in a Talmudic culture that united them and that superseded geographical boundaries and language differences. Jewish communities governed themselves according to Talmudic law, and individuals regulated the smallest details of their lives by it. 
</p>


-<p>
Central to this vast structure was, of course, the Jewish community’s concern to live in accordance with the divine will as it was embodied and expressed in Torah in the widest sense. Scripture, Halakhic and Haggadic Midrash, Mishna, and 
<xref topicid="228041" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Gemara</xref>
were the sources that Jewish leaders used to give their communities stability and flexibility. Jewish communities and individuals of the Diaspora faced novel and unexpected situations that had to be dealt with in ways that would provide continuity while making it possible to exist with the unprecedented. 
</p>


-<h4 tocid="35232">

<headtitle>Prophecy and religious experience</headtitle>


-<p>
Torah in the broad sense includes the whole Hebrew Bible, including the books of the Prophets. According to the Prophets, God was revealed in the nexus of historical events and made ethical demands upon the community. In 
<xref topicid="487890" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rabbinic Judaism</xref>
the role of the prophet—the charismatic person—as a source of Torah ended in the period of Ezra (i.e., about the time of the return from the Babylonian Exile in the 5th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). This opinion may have been a reaction to the luxuriant growth of apocalyptic speculation, a development that was considered dangerous and unsettling in the period after the 
<xref topicid="52477" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619762">Bar Kokhba</xref>
revolt, or 
<xref topicid="303635" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Second Jewish Revolt</xref>
(132–135 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
). Indeed, there seems to have developed a suspicion that reliance on unrestrained individual experience as a source of Torah was inimical to the welfare of the community. Such an attitude was by no means new. Deuteronomy (13:2–19) had already warned against such “misleaders.” The culmination of this attitude is to be found in a Talmudic narrative in which even the 
<e>bat qol</e>
, the divine “echo” that announces God’s will, is ignored on a particular occasion. Related to this is the reluctance on the part of teachers in the early centuries of the Common Era to point to wonders and miracles in their own time. Far from expressing an ossification of religious experience—the development of the 
<xref topicid="542941" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">siddur</xref>
(prayer book) and the Talmudic reports on the devotional life of the rabbis contradict such an interpretation—the attitude seems to be a response to the development of religious enthusiasm such as that exhibited in the behaviour of the Christian church in Corinth—as Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians reveals—and among gnostic sects and sectarians. Thus, even among the speculative mystics of the Middle Ages, where allegorization of Scripture abounds, the structure of the community and the obligations of the individual are not displaced by the deepening of personal religious life through mystical experience. The decisive instance of this is 
<xref topicid="312602" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636210">Joseph Karo</xref>
(1488–1575), who was thought to be in touch with a supernal guide but who was at the same time the author of an important codification of Jewish law, the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="542287" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shulḥan ʿarukh</xref>

</e>
. 
</p>

<p>Admittedly, there have been occasions when Torah, even in the wide sense, has been rigidly applied. In certain historical situations the dynamic process of Rabbinic Judaism has been treated as a static structure. What is of greater significance, however, is the way in which this tendency toward inflexibility has been reversed by the inherent dynamism of the rabbinic tradition.</p>

<headtitle>Modern views of Torah</headtitle>


-<p>
Since the end of the 18th century, the traditional position has been challenged both in detail and in principle. The rise of 
<xref topicid="197930" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">biblical criticism</xref>
has raised a host of questions about the origins and development of Scripture and thus about the very concept of Torah, in the senses in which it has functioned in Judaism. Naturalistic views of God have required a reinterpretation of Torah in sociological terms. Other positions of many sorts have been and undoubtedly will be forthcoming. What is crucial, however, is the concern of all these positions to retain the concept of Torah as one of the central and continuing affirmations of Judaism.

<headtitle>Basic beliefs and doctrines</headtitle>


-<p>

<xref topicid="590855" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Judaism</xref>
is more than an abstract intellectual system, though there have been many efforts to view it systematically. It affirms divine sovereignty disclosed in creation (nature) and in history, without necessarily insisting upon—but at the same time not rejecting—metaphysical speculation about the divine. It insists that the community has been confronted by the divine not as an abstraction but as a person with whom the community and its members have entered into a relationship. It is, as the concept of Torah indicates, a program of human action, rooted in this personal confrontation. Further, the response of this particular people to its encounter with God is viewed as significant for all humankind. The community is called upon to express its loyalty to God and the covenant by exhibiting solidarity within its corporate life on every level, including every aspect of 
<xref topicid="275332" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human behaviour</xref>
, from the most public to the most private. Thus, even Jewish 
<xref topicid="649187" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">worship</xref>
is a communal celebration of the meetings with God in history and in nature. Yet the particular existence of the covenant people is thought of not as contradicting but rather as enhancing human solidarity. This people, together with all humanity, is called upon to institute political, economic, and social forms that will affirm divine sovereignty. This task is carried out in the belief not that humans will succeed in these endeavours solely by their own efforts but that these sought-after human relationships have their source and their goal in God, who assures their actualization. Within the community, each Jew is called upon to realize the covenant in his or her personal intention and behaviour. 
</p>

<p>In considering the basic affirmations of Judaism from this point of view, it is best to allow indigenous formulations rather than systematic statements borrowed from other traditions to govern the presentation.</p>


-<h3 tocid="35235">

<headtitle>God</headtitle>


-<p>
An early statement of basic beliefs and doctrines about God emerged in the liturgy of the synagogue some time during the last pre-Christian and first Christian centuries; there is some evidence to suggest that such formulations were not absent from the Temple cult that came to an end in the year 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. A section of the 
<xref topicid="542941" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">siddur</xref>
that focuses on the recitation of a series of biblical passages (Deuteronomy 6:4–9; Deuteronomy 11:13–21; Numbers 15:37–41) is named for the first of these, 
<xref topicid="539803" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636225">Shema</xref>
(“Hear”): “Hear, O Israel! the Lord is our God, the Lord alone” (or “…the Lord our God, the Lord is one”). In the Shema—often regarded as the Jewish confession of faith, or creed—the biblical material and accompanying benedictions are arranged to provide a statement about God’s relationship with the world and Israel (the Jewish people), as well as about Israel’s obligations toward and response to God. In this statement, God—the creator of the universe who has chosen Israel in love (“Blessed art thou, O Lord, who has chosen thy people Israel in love”) and showed this love by the giving of Torah—is declared to be “one.” His love is to be reciprocated by those who lovingly obey Torah and whose obedience is rewarded and rebellion punished. The goal of this obedience is God’s “redemption” of Israel, a role foreshadowed by his action in bringing Israel out of Egypt. 
</p>


-<h4 tocid="35236">

<headtitle>Unity and uniqueness</headtitle>


-<p>
At the centre of this liturgical formulation of belief is the concept of 
<xref topicid="390101" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">divine singularity</xref>
and uniqueness. In its original setting, it may have served as the theological statement of the reform under 
<xref topicid="306538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Josiah</xref>
, king of Judah, in the 7th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
, when worship was centred exclusively in Jerusalem and all other cultic centres were rejected, so that the existence of one shrine only was understood as affirming one deity. The idea acquired further meaning, however. It was understood toward the end of the pre-Christian era to proclaim the unity of divine love and divine justice, as expressed in the divine names YHWH and Elohim, respectively. A further expansion of this affirmation is found in the first two benedictions of this liturgical section, which together proclaim that the God who is the creator of the universe and the God who is Israel’s ruler and lawgiver are one and the same—as opposed to the dualistic religious positions of the Greco-Roman world, which insisted that the creator God and the lawgiver God are separate and even inimical. This affirmation was developed in philosophical and mystical terms by both medieval and modern thinkers.

<headtitle>Creativity</headtitle>

This “creed,” or “confession of faith,” underscores in the first benediction the relation of God to the world as that of creator to creation. “Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who forms light and creates darkness, who makes peace and creates all things.” It adds the assertion that his activity is not in the past but is ongoing and continuous, for “he makes new continually, each day, the work of creation”; thus, unlike the deity of the

The change was clearly made to avoid the implication that God is the source of moral evil. Judaism, however, did not ignore the problem of pain and suffering in the world; it affirmed the paradox of suffering and divine sovereignty, of pain and divine providence, refusing to accept the concept of a God that is Lord over only the harmonious and pleasant aspects of reality.

<headtitle>Activity in the world</headtitle>


-<p>
The second and the third benedictions deal with divine activity within the realm of history and human life. God is the teacher of all humanity; he has chosen the people of Israel in love to witness to his presence and his desire for a perfected society; he will, as redeemer, enable humanity to experience that perfection. These activities, together with creation itself, are understood to express divine compassion and kindness as well as justice (judgment), recognizing the sometimes paradoxical relation between them. Taken together, they disclose 
<xref topicid="480634" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Divine Providence</xref>
—God’s continual activity in the world. The constant renewal of creation (nature) is itself an act of compassion overriding strict justice and affording humankind further opportunity to fulfill the divinely appointed obligation. 
</p>


-<p>
The basically moral nature of God is asserted in the second of the biblical passages that form the core of this liturgical statement (Deuteronomy 11:13–21). Here, in the language of its agricultural setting, the community is promised reward for obedience and punishment for disobedience. The intention of the passage is clear: obedience is rewarded by the preservation of order, so that the community and its members find wholeness in life; while disobedience—rebellion against divine sovereignty—shatters order, so that the community is overwhelmed by adversity. The passage of time has made the original language unsatisfactory (promising rain, crops, and 
<xref topicid="202365" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">fat</xref>
cattle), but the basic principle remains, affirming that, however difficult it is to recognize the fact, there is a divine law and judge. Support for this affirmation is drawn from the third biblical passage (Numbers 15:37–41), which explains that the 
<xref topicid="581625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">fringes</xref>
the Israelites are commanded to wear on the corners of their garments are reminders to observe the commandments of God, who brought forth Israel from Egyptian bondage. The theme of divine redemption is elaborated in the concluding benediction to point toward a future in which the as-yet-fragmentary rule of God will be brought to completion: “Blessed is his name whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.” 
</p>

-<h4 tocid="35239">

<headtitle>Otherness and nearness</headtitle>


-<p>
Within this complex of ideas, other themes are interwoven. In the concept of the divine creator there is a somewhat impersonal or remote quality—of a power above and apart from the world—which is emphasized by expressions such as the trifold declaration of God’s holiness, or divine otherness, in Isaiah 6:3: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts….” The development of surrogate divine names for biblical usage, as well as the substitution of Adonai (“my Lord”) for the tetragrammaton (
<xref topicid="651183" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">YHWH</xref>
) in the reading of the Bible itself, suggests an acute awareness of the otherness of God. Yet the belief in the transcendence of God is mirrored by the affirmation of God’s immanence. In the biblical narrative it is God himself who is the directly active participant in events, an idea that is emphasized in the liturgical narrative (Haggada; “Storytelling”) recited during the Passover meal (seder): “and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt—not by an angel, and not by a seraph, and not by a messenger….” The surrogate divine name 
<xref topicid="539592" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659183">Shekhina</xref>
, “Presence” (i.e., the presence of God in the world), is derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to dwell,” again calling attention to divine nearness. The relationship between these two affirmations, otherness and nearness, is expressed in a Midrashic statement, “in every place that divine awesome majesty is mentioned in Scripture, divine abasement is spoken of, too.” 
</p>


-<p>
Closely connected with these ideas is the concept of divine personhood, most particularly illustrated in the use of the pronoun “thou” in direct address to God. The community and the individual, confronted by the creator, teacher, and redeemer, address the divine as a living person, not as a theological abstraction. The basic liturgical form, the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="61446" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">berakha</xref>

</e>
(“blessing”), is usually couched in the second person singular: “Blessed art thou….” This relationship, through which remoteness is overcome and presentness is established, illuminates creation, Torah, and redemption, for it reveals the meaning of love. From it flow the various possibilities of expressing the divine-human relationship in personal, intimate language. Sometimes, especially in mystical thought, such language becomes extravagant, foreshadowed by vivid biblical metaphors such as the husband-wife relation in Hosea, the “adoption” motif in Ezekiel 16, and the firstborn-son relation in Exodus 4:22. Nonetheless, although terms of personal intimacy are used widely to express Israel’s relationship with God, such usage is restrained by the accompanying sense of divine otherness. This is evident in the liturgical “blessings,” where, following the direct address to God in which the second person singular pronoun is used, the verbs are with great regularity in the third person singular, thus providing the requisite tension between nearness and otherness, between the personal and the impersonal.

<headtitle>Modern views of God</headtitle>

The Judaic affirmations about God have not always been given the same emphasis, nor have they been understood in the same way. This was true in the Middle Ages, among both philosophers and mystics, as well as in modern times. In the 19th century, western European Jewish thinkers attempted to express and transform these affirmations in terms of German philosophical

-<p>
The concluding phrase of the second benediction of the liturgical section—“who has 
<xref topicid="114629" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chosen thy people Israel</xref>
in love”—clearly states that God’s choice to establish a relationship with Israel in particular was determined by divine love. The patriarchal narratives, beginning with the 12th chapter of Genesis, presuppose the choice, which is set forth explicitly in 
<xref topicid="159740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Deuteronomy</xref>
7:6–8 in the New Jewish Version:

-<qt>

<qtpara>For you are a people consecrated to the Lord your God: of all the peoples on earth the Lord your God chose you to be His treasured people. It is not because you are the most numerous of peoples that the Lord set His heart on you and chose you—indeed you are the smallest of peoples; but it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath He made with your fathers that the Lord freed you with a mighty hand and rescued you from the house of bondage, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</qtpara>

The background of this choice is the recurring disobedience of humankind narrated in 
<xref topicid="228795" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Genesis</xref>
2–11 (the stories of 
<xref topicid="4992" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636312">Adam and Eve</xref>
, Cain and Abel, 
<xref topicid="416799" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1636313">Noah</xref>
, and the Tower of Babel). In the subsequent chapters of Genesis, 
<xref topicid="1544" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Abraham</xref>
and his descendants are singled out not merely as the object of the divine blessing but also as its channel to all humanity. The choice, however, demands a reciprocal response from Abraham and his lineage. That response is obedience, as exemplified in the first instance by Abraham’s readiness to leave his “native land” and his “father’s house” (Genesis 12:1). This twofold relationship was formalized in a mutually binding agreement, a covenant between the two parties. The covenant, thought by some modern biblical scholars to reflect the form of ancient suzerainty treaties, indicates (as in the Ten Utterances, or Decalogue) the source of Israel’s obligation—the acts of God in history—and the specific requirements those acts impose. The formalization of this relationship was accomplished by certain cultic acts that, according to some contemporary scholars, may have been performed on a regular basis at various sacred sites in the land before being centralized in Jerusalem. The content of the covenantal obligations thus formalized was Torah. Israel was bound in obedience, and Israel’s failure to obey provided the occasions for the prophetic messages. The prophets, as spokespersons for God, called the community to renewed obedience, threatened and promised disaster if obedience was not forthcoming, and sought to explain the covenant’s persistence even when it should have been repudiated by God. 
</p>


-<p>
The choice of Israel is expressed in concrete terms in the requirements of the precepts (

-<e>

<xref topicid="386361" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">mitzwot</xref>
, 
</e>
singular 
<e>mitzwa</e>
) that are part of Torah. The blessing recited before the public reading of the pentateuchal portions on Sabbath, festivals, holy days, fasts, and certain weekdays refers to God as “He who chose us from among all the peoples and gave us His Torah,” thus emphasizing the intimate relationship between the elective and revelatory aspects of God. 
</p>


-<p>
Israel’s role was not defined solely in terms of its own obedience to the commandments. Abraham and his descendants, for example, were seen as the means by which the estrangement of disobedient humankind from God was to be overcome. Torah was the formative principle underlying the community’s fulfillment of this obligation. Israel was to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6) functioning within humanity and for its sake. This task is enunciated with particular earnestness in the writings of the Prophets. In 
<xref topicid="295147" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Isaiah</xref>
43–44, Israel is declared to be God’s witness and servant, who is to bring the knowledge of God to the nations, and in 42:6–7 it is described as a “covenant of the people, to be a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prisons, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.” This double motif of a chosen people and a witness to the nations, joined to that of the righteous king, developed in the biblical and postbiblical periods into messianism in its several varieties. 
</p>

<p>The intimate relation between choice, covenant, and Torah determined the modality of Israel’s existence. Religious faith, far from being restricted to or encapsulated in the cult, found expression in the totality of communal and individual life. The obligation of the people was to be the true community, in which the relationship between its members was open, in which social distance was repudiated, and in which response to the divine will expressed in Torah was called for equally from all. One of the important recurring themes of the prophetic movement was the adamant rejection of any tendency to limit divine sovereignty to the partial area of “religion,” understood as the realm of the priesthood and cult. Subsequent developments continued this theme, though it appeared in a number of other forms. Pharisaic Judaism and its continuation, Rabbinic Judaism, resolutely held to the idea of the all-pervasive functioning of Torah, so that however the various Jewish communities over the centuries may have failed to fulfill this idea, the self-image of the people was that of a “holy community.”</p>

</h4>


-<h4 tocid="35243">

<headtitle>Israel and the nations</headtitle>


-<p>
The double motif of “treasured people” and “witness” was not without its tensions as it functioned in ongoing history. Tensions are especially visible in the period following the return from the 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Exile</xref>
at the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 5th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
. It is, however, doubtful whether the use of such terms as nationalism, particularism, or exclusivism are of any great help in understanding the situation. Emphasis has, for example, been laid upon Ezra 9:2 and 10:2, in which the reestablished community is commanded to give up wives taken from “the peoples of the land.” This is taken as an indication of the exclusive and nationalistic nature of Judaism, without reference to the situation in which a harassed contingent of returning exiles sought to maintain itself in a territory surrounded by politically unfriendly if not hostile neighbours. Nor does this recognize that foreigners were admitted to the Jewish community; in the following centuries, some groups engaged in extensive missionary activities, appealing to the individuals of the nations surrounding them to join themselves to the God of Israel, the one true God and the creator of heaven and earth. 
</p>

<p>A more balanced view recognizes that, within the Jewish community, religious universalism was affirmed by the same people who understood the nature of Jewish existence in politically particularistic (i.e., nationalistic) terms. To neglect either side is to distort the picture. In no case was the universalism disengaged from the reality of the existing community, even when it was expressed in terms of the ultimate fulfillment of the divine purpose, the restoration of the true covenantal relationship between God and all humankind. Nor was political particularism, even under circumstances of great provocation and resentment, misanthropic. The most satisfactory figure in describing the situation of the restored community, and one that continues to be useful in dealing with later episodes, is that of the human heartbeat, made up of two functions, the systole, or contraction, and the diastole, or expansion. There have been several periods of contraction and of expansion throughout the history of Judaism. The emphasis within the abiding tension has been determined by the historical situation in which the community has found itself. To generalize in one direction or the other is fatal to an understanding of the history and faith of the “holy community.”</p>

<headtitle>The people and the land</headtitle>


-<p>
Closely related to the concept of 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israel</xref>
as the chosen, or covenant, people is the role of the land of Israel. In the patriarchal stories, settlement in Canaan is an integral part of God’s fulfillment of the covenant. The goal of the Israelites who escaped from Egypt and of those who returned from the Babylonian Exile is the same land, and entry into it is understood in the same fashion. As there was the choice of a people, so there was the choice of a land—and for much the same reason. It was to provide the setting in which the community could come into being as it carried out the divine commandments. This choice of the land contrasts significantly with the predominant ideas of other peoples in the ancient world, in which the deity or divinities were usually bound to a particular parcel of ground outside of which they lost their effectiveness or reality. Although some such concepts may very well have crept into Israelite thought during the period of the kings (from Saul to Jehoiachin), the crisis of the Babylonian Exile was met by a renewal of the affirmation that the God of Israel was, as Lord of all the earth, free from territorial restraint, though he had chosen a particular territory for this chosen people. Here again the twofold nature of Jewish thought becomes apparent, and both sides must be affirmed or the view is distorted. 
</p>


-<p>
Following the two revolts against Rome (66–73 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
and 132–135 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), the Jews of the ever-widening dispersion continued, as they had before these disasters, to cherish the land. Once again it became the symbol of fulfillment, so that return to it was looked upon as an essential part of messianic restoration. The liturgical patterns of the community, insofar as they were concerned with natural phenomena (e.g., planting, rainfall, harvest, and the annual cycle) rather than historical events, were based on geography, topography, and agricultural practices of the land. Although some Jews continued to live in the land, those in the distant dispersion idealized it, viewing it primarily in eschatological terms—their destination at the end of days, in the world to come. The 11th-century poet 
<xref topicid="307174" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1767294">Judah ha-Levi</xref>
not only longed for it in verse but also gave it a significant role in his theological interpretation of Judaism and eventually sought to return to it from his native Spain. 
</p>


-<p>
It was not, however, until the 19th century that the land began to play a role other than the goal of pilgrimage or of occasional settlement by pietists and mystics. At the end of the 19th century the power of the territorial concept was released in eastern Europe in a cultural renaissance that focused, in part, on a return to the land and, in western and central Europe, in a political movement coloured by 
<xref topicid="405644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">nationalist motifs</xref>
in European thought. The coming together of these two strains of thought gave rise to 
<xref topicid="657475" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619779">Zionism</xref>
. This predominantly political movement reflected a dissatisfaction with the overall status of the Jewish people in the modern world. 
</p>


-<p>
The political emphasis of Zionism aroused considerable opposition from three competing views of the status of the Jewish people. The first opposition came from some traditionalist Jews (now called “
<xref topicid="433416" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1619780">Orthodox</xref>
” or “ultra-Orthodox”) who were convinced that the Jewish nation must remain a solely religious community in the Diaspora and even in the land of Israel. They accepted the political rule of the Gentiles until the time when God will send his messiah to redeem the Jewish people by supernaturally returning all of them to the land of Israel in order to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. 
</p>


-<p>
The second opposition came from acculturated Jews in western Europe and 
<xref topicid="418612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North America</xref>
who believed that Jews are part of larger secular polities and that their role in them should be that of a communion of like-minded religious believers, similar to that of the Catholic and Protestant denominations. 
</p>


-<p>
The third opposition came from some eastern European Jews who maintained that the Jewish people should seek their own national status in the territories in which they were presently living, similar to the resurgence of nationalism among a number of smaller nations living under the Austro-Hungarian or Russian empires. It was not until the Nazi 
<xref topicid="269548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holocaust</xref>
in the middle of the 20th century that the vast majority of Jews regarded Zionism, if not as the solution to the “Jewish question,” then as something the Jews could not very well survive without. After this time, Jewish opposition to Zionism was confined to peripheral groups on the right who still saw Zionism as pseudo-messianism and to peripheral groups on the left who still saw Zionism as isolating Jews from more important universalist goals.

<headtitle>Modern views of the people Israel</headtitle>


-<p>
The nature of the people Israel and of the land of Israel has been variously interpreted in the history of Jewish thought. In modern times some interpretations have been deeply influenced by contemporary political and social discussions in the general community. Thus, for example, Zionist theoreticians were influenced by concepts of political nationalism on the one hand and by socialist ideas on the other. Further, the challenge to traditional theological concepts in the 19th century raised issues about the meaning of the choice of Israel, and Jewish thinkers borrowed from romantic nationalism ideas such as the “genius” of the people. In the 20th century, attempts were made to approach the question sociologically, dismissing the theological mode as unhelpful. The concept of the chosen people was accordingly understood as indicating a specific role deliberately undertaken by the Jewish people and similar to that espoused by other groups (e.g., 
<xref topicid="362216" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645889">manifest destiny</xref>
by the American people). The establishment of the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">State of Israel</xref>
motivated some thinkers to call for a repudiation of the idea, in keeping with the position that normal existence for the Jews requires the dismissal of such concepts. Although only a small minority of Jewish thinkers espoused this position, the concept of the choice of Israel was not without theological difficulties. In the late 20th century there were also some important attempts by Jewish thinkers to develop a theology of election. 
</p>


-<p>
The most important scholarship on the concept of “
<xref topicid="114629" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chosenness</xref>
” was Michael Wyschogrod’s 
<e>The Body of Faith</e>
(1983) and David Novak’s 
<e>The Election of Israel</e>
(1995). Wyschogrod held that the people of Israel were elected because of God’s exceptional love for them and that God’s love existed prior to the revelation to Moses on 
<xref topicid="545577" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mount Sinai</xref>
. Novak also accepted the traditional belief that God formed a unique relationship with Israel but maintained that God extends his covenant to the world and that the particularity of Israel’s election is implicated in the general covenant with the world and vice versa.

1:26, 27; 5:1; and 9:6 two terms occur, “image” and “likeness,” that seem to indicate clearly the biblical understanding of essential human nature: humans are created in the image and likeness of God. Yet the texts in which these terms are used are not entirely unambiguous; the idea they point to does not appear elsewhere in Scriptures, and the concept is not too prominent in the rabbinic interpretations. What the image and likeness of God, or the divine image, refers to in the biblical texts is not made explicit, and, in light of the fact that the texts are dominated by psychosomatic conceptions of the nature of humanity (i.e., involving both soul and body), it is not possible to escape entirely the implication of “bodily” similarity. What the terms meant in their context at the time and whether they reflect mythological usages taken over from other Middle Eastern thought are by no means certain. However, according to

<headtitle>The earthly-spiritual creature</headtitle>


-<p>
A 
<xref topicid="172631" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">dualistic interpretation</xref>
of humanity was offered in parts of the ancient Jewish community that were deeply influenced by Greek philosophical ideas. In this understanding, the divine likeness is identified with the immortal, intellectual soul as contrasted to the body. Other ancient and modern thinkers have understood the likeness as ethical, placing particular emphasis on freedom of the will. Clearly, no doctrine of humanity can be erected on the basis of these several verses alone—a broader view must be taken. A careful examination of the biblical material, particularly the words 
<e>nefesh</e>
, 
<e>neshama</e>
, and 
<e>ruaḥ</e>
—which are often too broadly translated as “
<xref topicid="555149" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">soul</xref>
” and “spirit”—indicates that these terms must not be understood as referring to the psychical side of a psychophysical pair. A 
<xref topicid="275376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human being</xref>
does not possess a 
<e>nefesh</e>
but rather is a 
<e>nefesh</e>
, as Genesis 2:7 says, “wayehi ha-adam le-nefesh ḥayya” (“…and the man became a living being”). Humans are, for most of the biblical writers, “a unit of vital power,” not a dual creature separable into two distinct parts of unequal importance and value. While this understanding of 
<xref topicid="275811" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human nature</xref>
dominated biblical thought, in apocalyptic literature (2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
–2nd century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) the term 
<e>nefesh</e>
was viewed as a separable psychical entity with existence apart from the body. This conception of human nature was not entirely divorced from the unitary biblical view, but a body-soul dualism (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="383566" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645842">mind-body dualism</xref>
) was effectively present in such literature. In the Alexandrian version of Hellenistic Judaism, the orientation toward Greek philosophy, particularly the Platonic view of the soul imprisoned in the flesh, led to a clear-cut dualism with a negative attitude toward the body. Rabbinic thought remained closer to the biblical position, at least in its understanding of the human being as a psychosomatic unit, even though the temporary separation of the components after 
<xref topicid="154412" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">death</xref>
was an accepted position. 
</p>


-<p>
The biblical view of the human as an inseparable psychosomatic unit meant that death was understood to be human dissolution. Although a human being ceased to be, this dissolution was not utter extinction. Some of the power that functioned in the unit may have continued to exist, but it was not to be understood any longer as life. The existence of the dead in sheol, the netherworld, was not living but the shadow or echo of living. For most biblical writers this existence was without experience, either of God or of anything else; it was unrelated to events. To call it 
<xref topicid="283613" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1637223">immortality</xref>
is to empty that term of any vital significance. The concept of sheol, however, along with belief in the possibility of the miraculous restoration of dead individuals to life and even the idea of the revival of the people of Israel from the “death” of exile, provided a foothold for the development of belief in the 
<xref topicid="499816" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">resurrection</xref>
of the dead body at some time in the future. The stimulus for this may have come from ancient 
<xref topicid="293595" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645847">Iranian religion</xref>
, in which the dualistic cosmic struggle is eventually won by life through the resurrection of the dead. This idea appeared in sketchy form in postexilic writings (Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2). In this view there is life only in the psychosomatic unit now restored. This restoration was bound up with the eschatological hope of Israel and was limited to the righteous. In subsequent apocalyptic literature, a sharper distinction between body and soul was entertained, and the latter was conceived of as existing separately in a disembodied state after death. Although at this point the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was not put aside, the direction of thinking changed. The shades of sheol were now thought of as souls, and real personal survival—with continuity between life on earth and in sheol—was posited. Greek ideas, with their individualistic bent, influenced Jewish thought, so that the idea of a resurrection that was in some way related to a final historical consummation began to recede. True life after death was now seen as release from the bondage of the body, so that in place of or alongside of the afterlife of physical resurrection was set the afterlife of the immortal soul. 
</p>


-<p>
It was not the status of the soul, however, that concerned the biblical and rabbinic thinkers. Instead, the latter’s discussions of biblical themes emphasized the 
<xref topicid="194023" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ethical</xref>
import of the composite nature of human beings. Humans are in a state of tension or equilibrium between the two foci of creation, the “heavenly” and the “earthly.” They necessarily participate in both. But this means that they are the only creatures who can truly serve their creator, for they alone, partaking of both sides of creation, may choose between them. It is this ability to make an ethical choice that is the distinguishing mark of humans. It is not derived from the “heavenly” side but resides in the dual nature of human existence. This view is clearly not a type of body-soul dualism in which the soul is the source of good and the body the basis of evil. Such an attitude, however, did appear in some rabbinic material and was often affirmed in medieval philosophical and mystical speculations and by some of the later moralists. An important development of biblical-rabbinic ideas, these later commentaries represent authentic attempts to come to terms with other currents of thought and with the problems and uncertainties inherent within the earlier materials themselves.

<headtitle>The ethically bound creature</headtitle>

<p>Humankind is then viewed as ethically involved. The central theme of the first 11 chapters of Genesis focuses on this responsibility, for the implicit assumption of the pre-patriarchal stories is the human ability to choose between obedience and disobedience. Rabbinic Judaism, taking up the covenant-making episode between God and Noah (Genesis 9:8–17), developed it as the basis of humanity’s ethical obligation. All humanity, not merely Israel, is engaged in a covenant relationship with God, which was spelled out in explicit precepts—variously enumerated as 6, 7, or even 10 and occasionally as many as 30—that reflect general humanitarian behaviour and are intended to assure the maintenance of the natural order by the establishment of a proper human society. The covenant with Israel was meant to bring into being a community that would advance the development of this society through its own obedience and witness.</p>


-<p>
Human nature, viewed ethically, was explained in Rabbinic Judaism not only as a tension between the “heavenly” and “earthly” components but as a tension between two “impulses.” Here again, fragmentary and allusive biblical materials were developed into more-comprehensive statements. The biblical word 
<e>yetzer</e>
, for example, means “plan,” that which is formed in human minds. In the two occurrences of the word in Genesis (6:5; 8:21), the plan or formation of the human mind is described as 
<e>raʿ</e>
, perhaps “evil” in the moral sense or maybe no more than “disorderly,” “confused,” “undisciplined.” Other occurrences in the Bible do not have this modifier. Nonetheless, the Aramaic translations (Targumim) invariably replaced it with 
<e>bisha </e>
(“wicked”) wherever it occurred. Rabbinic literature created a technical term, 
<e>ha-raʿ</e>
(“the evil impulse”), to denote the source within humans of their disobedience, and subsequently the counter-term 
<e>yetzer ha-ṭov</e>
(“the good impulse”) was used to indicate humans’ obedience. These terms more clearly suggest the ethical quality of human duality, while their opposition and conflict point to human freedom and the ethical choices humans must make. Indeed, it is primarily within the realm of the ethical that Judaism posits freedom, recognizing the bound, or determined, quality of much of humans’ natural environment or physiological makeup. 
</p>


-<p>
This ethically free creature stands within the covenant relationship and may choose to be obedient or disobedient. 
<xref topicid="545534" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sin</xref>
, then, is ultimately deliberate disobedience or rebellion against the divine sovereign. This is more easily observed in relation to Israel, for it is in this connection that the central concern of Judaism is most evident and discussed in greatest detail. The covenant relationship is not limited to Israel, because, according to Judaic tradition, all humankind stands within a covenant relation to God and is commanded to be moral and just; therefore, the same choice is made universally. In technical language, the acceptance of divine sovereignty by the people of Israel and by individuals within that community is called “receiving the yoke of the kingship.” This involves intellectual commitment to a basic belief, as expressed by the Deuteronomic proclamation: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one!” It also imposes obligations regarding communal and individual behaviour. These two responses are understood to be inextricably bound, so that rejection of the divine sovereign is manifest as denial of God both intellectually and practically. It amounts to “breaking the yoke of the kingship.” In more specific terms, sin is sometimes summed up under three interrelated headings: idolatry, murder, and illicit 
<xref topicid="537102" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sexual behaviour</xref>
, each of which involves rebellion, for it involves activities that deny—if not God’s existence—his commanding relationship and the requirement of human response. Such behaviour destroys the community and sets individual against individual, thus thwarting the ultimate purpose of God, the perfected human society. 
</p>


-<p>
If humans are free to choose rebellion and to suffer its consequences, they are also able to turn back to God and to become reconciled with him. The Bible—particularly the prophetic writings—is filled with this idea, even though the term 
<e>teshuva</e>
(“turning”) came into use only in rabbinic sources. Basically, the idea grows out of the covenant: the opportunity to return to God is the result of God’s unwillingness—despite human failures—to break off the covenant relationship. Rabbinic thought assumed that even the direst warnings of utter disaster and rejection imply the possibility of turning back to God, motivated by remorse and the desire for restoration. Divine readiness and human openness are the two sides of the process of reconciliation. What was expressed in prophetic literature in relation to the immediate historical and political situation was stated in the synagogal liturgy in connection with pentateuchal and prophetic lessons and the homilies developed from them. Thus, the divine invitation was constantly being offered. Humans are called upon to atone for their rebellion by positive action in the other direction and are summoned to reconstitute wholeness in their individual and communal life. 
</p>

<p>Jewish existence, as it developed under rabbinic leadership following the two disastrous rebellions against Rome, was an attempt to reconstitute a community of faith expressed in worship in an ordered society in which the individual would live a hallowed life of response to the divine will. Although this plan was not spelled out in detail, it was probably understood to be the paradigm for the eventual reconstruction of humanity.</p>

<headtitle>Medieval and modern views of man</headtitle>


-<p>
Although the Jewish view of human nature was centrally concerned with ethics, metaphysical issues, however rudimentary in the beginning, were also included in the developing discussion. Medieval philosophers, for example, sought an accommodation between the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and the concept of the immortality of the soul. The greatest of them, 
<xref topicid="358539" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses Maimonides</xref>
(1135–1204), propounded an extremely subtle position that equated immortality with the cleaving of the human intellect to the active intellect of the universe, thus limiting it to philosophers or to those who accepted a suitable philosophical theology on faith. Little or no consensus was evident in the modern period, though the language of resurrection or immortality was still used, even when its content was uncertain. Alongside this lack of agreement, however, Judaism’s basic affirmation about human nature remained the same: a human being is to be understood, however else, as a creature who makes free ethical choices for which he is responsible.

<headtitle>The ethical emphasis of Judaism</headtitle>


-<p>
Jewish affirmations about God and humans intersect in the concept of Torah as the ordering of human existence in the direction of the divine. Humans are ethically responsible creatures who are responsive to the presence of God in nature and in history. Although this responsiveness is expressed on many levels, it is most explicitly called for within interpersonal relationships. The pentateuchal legislation sets down, albeit within the limitations of the structures of the 
<xref topicid="381267" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ancient Middle East</xref>
, the basic patterns of these relationships. The prophetic messages maintain that the failure to honour these demands is the source of social and individual disorder. Even the most exalted members of society are not free of ethical obligations, as is seen in the ethical confrontation of David by Nathan (“Thou art the man”) for seducing 
<xref topicid="55962" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Bathsheba</xref>
and arranging to have her husband killed (2 Samuel 12). 
</p>


-<p>
What is particularly striking about Jewish ethical concerns is the affirmation that God is not only the source of ethical obligation but is himself the paradigm of it. In the so-called 
<xref topicid="269252" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Code of Holiness</xref>
(
<xref topicid="338002" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Leviticus</xref>
19), imitation of divine holiness is offered as the basis of human behaviour in both the cultic-ceremonial and ethical spheres. The basic injunction, “You shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am Holy,” underlay the concern for economically vulnerable members of the community; obligations toward neighbours, hired labourers, and the physically handicapped; interfamilial relationships; and attitudes toward strangers (i.e., non-Israelites). Acceptable human behaviour was therefore “walking in all His ways” (Deuteronomy 11:22). The dialectical relation between God and man in the literary prophets also exhibits divine righteousness and divine compassion as patterns to be emulated in the life of the community. 
</p>


-<p>
This theme, 
<e>imitatio Dei</e>
(“imitation of God”), is expressed succinctly in a commentary on Deuteronomy 11:22 that answers the question of how it is possible to walk “in all His ways”: “As He is merciful and gracious, so be you merciful and gracious. As He is righteous so be you righteous. As He is holy, strive to be holy” (
<e>Sifre</e>
Deuteronomy 85a). Even more daringly, God is described as clothing the naked, nursing the sick, comforting the mourners, and burying the dead, so that human beings may recognize their own obligations. 
</p>

-<h4 tocid="35253">

<headtitle>Interpenetration of communal and individual ethics</headtitle>


-<p>
What stands out in the entire development of Jewish ethical formulations is the constant interpenetration of communal and individual obligations and concerns. A just society requires just people, and a just person functions within a just society. The concrete expression of ethical requirements in legal precepts takes place with both ends in view, so that the process of beginning the holy community and the process of forming the 
<e>ḥasid</e>
(“pious”), the person of steadfast devotion to God, are concomitant. The relationship between the two is, of course, often mediated by the historical situation, so that in some periods one or the other moves to the centre of practical interest. In particular, the end of the 
<xref topicid="307117" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Judaean state</xref>
(70–135 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) truncated the communal aspect of ethical obligations, often limiting discussion to apolitical responsibilities rather than to the full range of social involvements. The reestablishment of the State of Israel in the 20th century therefore reopened for discussion areas that for millennia were either ignored or treated as mere abstractions. This implies that the full ethical responsibility of Jews cannot be carried out solely within the realm of individual relationships but must include involvement in the life of a fully articulated community. 
</p>


-<p>
This double involvement is most vividly apparent in the biblical period, when both were equally present as divine command and demand. In the rabbinic period, because of the new political context, the communal aspect receded, so that discussion was mainly oriented toward relationships between members of the Jewish community or between individuals as such and away from political responsibilities. Nonetheless, the virtues that were understood to govern these relationships were, in their biblical setting, communal as well. Righteousness and compassion had been obligations of the state, governing the relationship between political units, as the first two chapters of Amos make evident. At the same time, as Micah 6:8 shows, doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God were obligations of the individual as well. Given the situation of the Jewish Diaspora following the revolts against Rome in the 1st and 2nd centuries 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, the individual pattern became the primary object of concern. Theoretical ethical systems were not developed until the Middle Ages, but even in the early period it was understood that the dynamic of ethical theory stood behind the practical system of Halakha, the enumeration of legal precepts. This meant that the law assumed an ethical core that existed prior to revelation and that the laws were just and merciful because God was just and merciful. Thus an attempt was made to reduce the hundreds of precepts to a small number expressing the ethical essence of Torah. 
</p>

-<h4 tocid="35254">

<headtitle>The key moral virtues</headtitle>


-<p>
In keeping with the rabbinic understanding of Torah, study also was viewed as an ethical virtue. Passages from the Mishna, which are repeated in the traditional prayer book, enumerate a series of virtuous acts—honouring parents, deeds of steadfast love, attendance twice daily at worship, hospitality to wayfarers, visiting the sick, dowering brides, accompanying the dead to the grave, devotion in prayer, peacemaking in the community and in family life—and conclude by declaring that the study of Torah is the premier virtue. The extracts enumerated in the Mishna and the prayer book exhibit the complex variety of ethical behaviour called for within the Jewish tradition. To parental respect and family tranquillity are added the responsibility of parents for children, the duties of husband and wife in the establishment and maintenance of a family, and ethical obligations that extend from the conjugal rights of each to the protection of the wife if the marriage is dissolved. The biblical description of God as upholding the cause of the fatherless and the widow and befriending strangers, providing them with food and clothing (Deuteronomy 10:18), remained a factor in the structure of the community. Ethical requirements in economic life are expressed concretely in passages such as Leviticus 19:35–36: “You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measures of length or weight or quantity. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just 
<e>ephah</e>
, and a just 
<e>hin</e>
” (
<e>ephah</e>
and 
<e>hin</e>
are units of measure); another example is 
<xref topicid="21365" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Amos</xref>
’s bitter condemnation of those who “sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes” (Amos 2:6). Such injunctions, together with many other specific precepts and moral requirements, established the basis for a wide-ranging program that sought to govern, both in detail and in general, the economic life of the individual and the community. 
</p>


-<p>
Relations within the human sphere are not the only object of ethical concern; nature also is so regarded. The 
<xref topicid="25501" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">animal</xref>
world, in the biblical view, requires merciful consideration, so that on the Sabbath not only humans but also their domestic animals are required to rest (Exodus 20:10; 23:12). Mistreatment of beasts of burden is prohibited (Deuteronomy 22:4), and wanton destruction of animal life falls under the ban (Deuteronomy 6–7). In the rabbinic attitude toward creation, all of nature is the object of human solicitude. Thus, the food-yielding trees of a city under siege may not be destroyed, according to Deuteronomic legislation (Deuteronomy 20:14–20). The enlargement of this and other biblical precepts resulted in the generalized rabbinic prohibition, “You shall not destroy,” which governs human use of the environment.

<headtitle>The relation to non-Jewish communities and cultures</headtitle>

<p>Although the end of the Jewish state reduced the scope of ethical judgments in the political sphere, relations between the Jewish community and other polities—particularly the Roman and Christian empires and the Islamic states—provided opportunities for the exploration of the ethical implications of such encounters. Because most of these situations were characterized by gross disparities of power, with the Jews the weaker party, prudential considerations were dominant. Despite this, Jewish authorities sought to bring to bear upon these external arrangements the ethical standards that governed the internal structures.</p>


-<p>
The problem of the relationship between the Jewish community, in whatever form it has existed, and other social units has been vastly complicated. The relation is ideally that of witness to the divine intent in the world. Practically, it has swung between the extremes of isolation and 
<xref topicid="39328" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">assimilation</xref>
, in which the ideal has, on occasion, been lost sight of. Culturally, from its earliest beginnings, the people of Israel have met and engaged the ideas, forms, behaviours, and attitudes of their neighbours constructively. Israel reformulated what it received in terms of its own commitments and affirmations. On more than a few occasions, as in the period of settlement in Canaan, it rejected the religious and cultural ideas and forms of the indigenous population. On other occasions—as in Islamic Spain from the 8th to the 15th century—it actively sought out the ideas and cultural patterns of its neighbours, viewing them from its own perspective and embracing them when they were found to be of value. Indeed, the whole history of Israel’s relationship with the world may be comprehended in the metaphor, used previously, of the heartbeat with its systole and diastole. No period of its existence discloses either total rejection of or abject surrender to other cultural and political structures but rather a tension, with the focal point always in motion at varying rates. Judaism’s adjustment to and relation with other social and political units has involved larger aspects of communal and individual life. Whether or not under such circumstances it is helpful to describe Judaism as a civilization, it is important to recognize that, viewed functionally, much more must be included than is usually subsumed under the term 
<e>religion</e>
in modern Western societies.

<headtitle>The formulation of Jewish ethical doctrines</headtitle>


-<p>
The ethical concerns of Judaism have frequently been expressed in literary works. Not only were rabbinic writings constantly directed toward the establishment of legal patterns that embody such concerns, but in the medieval period the issues were dealt with in treatises on morals; in ethical wills, in which a father instructed his children about their obligations and behaviour; in sermons; and in other forms. In the 19th century the traditionalist Musar (“Moral Instructor”) movement in eastern Europe and the philosophical discussions of the nascent Reform movement in the West focused upon ethics. Indeed, since the political and social emancipation of the Jews, ethical and social rather than theological questions have been given priority. Often the positions espoused have turned out to be “Judaized” versions of ethical theories or political programs. In some instances, as in the case of the distinguished German Jewish philosopher 
<xref topicid="124534" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1637241">Hermann Cohen</xref>
(1842–1918), the result has been a compelling restatement of a secular philosophical ethics in Jewish form. In others it has resulted in no more than a pastiche. More crucial, however, is the question of the uniqueness and authority of Jewish ethics. The reestablishment of the Jewish state renewed the possibility that the full range of ethical decisions, communal and individual, may be confronted. In such a situation the ethical task of the people moves out of the realm of speculation to become actual again.

, as the debate over the correct understanding of Genesis 1:1 discloses. (Was there or was there not a preexisting matter, void, or chaos?) The interest of the author, however, was not in the mode of creation—a later concern perhaps reflected in the various translations of the verse, “In the beginning God created,” which could signify what medieval philosophers designated 
<e>creatio ex nihilo</e>
(“creation out of nothing”). He was concerned rather to affirm that the totality of existence—inanimate (Genesis 1:3–19), living (20–25), and human (26–31)—derived immediately from the same divine source. As divine creation, the universe is transparent to the presence of God, so that the Psalmist said, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims [that it is] the work of his hands” (19:1). Indeed, the repeated phrase, “And God saw how good it was” (Genesis 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 25, 31), may be understood as the foundation of this affirmation, for the workmanship discloses the workman. The observed order of the universe is further understood by the biblical author as the direct result of a covenantal relationship between the world and God: “So long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22). This doctrine of the providential ordering of the universe, reaffirmed in Rabbinic Judaism, is not without its difficulties, as in the liturgical change made in Isaiah 45:7 to avoid ascribing 
<xref topicid="197324" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">evil</xref>
to God. Despite the problem of theodicy, Judaism has not acquiesced to the mood reported in the Palestinian 
<xref topicid="583515" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Targum</xref>
to Genesis 4:8: “He did not create the world in mercy nor does he rule in mercy.” Rather, Judaism has affirmed a benevolent and compassionate God. 
</p>


-<p>
God’s creation, the physical world, provides the stage for history, which is the place of the human encounter with the divine. An early Midrash, responding to the question of why Scripture begins with the story of creation, asserts that it was necessary to establish the identity of the Creator with the giver of Torah, an argument basic to the liturgical structure of the 
<xref topicid="539803" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shema</xref>
. This relationship is further emphasized in the 
<xref topicid="317334" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620020">Kiddush</xref>
, the prayer of sanctification recited at the beginning of the Sabbath. That day is designated “a remembrance of creation” and “a recollection of the going-forth from Egypt.” Thus, creation (nature) and history are understood to be inextricably bound, for both derive from the same divine source. This being so, redemption—the reconciliation of God and man through and in history—does not ignore or exclude the natural world. Using the imagery of an extravagantly fecund world of nature, rabbinic thought expressed its view of the all-inclusive effects of the restored relationship. 
</p>

-<h4 tocid="35259">

<headtitle>Humanity’s place in the universe</headtitle>

<p>The human creature is, of course, subject to the natural order. Humans carry on their relationship with God in the world and through the world. The commandments of Torah are obeyed not solely as observances between humans and God but as actions between humans themselves and between humans and the world. The creation story describes the human as ruler over the earth and its inhabitants (Genesis 1:26–28; Psalms 8:5–9); nonetheless, far from being an arbitrary master, human dominion is limited by Torah. The regulations in the Torah are concerned not only with transactions between humans but also with human responsibilities to cultivated land, to the produce of the soil, and to domesticated animals. Bound in the network of existence, humans as moral creatures are responsible for creation in all its parts.</p>


-<p>
Even the destruction of the Jewish commonwealth in the 1st and 2nd centuries 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
did not alienate Jews from these responsibilities, as the elaborate system of 
<xref topicid="385262" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mishna</xref>
and Gemara reveals. The gradual but consistent exclusion of the Jews from immediate connection with large segments of the natural world, through legislation in Christendom and Islam, tended to dull their awareness of it. The recurring references to the natural world in the religious calendar, however, and the observation of harvest festivals even by city dwellers continued to remind the community of its ties. Thus, at the end of the 19th century, the nascent Zionist movement recognized that the regeneration of the Jewish people involved, among other requirements, a responsible relation to the natural order expressed in its attitude toward and treatment of the land. 
</p>

<p>If nature as the place of divine disclosure has, during long periods of Jewish existence, assumed a somewhat subordinate role, it has never been rejected or been seen to be irrelevant to the divine purpose. Indeed, in Jewish eschatology, its restoration is part of the goal of history.</p>

The exact nature of nonhuman beings mentioned in Scripture—angels, or messengers (
<e>angel</e>
is derived from the Greek word 
<e>angelos</e>
, which is the equivalent of the Hebrew word 
<e>mal’akh</e>
, “messenger”)—is not altogether clear, and their roles seem ephemeral (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="24463" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645922">angel and demon</xref>
). In the postexilic period, perhaps under Iranian influence, and in the late biblical and postbiblical literature, these beings emerge as more complete and often as clearly identifiable individuals with their own personal names. The unfocused biblical view gave way to an elaborate hierarchy of functionaries who acted, in some apocalyptic visions, as a veritable heavenly bureaucracy. Despite a consensus concerning their existence, there was little agreement about their role or importance. In some Midrashim, God takes counsel with them; in other sources, the rabbis urge Jews not to involve them but to approach God directly. 
</p>

<p>Like their counter-figures the demons, angels have a residual existence rooted in various layers of the Jewish experience and interpretation of the universe. At some times they are highly individualized and sharply realized; at others they are much more imaginary. The medieval philosophers and the early mystics saw them through Aristotelian or Neoplatonic categories. The Kabbalists continually invented new angels and fitted them into their complicated network of cosmic existence. Their role, however, even in periods of considerable emphasis, was peripheral, and they were outside the great movements and meanings of Jewish thought.</p>


-<p>
Contemporary philosophical speculation about the nature of the universe has, of course, required a response from Jewish thinkers. But, given the particular temper of a period in which metaphysics has not been central to much of theological discussion, no major statement has developed that has taken hold of the dominant positions and attempted to view them from the Jewish creationist perspective. The attempt within 
<xref topicid="493759" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Reconstructionism</xref>

The choice of Israel, according to the Bible, occurred because of humankind’s continual failure, by rebellion against its creator, to fulfill its divine potential. The subsequent inability of Israel to become the holy community and thereby a witness to the nations gave rise to the prophetic movement that summoned the people to obedience. An integral part of prophetic summoning, side by side with threats of punishment and warnings of disaster, was the vision of a truly holy community, a society fully responding to the divine imperative. This 
<xref topicid="318226" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">kingdom</xref>
of the future was conceived of as entirely natural, functioning as any normal social and political unit. The future kingdom would be governed by a human ruler, who would carry out his tasks within the sphere of divine sovereignty, serving primarily to exhibit his own obedience and thus to stimulate the obedience of the entire people. This future monarch was often, though not always, portrayed in terms of an idealized 
<xref topicid="152497" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">David</xref>
, using features of his life and reign that would emphasize submission to God, social stability, economic satisfaction, and peace.

<xref topicid="199492" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Ezekiel</xref>
provide the constitution for the new commonwealth but do not describe the peculiar characteristics of the ruler, while the later chapters of the 
<xref topicid="295147" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Isaiah</xref>
focus on several figures—including 
<xref topicid="148758" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659205">Cyrus II</xref>
the Mede, who conquered the Babylonian Empire and freed the Jews from Babylonian captivity—who are seen as the divine instruments ushering in a new era. Although the virtues ascribed to these figures are extraordinary, they are neither superhuman nor suprahuman; indeed, they are required of all Israel and of all humanity. The frustrations of the postexilic period, when several attempts to bring the holy community into being were largely thwarted by the imperial designs of the great powers—as they had been in the preexilic period—led to an emphasis on the futuristic quality of messianic hope. This was abetted undoubtedly by external influences, such as 
<xref topicid="293595" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Iranian thought</xref>
, in which the cosmic rather than the historic aspect of a future era dominated. Because ancient cosmic myths had been part of the Israelite intellectual inheritance, as seen in literary usages throughout Scriptures, the impact of such ideas was to reinvigorate the mythic elements in Judaism. Thus, hopes for the future at the end of the Persian period and through the Hellenistic period comprised both historical expectations focused upon an earthly community and cosmic-mythic visions that moved on a broader stage. The latter were, of course, never entirely absent from historical expectations, for a renewal of nature was viewed as integral to the functioning of true society. The obedient community required, and was to be granted, a natural world in which true human relations could exist. In its most vivid form, the apocalypse (i.e., a visionary disclosure of the future), the literature of the period affords a remarkable insight into the agonies and urgencies of the people (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="29733" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1645935">apocalyptic literature</xref>
). After the disappointments of the past are recounted, the present, in transparent disguise, is portrayed, and the imminent and desired intervention of God is described in awesome detail as a means of affirming and confirming the faith of those who saw themselves as the remnant, or perhaps the promise, of the holy community.

The king-
<xref topicid="377146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">messiah</xref>
and his reign 
</headtitle>


-<p>
Israel’s hope was for the restoration of divine sovereignty over all of creation. Among the variety of expressions of such hope, that which centred around the idealized king assumed an ever more important (but never exclusive) role. Many of the writings that report the ideas and attitudes of the Jewish community in the period immediately preceding and following the rise of Christianity are either ignorant of or more probably indifferent to the personal element. God is envisioned as the protagonist of the end, actively intervening or sending his messengers (i.e., angels) to perform specific acts in ending the old era and inaugurating the new one. On the other hand, in some writings of the period the anointed king-messiah (Hebrew: 
<e>mashiaḥ</e>
, “anointed”)—the title reflects the episode in 1 Samuel 16 in which David is thus singled out as the divinely chosen ruler—becomes more sharply defined as the central figure in the culminating events and, given the cosmic-mythic components, assumes suprahuman and, in some instances, even quasi-divine aspects. Although the doctrine of last things in Judaism is not necessarily messianic, if that term is properly limited to an inauguration of a future era through the action of a human, suprahuman, or quasi-divine person, the messianic version of eschatology played a more compelling role in Rabbinic Judaism than other modes. The same is true with regard to the locus of the “world (or age) to come.” Given the ingredients noted above, it was possible to construct various eschatological landscapes, ranging from the mundane to the celestial, from Jerusalem in the hills of Judah to a heavenly city. Indeed, medieval theologians, confronted with an embarrassment of riches, sought to combine them into an inclusive system that involved as many of the possibilities as could be brought together. In such patterns the messianic this-worldly emphasis was understood as a preliminary movement toward an ultimate resolution. The ideal ruler, the new David, would reestablish the kingdom in its own land (in Zion, or Palestine) and would reign in righteousness, equity, justice, and truth, thus bringing into being the holy nation and summoning all humankind to dwell under divine sovereignty. As a component of this reestablished kingdom, the righteous dead of Israel would be 
<xref topicid="499816" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">resurrected</xref>
to enjoy a life in the true community that did not exist in their days. This kingdom, however long it was destined to endure, was not permanent. It would come to an end either at a predetermined time or as a victim of unrepentant nations and cosmic foes, at which point the ultimate intervention by God would take place. All the wicked throughout history would be recalled to life, judged, and doomed, and all the righteous would be transformed and transported into a new world; i.e., creation would be totally restored. 
</p>


-<p>
The particular emphases that one or the other of these ideas received and the ways in which they were interpreted—philosophically, mystically, and ethically—were determined most frequently by the situations and conditions in which the Jewish community found itself. With a considerable body of ideas at its disposal and with the details of none of them ever receiving the kind of affirmation given to statements about God, Torah, and Israel, freedom of speculation in the realm of eschatology was little restricted. Thus, 
<xref topicid="13063" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Joseph Albo</xref>
, in his work on Jewish “dogmas”—the 
<e>Sefer ha-ʿiqqarim</e>
(1485; “Book of Principles”)—was not inhibited from denying that belief in the messiah was fundamental. The mystical movements of the Middle Ages found in eschatological hopes a crucial centre. The early 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kabbala</xref>
was little interested in messianism, for it reoriented such expectations in the direction of personal redemption. However, following the disasters of the late 15th–17th centuries (e.g., the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and the Cossack massacre of the Jews in Poland), messianic speculation in all its varieties underwent a luxuriant growth, finally running wild in the movements surrounding 
<xref topicid="537449" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shabbetai Tzevi</xref>
of Smyrna and later 
<xref topicid="217179" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jacob Frank</xref>
of Offenbach. These tragedies for the Jewish communities once again resulted in deferring eschatological hopes or at least limiting their application.

<headtitle>Secularization of messianism</headtitle>


-<p>
In the 19th century, with the political emancipation of the Jews in western Europe and the development of an optimistic evolutionism, messianism was transformed by many liberal thinkers into a version of the idea of progress, a goal that was often thought of as immediately attainable through enlightened social and political action. When disillusionment with emancipation set in, messianism was even more completely secularized by segments of the community who saw its meaning and fulfillment in some form of 
<xref topicid="551569" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">socialism</xref>
. In others it was absorbed into the emerging political nationalism—
<xref topicid="657475" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Zionism</xref>
. Similar developments took place in eastern Europe, with parallel transformations. In the 20th century, particularly after the events symbolized by

(a Nazi 
<xref topicid="198928" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">death camp</xref>
in Poland, where approximately one million Jews were killed), the earlier modern interpretations, particularly of messianism, but also of eschatology as a whole, were considered inadequate. Although no compelling statement was forthcoming, Jewish thinkers beginning in the second half of the 20th century attempted once again to come to grips with eschatological concepts in all their varieties and forms.

<headtitle>The hallowing of everyday existence</headtitle>

Systematic presentations of the affirmations of the Jewish community were never the sole mode of expressing the beliefs of the people. Maintaining an equal importance with speculation—Haggadic, philosophic, mystical, or ethical—was 
<xref topicid="252201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620049">Halakhah</xref>
(Oral Law), the paradigmatic statement of the individual and communal behaviour that embodied the beliefs conceptualized in speculation. Life in the holy community was understood to embrace every level of human existence. The prophets vigorously resisted attempts to limit the sovereignty of the God of Israel to organized 
<xref topicid="649187" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">worship</xref>
and ritual. The Pharisees, even while the cult of the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jerusalem Temple</xref>
was still in existence, sought to reduce priestly exclusiveness by enlarging the scope of sacral rules to include, as far as possible, all the people. 
<xref topicid="487890" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rabbinic Judaism</xref>
, Pharisaism’s descendant, continued the process of democratization and sought to find in every occasion of life a means of affirming the presence of the divine. Some critics of Rabbinic Judaism, however, have seen the legal aspect of Jewish life as stifling. Although legalism is always a danger, spontaneity is not necessarily lacking in a world governed by 
<xref topicid="252201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Halakhah</xref>
. Moreover, the intention of the Halakhic attitude is to remind Jews that every occasion of life is a locus of divine disclosure. This is most clearly seen in the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="61446" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">berakhot</xref>
, 
</e>
the “blessings,” that are prescribed to accompany the performance of a broad spectrum of human actions, from the routines of daily life to the restricted gestures of the cultic-liturgical year. In these God is addressed directly in the second person singular, his sovereignty is affirmed, and his activity as creator, giver of Torah, or redeemer—expressed in a wide variety of eulogies—is proclaimed. There are no areas of 
<xref topicid="275332" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human behaviour</xref>
in which God cannot be met, and the Halakhic pattern is intended to make such possibilities realities. The situation of the Jewish community, however, determines how this intention is realized. On more than one occasion, the Halakhic pattern has served as a defense against a hostile environment, thus becoming a kind of scrupulousness (an obsessive concern with minute details), but, just as often, the dynamic of the intention has broken through to reestablish its integrity and to hallow life in its wholeness.

<headtitle>The traditional pattern of individual and familial practices</headtitle>


-<p>
The traditional pattern of an individual’s life can be discerned by examining a passage from the Babylonian 
<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Talmud</xref>
(tractate 
<e>Berakhot</e>
60b) that was reworked into a liturgical structure but which in its original form exhibits the intention discussed above. In this passage, the blessings accompanying one’s waking and returning to the routines of life are prescribed. There is a brief thanksgiving on awakening for being restored to conscious life; then a benediction is offered over the cock’s crowing; following this, each ordinary act—opening one’s eyes, stretching and sitting up, dressing, standing up, walking, tying one’s shoes, fastening one’s belt, covering one’s head, washing one’s hands and face—has its accompanying blessing, reminding one that the world and the life to which he has returned exist in the presence of God. These are followed by a supplication in which the petitioner asks that his life during the day may be worthy in all of its relationships. Then, as the first order of daily business, Torah, both written (Bible) and oral (Mishna), is briefly studied, introduced by doxologies to God as Giver of Torah. Finally, there is a prayer for the establishment of the kingdom of God, for each day contains within itself the possibility of ultimate fulfillment. As indicated, this was originally not a part of public worship but rather was personal preparation for a life to be lived in the presence of God (even today it is not, strictly speaking, part of the synagogue service, though it is frequently recited there). 
</p>


-<p>
Such individual responsibility marks much of Jewish observance, so that the synagogue—far from being the focus of observance—shares with the home and the workaday world the opportunities for divine-human encounter. The table blessings, 
<xref topicid="317334" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kiddush</xref>
(the “sanctification” of the Sabbath and festivals), the erection of the booth (
<e>sukka</e>
) for 
<xref topicid="572270" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620050">Sukkoth </xref>
(the 
<xref topicid="572270" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Feast of Tabernacles</xref>
), the 
<xref topicid="532142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">seder</xref>
(the festive Passover meal) with its symbols and narration of the Exodus, and the lighting of the lamps during the eight days of 
<xref topicid="254643" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620051">Hanukkah</xref>
(the 
<xref topicid="254643" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Feast of Dedication</xref>
) are all the obligation of the individual and the family and have their place in the home. It is here too where the woman’s role is defined and where, as contrasted with the synagogue, she functions centrally. Given the traditional dietary regimen of the Jewish community—the exclusion of swine, carrion eaters, 
<xref topicid="539776" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">shellfish</xref>
, and certain other creatures, the separation of meat and 
<xref topicid="149947" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">dairy products</xref>
, the ritual slaughtering of animals, the required separation and burning of a small portion of dough (
<e>ḥalla</e>
) when baking, the supervision of the Passover food requirements, and many other stipulations—there exists a large and meticulously governed area in the home that is the sphere of woman’s religion. There seems not to have been a hierarchy of values in which the home-centred—as contrasted with the synagogue-oriented—practices were given an inferior status. In modern times, however—particularly in Western societies, where the pervasiveness of religious obligation has been replaced by ecclesiastical institutionalism on the prevailing Christian model—this whole crucial area has lost much of its meaning as a place of divine-human meeting. Thus, for many it is only the synagogue that provides such an opportunity, and the individual act has been reduced on the scale of values. With this downgrading, woman’s religion has lost its significance, so that her status—when parallels are drawn to her role in the larger society—has become inferior to that of men. However attenuated personal religious responsibility may have become, the intention of the Halakhic structure, the hallowing of the individual’s total existence, remains a potent force within the Jewish community.

The other focus of observance is the 
<xref topicid="578206" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620052">synagogue</xref>
. The origins of this institution are obscure, and a number of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the appearance of this lay-oriented form of worship. According to various ancient sources, during the period of the Second Temple—following the return from Babylon and continuing until the Temple’s destruction in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
—various non-sacrificial modes of worship emerged that were independent of the priesthood and the official cult. The reports by the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus in the 1st century, buttressed by the 
<xref topicid="154274" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Dead Sea Scrolls</xref>
, provide some knowledge of the practices of the contemporary Essenes. Rabbinic sources, including the earliest layers of the traditional order of worship, provide insights into an apparently Pharisaic mode, and passages from the Acts of the Apostles concerning James and other Jewish Christians suggest still other varieties. In any case, the practitioners of what eventually became Rabbinic Judaism observed a form of worship that, with the destruction of the Temple cult, provided a new centre and even absorbed enough from the defunct priestly institution to suggest continuity and legitimacy with the Judaic past. This was probably the basic pattern for synagogal liturgy in the millennia that followed. 
</p>


-<p>
At the heart of synagogal 
<xref topicid="474128" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">worship</xref>
is the public reading of Scriptures. This takes place at the morning service on Sabbaths, holy days, and festivals, on Monday and Thursday mornings, and on Sabbath afternoons. The readings from the Pentateuch are currently arranged in an annual cycle so that, beginning with Genesis 1:1 on the Sabbath following the autumnal festivals, the entire five books are read through the rest of the year. The texts for festivals, holy days, and fasts reflect the particular significance of those occasions. In addition, a second portion from the prophetic writings (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, as well as the three major and 12 minor Prophets, but not Daniel) is read on many of these occasions. The readings take place within the structure of public worship and are incorporated into ceremonies in which the 
<xref topicid="532601" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sefer Torah</xref>
(“Book of the Torah”), the pentateuchal scroll, is removed from the ark (cabinet) at the front of the synagogue and carried in procession to the reading desk; from it, the pertinent text is chanted by the reader. The text for the service is divided into subsections varying from seven on the Sabbath to three at the weekday morning service, and individuals are called forward to recite the blessings eulogizing God as Giver of Torah before and after each of these. The order of worship is composed of the preparatory blessings and prayers, to which are added passages recalling the Temple sacrificial cult (thus relating the present form of worship to the past); the recitation of a number of Psalms and biblical prayers; the Shema and its accompanying benedictions, introduced by a call to worship that marks the beginning of formal public worship; the prayer (
<e>tefilla</e>
) in the strict sense of petition; confession and supplication (
<e>taḥanun</e>
) on weekdays; the reading of Scripture; and concluding acts of worship. This general structure of the morning service varies somewhat, with additions and subtractions for the afternoon and evening services and for Sabbath, holy days, and festivals. 
</p>


-<p>
The prayer (
<e>tefilla</e>
) is often called the 
<e>shemone ʿesre</e>
, the “Eighteen Benedictions”—though it actually has 19—or the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="20563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ʿamida</xref>

</e>
, “standing,” because it is recited in that position. It is made up of three introductory benedictions (praise of the God of the Fathers, of God the Redeemer who resurrects the dead, and of God the Holy One who fills the earth with his glory) and three concluding acts (a prayer for the acceptance of the service, a thanksgiving, and a prayer for peace). Between the introductory and concluding sections there is a series of intermediate petitions for knowledge, well-being, acceptance of repentance, forgiveness of sin, and others. On the Sabbath and on festivals the petitions are replaced by benedictions that mention the specific occasion but are not petitionary; it is considered inappropriate to attend to workaday concerns at these times. 
</p>


-<p>
The general outline of this order of service is found throughout the entire Jewish world, but the details have varied in different periods and geographic and 
<xref topicid="146313" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">cultural areas</xref>
. The 
<xref topicid="119404" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">public service</xref>
, requiring the presence of at least 10 males, the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="384689" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">minyan</xref>

<e>ḥazzan</e>
, or 
<xref topicid="93248" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638776">cantor</xref>
, but any Jewish male with the requisite knowledge may act in this capacity, since there is no clerical class in the community to whom such leadership is limited. 
</p>


-<p>
The synagogue room itself has a very simple basic form, though it may be embellished considerably. The only requirements are a container for the Torah scroll(s), called the 
<e>aron ha-qodesh</e>
(“the holy 
<xref topicid="34867" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ark</xref>
”), a chest against the east wall or a recessed closet with doors and a curtain; a prayer desk (
<e>ʿamud</e>
) facing the ark, at which the reader stands when reciting the service; and the pulpit (bima)—in or close to the centre of the room, according to some requirements—from which the Torah is read. In the Spanish-Portuguese tradition, only one desk (called 
<e>teva</e>
) is used. The ark contains one or more scrolls, on which are written the 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Five Books of Moses</xref>
. These are variously ornamented, depending upon the cultural region: European communities deck them in coverings of cloth; Oriental communities (North African and Near Eastern) place them in wooden or metal containers. In addition, silver ornaments (
<e>rimonim</e>
) in the form of towers or crowns are often set on the tops of two rods on which the scroll is wound, and a breastplate (
<e>hoshen</e>
) and a pointer (

-<e>

<xref topicid="651125" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">yad</xref>

) are suspended from them.

<p>Accommodations for the worshippers vary according to the cultural milieu, from rugs and cushions in Oriental synagogues to pews and standing desks in European ones.

<headtitle>Holy places: the land of Israel and Jerusalem</headtitle>

<p>The land of Israel, as is evident from the biblical narratives, played a significant role in the life and thought of the Israelites. It was the promised home, for the sake of which Abraham left his birthplace; the haven toward which those escaping from Egyptian servitude moved; and the hope of the exiles in Babylon. In the long centuries following the destruction of the Judean state by the Romans, it was a central part of messianic and eschatological expectations.</p>


-<p>
During the early period of settlement, there apparently were many sacred localities, with one or another functioning for a time as a central shrine for all the tribes. Even the establishment of 
<xref topicid="302812" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jerusalem</xref>
as the political capital by David and the building of a royal chapel there by Solomon did not bring an end to local cult centres. It was not until the reign of

complained bitterly about its arrogance and exactions, attempting, when feasible, to impose and enforce Pharisaic regulations upon it—reverence for the Temple seems to have remained a widespread sentiment. With the destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, such reverence was transformed both by messianic expectations and by eschatological hopes into fervent devotion, which, over the following centuries, became idealized and even supernaturalized. The most ardently articulated statement of the crucial role of the land of Israel and the Jerusalem Temple is found in the 
<e>Sefer ha-Kuzari</e>
of Judah ha-Levi, in which the two are seen as absolutely indispensable for the proper relationship between God and his people. 
</p>

<p>Symbolizing the significance of the land and of the city is the practice of facing in their direction during worship. The earliest architectural evidence derived from synagogue remains in Galilee indicates that the attempt was made to arrange the building in such a way that the worshippers faced directly toward Jerusalem. This practice may have continued even in the Diaspora, but at a later date the present practice of setting the holy ark in or before the east wall was established, so that “facing Jerusalem” is now more symbolic than actual.</p>

-<p>
The transformation of Hebrew into a sacred language is closely tied to the political fate of the people. In the period following the return from the Babylonian Exile, 
<xref topicid="32043" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Aramaic</xref>
, a cognate of Hebrew, functioned as the international or imperial language in official life and gained a foothold as a vernacular. It did not, despite claims made by some scholars, displace the everyday Hebrew of the people. The language of the Mishna, far from being a scholar’s dialect, seems to reflect popular speech, as did the Koine (common) Greek of the New Testament. Displacement of Hebrew—both in its literary form in Scriptures and in its popular usage—occurred in the 
<xref topicid="161756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Diaspora</xref>
, however, as illustrated by the translation of Scriptures into Greek in some communities and into Aramaic in others. There seems also to have been an inclination on the part of some authorities to permit even the recitation of the 
<xref topicid="539803" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shema</xref>
complex in the vernacular during the worship service. Struggles over these issues continued for a number of centuries in various places, but the development of formal literary Hebrew—a sacred tongue, to be used side by side with the Hebrew Scriptures in worship—brought them to an end. Although the communities of the Diaspora used the vernaculars of their environment in day-to-day living and even—as in the case of the communities of the 
<xref topicid="295765" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islamic world</xref>
—for philosophical, theological, and other scholarly writings, Hebrew remained the standard in worship until modern times, when some western European reform movements sought partially—and a very small fraction even totally—to displace it.

<headtitle>The rabbinate</headtitle>


-<h4 tocid="35273">

<headtitle>Legal, judicial, and congregational roles</headtitle>


-<p>
The rabbinate, with its peculiar nature and functions, is the result of a series of developments that began after the disastrous second revolt against Rome (132–135 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
). The term 
<e>rabbi</e>
(“my teacher”) was originally an honorific title for the graduates of the academy directed by the 
<e>nasi</e>
, or patriarch, who was the head of the Jewish community in Palestine as well as a Roman imperial official. The curriculum of the school was Torah, written and oral, according to the Pharisaic tradition and formulation. The 
<e>nasi</e>
appointed rabbis to the 
<xref topicid="140637" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">law court</xref>
(the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="63134" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">bet din</xref>

</e>
) and as legal officers of local communities; acting with the local elders, they supervised and controlled the life of the community and its members in all aspects. A similar situation obtained in 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylon</xref>
under the Parthian and Sāsānian empires, where the 
<e>resh galuta</e>
, or exilarch (“head of the exile”), appointed rabbinical officials to legal and administrative posts. In time the patriarchate and exilarchate disappeared, but the rabbinate, nourished by independent rabbinical academies, survived. An authorized scholar, when called to become the judicial officer of a community, would at the same time become the head of the local academy and, after adequate preparation and examination, would grant authorization to his pupils, who were then eligible to be called to rabbinical posts. There was thus a diffusion of authority, the communities calling, rather than a superior official appointing, their rabbis. The rabbis were not ecclesiastical personages but communal officials, responsible for the governance of the entire range of life of what was understood to be the 
<e>qehilla qedosha</e>
, the “holy community.” 
</p>

<p>In modern times, particularly in the Western world, the change in Jewish communal existence required a transformation of this ancient structure. The rabbinate became, for the most part, an ecclesiastical rather than a communal agency, reflecting the requirements of civic life in modern nation states. The education of rabbis is now carried on in seminaries whose structure and curriculum have been influenced by European and American academic institutions. The majority of their graduates serve as congregational rabbis, in roles similar to those of ministers and priests in Christian denominations but with some other functions deriving from the particular situation and nature of the Jewish community.</p>


-<p>
In the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">State of Israel</xref>
certain larger areas, such as that of 
<xref topicid="201326" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">family law</xref>
, are still reserved for the rabbinate. Even here, however, the rabbinate functions more as a counterpart to other ecclesiastical organizations, such as Christian and Muslim, than as an overarching and all-inclusive communal agency.

-<p>
The existence of the offices of 
<xref topicid="110793" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chief rabbi</xref>
in the State of Israel derives from the situation in the 
<xref topicid="434996" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ottoman Empire</xref>
, where the various religious communities functioned as quasi-political entities in a multiethnic conglomerate. Israel has two chief rabbis, one for the Ashkenazic (European) and one for the Sephardic (Oriental) community; they no longer function as the heads of whole communities but only of ecclesiastical organizations. The same is true in countries outside Israel that have the office of chief rabbi (e.g., 
<xref topicid="243007" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Great Britain</xref>
and France); in these countries the chief rabbi’s relationship with the government is like that of his ecclesiastical counterparts in the Christian churches. While the chief rabbis have certain kinds of limited authority because of their official position, they have jurisdiction only over those members of the Jewish community who are ready to accept it; others form their own ecclesiastical units and act without reference to the 
<xref topicid="110793" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chief rabbinate</xref>

<headtitle>General councils or conferences</headtitle>


-<p>
The nature of the 
<xref topicid="522434" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sanhedrin</xref>
in the last years of the Jewish commonwealth is a much disputed matter. The several councils mentioned in Talmudic literature are equally difficult to define with any precision. References scattered throughout medieval literature suggest the existence of councils and synods, but their composition and authority are uncertain. About the year 1000 a synod was held in the Rhineland in which French and German communities participated under the guidance of Rabbenu Gershom, the leading rabbinic authority of the region. In the late Middle Ages, representatives from the communities of Great Poland, Little Poland, Russian Poland (Volhynia), and Lithuania came together to form the Waʿad Arbaʿ Aratzot (Council of the Four Lands). At the beginning of the modern era, Napoleon in 1806 summoned the Assembly of Notables—representatives of communities under French dominion—to deal with questions arising from the dissolution of the older status of the Jews and their naturalization as individuals into the new nation-states. Decisions of the assembly that involved questions of Jewish law were subsequently submitted to a Grand Sanhedrin called by Napoleon to provide Halakhic justification for acts that the French imperial government had required of the Jewish communities. 
</p>


-<p>
During the 19th century the demand for the reform of Jewish life—principally the liturgy of the synagogue but many other aspects as well—prompted a series of rabbinical conferences and synods. A similar course of events took place in the United States. In both instances, after an initial period in which radicals, moderates, and conservatives argued their respective cases in the same forum, polarization set in and intellectual differences were transformed into competing organizations. In the 1970s the several tendencies within the Jewish communities in 
<xref topicid="418612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North America</xref>
were institutionalized in 
<xref topicid="487879" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">rabbinical</xref>
conferences and congregational unions—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—whose influence was in large measure limited to their adherents. There is also a worldwide body of Reform or 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Liberal Judaism</xref>
—the World Union for Progressive Judaism. One result of these developments was the hardening of denominational differences, particularly in North America, especially between Orthodox and non-Orthodox (Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative) Judaisms.

<headtitle>Modern variations</headtitle>


-<p>
The preceding sketch of basic practices and institutions has attempted to describe the so-called traditional situation, though it has been indicated that even here there are variations—actually more than have been noted. Reference has also been made to changes that represent the abandonment of traditional practices on the basis of intellectual decisions about the nature of Judaism, its beliefs, practices, and institutions. Such changes are far too numerous to describe in detail, but it is important to indicate their motivation. The 
<xref topicid="252201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Halakhic</xref>
system, both as a whole and in all of its parts, is viewed not as divinely revealed but rather as a human process that seeks to expose in mutable forms the meaning of the divine-human encounter. The practices and institutions, therefore, are understood as historically determined, reflecting the multifaceted experience of the people of Israel as they have sought to live in the presence of God. Historical scholarship has disclosed the origins, rise, development, and decline of these structures in the past and thus suggests the propriety of changes in the present and future that appear to fulfill the needs of the community and its members. However, this kind of historicism (the explanation of values and forms in terms of their historical conditions) has been applied in widely different ways since it was first used in the 19th century. Some have seen it as justifying a disengagement from much if not all of the traditional pattern and a recognition that only the spiritual essence is of consequence for Judaism. Others have argued that the burden of proof is always upon those who would introduce changes. Since the end of 
<xref topicid="648813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">World War II</xref>
, the question has been whether a reconstituted Halakhic system might not be a requirement of the day.

The calendar of Judaism includes the cycle of Sabbaths and holidays that are commonly observed by the Jewish religious community—and officially in Israel by the Jewish secular community as well. The Sabbath and festivals are bound to the 
<xref topicid="303554" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jewish calendar</xref>

-<h3 tocid="260813">

<headtitle>The cycle of the religious year</headtitle>


-<p>
According to Jewish teaching, the Sabbath and festivals are, in the first instance, commemorative. The Sabbath, for example, commemorates the Creation, and Passover commemorates the Exodus from Egypt over 3,000 years ago. The past is not merely recalled; it is also relived through the Sabbath and festival observances. Creative physical activity ceases on the Sabbath—as it did, according to Genesis, when Creation was completed; Jews leave their homes and reside in booths during the 
<xref topicid="572270" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sukkoth</xref>
festival, as did their biblical ancestors. Moreover, Sabbath and festival themes are considered to be perpetually significant, recurring and renewed in every generation. Thus, the revelation of the Torah (the divine teaching, or law) at Sinai, commemorated on 
<xref topicid="539030" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shavuot</xref>
, is considered an ongoing process that recurs whenever a commitment is made to Torah study. 
</p>


-<p>
An important aspect of Sabbath and festival observance is sanctification. The Sabbath and festivals sanctified the Jews more than the Jews sanctified the Sabbath and festivals. Mundane meals became sacred meals; joy and relaxation became sacred obligations (
<e>mitzwot</e>
). No less significant is the contribution of the Sabbath and festivals to communal awareness. Thus, neither Sabbath nor festival can be properly observed in the synagogue, according to the ancient tradition, if fewer than 10 Jewish males are present. Again, a Jew prays on 
<xref topicid="510009" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rosh Hashana</xref>
and mourns on 
<xref topicid="596967" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Tisha be-Av</xref>
not only for his own fate but for the fate of all Jews. The sense of social cohesiveness fostered by the Sabbath and festival observances has stood the Jews well throughout their long, often tortuous history. 
</p>

<p>The seven-day week, the notion of a weekly day of rest, and many Christian and Islamic holiday observances owe their origins to the Jewish calendar, Sabbath, and festivals.</p>

<headtitle>Lunisolar structure</headtitle>


-<p>
The Jewish calendar is lunisolar—i.e., regulated by the positions of both the Moon and the Sun. It consists usually of 12 alternating lunar months of 29 and 30 days each (except for Ḥeshvan and Kislev, which sometimes have either 29 or 30 days) and totals 353, 354, or 355 days per year. The average lunar year (354 days) is adjusted to the solar year (365

<num>1</num>

<den>4</den>

</frac>
days) by the periodic introduction of 
<xref topicid="333933" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">leap years</xref>
in order to assure that the major festivals fall in their proper seasons. The 
<xref topicid="333933" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">leap year</xref>
consists of an additional 30-day month called First Adar, which always precedes the month of (Second) Adar. A leap year consists of either 383, 384, or 385 days and occurs seven times during every 19-year period (the 
<xref topicid="378722" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Metonic cycle</xref>
). Among the consequences of the lunisolar structure are these: the number of days in a year may vary considerably, from 353 to 385 days; and the first day of a month can fall on any day of the week, that day varying from year to year. Consequently, the days of the week upon which an annual Jewish festival falls vary from year to year despite the festival’s fixed position in the Jewish month.

<headtitle>Origin and development</headtitle>


-<p>
The origin of the Jewish calendar can no longer be accurately traced. Some scholars suggest that a solar year prevailed in ancient Israel, but no convincing proofs have been offered, and it is more likely that a lunisolar calendar similar to that of ancient Babylonia was used. In late 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Second Temple</xref>
times (i.e., 1st century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
to 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), calendrical matters were regulated by the Sanhedrin, or council of elders, at Jerusalem. The testimony of two witnesses who had observed the new moon was ordinarily required to proclaim a new month. Leap years were proclaimed by a council of three or more rabbis with the approval of the 
<e>nasi</e>
, or patriarch, of the Sanhedrin. With the decline of the Sanhedrin, calendrical matters were decided by the Palestinian patriarchate (the official heads of the Jewish community under Roman rule). Jewish persecution under the Roman emperor 
<xref topicid="134089" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623293">Constantius II </xref>
(reigned 337–361) and advances in astronomical science led to the gradual replacement of observation by calculation. According to 
<xref topicid="251696" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623294">Hai ben Sherira</xref>
(died 1038), the head of a leading Talmudic academy in Babylonia, the Palestinian patriarch Hillel II introduced a fixed and continuous calendar in 359 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. A summary of the regulations governing the present calendar is provided by Maimonides, the great medieval philosopher and legist, in his 

-<e>
Code: Sanctification of the 
<xref topicid="411855" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">New Moon</xref>

chapters 6–10.

<xref topicid="277" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0"> ben Meir</xref>

<xref topicid="373435" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0"/>
, a 10th-century Palestinian descendant of the patriarchal (Hillel) family, and the Babylonian Jewish authorities, including Saʿadia ben Joseph, an eminent 9th–10th-century philosopher and gaon (head of a Talmudic academy). Ben Meir’s calculations provided that Passover in 922 be celebrated two days earlier than the date fixed by the normative calendar. After a bitter exchange of letters, the controversy subsided in favour of the Babylonian authorities, whose hegemony in calendrical matters was never again challenged. 
</p>


-<p>
Calendars of various sectarian Jewish communities deviated considerably from the normative calendar described above. The 
<xref topicid="154254" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Dead Sea</xref>
, or Qumrān, community (made famous by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls) adopted the calendrical system of the noncanonical books of Jubilees and Enoch, which was essentially a 
<xref topicid="552874" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">solar calendar</xref>
. Elements of the same calendar reappear among the Mishawites, a sect founded in the 9th century. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<xref topicid="311998" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Karaites</xref>
, a sect founded in the 8th century, refused, with some exceptions, to recognize the normative fixed calendar and reintroduced observation of the new moon. Leap years were determined by observing the maturation of the barley crop in Palestine. Consequently, Karaites often celebrated the festivals on dates different from those fixed by the rabbis. Later, in medieval times, the Karaites adopted some of the normative calendrical practices while rejecting others.

</headtitle>


-<p>
The Jewish Sabbath (from Hebrew 
<e>shavat</e>
, “to rest”) is observed throughout the year on the seventh day of the week—Saturday. According to biblical tradition, it commemorates the original seventh day on which God rested after completing the creation. 
</p>


-<p>
Scholars have not succeeded in tracing the origin of the seven-day 
<xref topicid="638786" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">week</xref>
, nor can they account for the origin of the Sabbath. A seven-day week does not accord well with either a solar or a 
<xref topicid="351352" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">lunar calendar</xref>
. Some scholars, pointing to the Akkadian term 
<e>shapattu</e>
, suggest a Babylonian origin for the seven-day week and the Sabbath. But 
<e>shapattu</e>
, which refers to the day of the full moon and is nowhere described as a day of rest, has little in common with the Jewish Sabbath. It appears that the notion of the Sabbath as a holy day of rest, linking God to his people and recurring every seventh day, was unique to ancient Israel. 
</p>


-<h4 tocid="260819">

<headtitle>Importance</headtitle>


-<p>
The central significance of the Sabbath for Judaism is reflected in the traditional commentative and interpretative literature called 
<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Talmud and Midrash</xref>
(e.g., “if you wish to destroy the Jewish people, abolish their Sabbath first”) and in numerous legends and adages from more-recent literature (e.g., “more than Israel kept the Sabbath, the Sabbath kept Israel”). Some of the basic teachings of Judaism affirmed by the Sabbath are God’s acts of creation, God’s role in history, and God’s covenant with Israel. Moreover, the Sabbath is the only Jewish holiday the observance of which is enjoined by the 
<xref topicid="587032" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ten Commandments</xref>
. Jews are obligated to sanctify the Sabbath at home and in the synagogue by observing the Sabbath laws and engaging in worship and study. The leisure hours afforded by the ban against work on the Sabbath were put to good use by the rabbis, who used them to promote intellectual activity and spiritual regeneration among Jews. Other days of rest, such as the Christian Sunday and the Islamic Friday, owe their origins to the Jewish Sabbath. 
</p>

</h4>


-<h4 tocid="260820">

<headtitle>Observances</headtitle>

<p>The biblical ban against work on the Sabbath, while never clearly defined, includes activities such as baking and cooking, travelling, kindling fire, gathering wood, buying and selling, and bearing burdens from one domain into another. The Talmudic rabbis listed 39 major categories of prohibited work, including agricultural activity (e.g., plowing and reaping), work entailed in the manufacture of cloth (e.g., spinning and weaving), work entailed in preparing documents (e.g., writing), and other forms of constructive work.</p>


-<p>
At home the Sabbath begins Friday evening some 20 minutes before sunset, with the lighting of the Sabbath candles by the wife or, in her absence, by the husband. In the synagogue the Sabbath is ushered in at sunset with the recital of selected psalms and the 
<e>Lekha Dodi</e>
, a 16th-century Kabbalistic (mystical) poem. The refrain of the latter is “Come, my beloved, to meet the bride,” the “bride” being the Sabbath. After the evening service, each Jewish household begins the first of three festive Sabbath meals by reciting the Kiddush (“sanctification” of the Sabbath) over a cup of wine. This is followed by a ritual washing of the hands and the breaking of bread, two loaves of bread (commemorating the double portions of manna described in Exodus) being placed before the breaker of bread at each Sabbath meal. After the festive meal the remainder of the evening is devoted to study or relaxation. The distinctive features of the Sabbath morning synagogue service include the public reading of the Torah, or Five Books of Moses (the portion read varies from week to week), and, generally, the sermon, both of which serve to educate the listeners. Following the service, the second Sabbath meal begins, again preceded by Kiddush (of lesser significance), conforming for the most part to the first Sabbath meal. The afternoon synagogue service is followed by the third festive meal (without Kiddush). After the evening service the Sabbath comes to a close with the 
<e>havdala</e>
(“distinction”) ceremony, which consists of a benediction noting the distinction between Sabbath and weekday, usually recited over a cup of wine accompanied by a spice box and candle.

<headtitle>The Jewish holidays</headtitle>


-<p>
The major Jewish holidays are the Pilgrim Festivals—Pesaḥ (
<xref topicid="445894" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623322">Passover</xref>
), 
<xref topicid="539030" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623321">Shavuot</xref>
(Feast of Weeks, or Pentecost), and 
<xref topicid="572270" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623323">Sukkoth</xref>
(Tabernacles)—and the High Holidays—
<xref topicid="510009" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623325">Rosh Hashana </xref>
(New Year) and 
<xref topicid="653569" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623326">Yom Kippur</xref>
(
<xref topicid="653569" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Day of Atonement</xref>
). The observance of all the major holidays is required by the Torah and work is prohibited for the duration of the holiday (except on the intermediary days of the Pesaḥ and Sukkoth festivals, when work is permitted to avoid financial loss). 
<xref topicid="483999" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623327">Purim</xref>
(
<xref topicid="483999" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Feast of Lots</xref>
) and 
<xref topicid="254643" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623329">Hanukkah</xref>
(Feast of Dedication), while not mentioned in the Torah (and therefore of lesser solemnity), were instituted by Jewish authorities in the Persian and Greco-Roman periods. They are sometimes regarded as minor festivals because they lack the work restrictions of the major festivals. In addition, there are the five fasts—ʿAsara be-Ṭevet (Fast of Ṭevet 10), Shivaʿ ʿAsar be-Tammuz (
<xref topicid="582051" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Fast of Tammuz</xref>
17), Tisha be-Av (
<xref topicid="596967" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Fast of Av 9</xref>
), 
<xref topicid="227660" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Tzom Gedaliahu</xref>
(Fast of Gedaliah), and Taʿanit Esther (Fast of Esther)—and the lesser holidays (i.e., holidays the observances of which are few and not always clearly defined)—such as Rosh Ḥodesh (First Day of the Month), 
<xref topicid="608007" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623331">Ṭu bi-Shevaṭ</xref>
(15th of Shevaṭ: 
<xref topicid="608007" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">New Year for Trees</xref>
), and
<xref topicid="327739" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623330"> Lag ba-ʿOmer </xref>
(33rd Day of the ʿOmer Counting). The fasts and the lesser holidays, like the minor festivals, lack the work restrictions characteristic of the major festivals. Although some of the fasts and Rosh Ḥodesh are mentioned in Scripture, most of the details concerning their proper observance, as well as those concerning the other lesser holidays, were provided by the Talmudic and medieval rabbis.

<xref topicid="460429" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Pilgrim Festivals</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
In Temple times, all males were required to appear at the Temple three times annually and actively participate in the festal offerings and celebrations. These were the joyous 
<xref topicid="460429" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Pilgrim Festivals</xref>
of Pesaḥ, Shavuot, and Sukkoth. They originally marked the major agricultural seasons in ancient Israel and commemorated Israel’s early history; but, after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, emphasis was placed almost exclusively on the commemorative aspect. 
</p>


-<p>
In modern Israel, 
<xref topicid="445894" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Pesaḥ</xref>
, Shavuot, and Sukkoth are celebrated for seven days, one day, and eight days, respectively (with Shemini Atzeret added to Sukkoth), as prescribed by Scripture. Due to calendrical uncertainties that arose in Second Temple times (6th century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
to 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
), each festival is celebrated for an additional day in the Diaspora. 
</p>


-<p>
Pesaḥ commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and the servitude that preceded it. As such, it is the most significant of the commemorative holidays, for it celebrates the very inception of the Jewish people—i.e., the event which provided the basis for the covenant between God and Israel. The term 
<e>pesaḥ</e>
refers originally to the paschal (Passover) lamb sacrificed on the eve of the Exodus, the blood of which marked the Jewish homes to be spared from God’s plague; its etymological significance, however, remains uncertain. The Hebrew root is usually rendered “passed over”—i.e., God passed over the homes of the Israelites when inflicting the last plague on the Egyptians—hence the term Passover. The festival is also called Ḥag or Matzot (“Festival of Unleavened Bread”), for unleavened bread is the only kind of bread consumed during Passover. 
</p>


-<p>
Leaven (
<e>seʾor</e>
) and foods containing leaven (
<e>ḥametz</e>
) are neither to be owned nor consumed during Pesaḥ. Aside from meats, fresh fruits, and vegetables, it is customary to consume only food prepared under rabbinic supervision and labelled “
<xref topicid="322673" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">kosher</xref>
for Passover,” warranting that they are completely free of contact with leaven. In many homes, special sets of crockery, cutlery, and cooking utensils are acquired for Passover use. On the evening preceding the 14th day of Nisan, the home is thoroughly searched for any trace of leaven (
<e>bediqat ḥametz</e>
). The following morning the remaining particles of leaven are destroyed by fire (
<e>biʿur ḥametz</e>
). From then until after Pesaḥ, no leaven is consumed. Many Jews sell their more valuable leaven products to non-Jews before Passover (
<e>mekhirat ḥametz</e>
), repurchasing the foodstuffs immediately after the holiday. 
</p>


-<p>
The unleavened bread (
<xref topicid="369865" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">matzo</xref>
) consists entirely of flour and water, and great care is taken to prevent any fermentation before baking. Hand-baked 
<xref topicid="369865" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">matzo</xref>
is flat, rounded, and perforated. Since the 19th century, many Jews have preferred the square-shaped, machine-made matzo.

Passover eve is ushered in at the synagogue service on the evening before Passover, after which each family partakes of the 

-<xref topicid="688671" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623433">

<e>seder</e>

</xref>
(“order of service”), an elaborate festival meal in which every ritual is regulated by the rabbis. (In the Diaspora the seder is also celebrated on the second evening of Passover.) The table is bedecked with an assortment of foods symbolizing the passage from slavery (e.g., bitter herbs) into freedom (e.g., wine). The 
<xref topicid="251535" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623431">Haggada</xref>
(“Storytelling”), a printed manual comprising appropriate passages culled from Scripture, Talmud, and Midrash accompanied by medieval hymns, serves as a guide for the ensuing ceremonies and is recited as the evening proceeds. The seder opens with the cup of sanctification (
<xref topicid="317334" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kiddush</xref>
), the first of four cups of wine drunk by the celebrants. An invitation is extended to the needy to join the seder ceremonies, after which the youngest son asks four prescribed questions expressing his surprise at the many departures from usual mealtime procedure. (“How different this night is from all other nights!”) The father then explains that the Jews were once slaves in Egypt, were then liberated by God, and now commemorate the servitude and freedom by means of the seder ceremonies. Special blessings are recited over the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs (
<e>maror</e>
), after which the main courses are served. The meal closes with a serving of matzo recalling the paschal lamb, consumption of which concluded the meal in Temple times. The seder concludes with the joyous recital of hymns praising God’s glorious acts in history and anticipating a messianic redemption to come. 
</p>


-<p>
The Passover liturgy is considerably expanded and includes the daily recitation of Psalms 113–118 (Hallel, “Praise”), public readings from the Torah, and an additional service (

-<e>

<xref topicid="398465" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">musaf</xref>

</e>
). On the first day of Pesaḥ, a prayer for dew in the 
<xref topicid="439645" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Holy Land</xref>
is recited; on the last day, the memorial service for the departed (

-<e>

<xref topicid="653361" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">yizkor</xref>

</e>
) is added. 
</p>


-<p>
Originally an agricultural festival marking the wheat harvest, 
<xref topicid="539030" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shavuot</xref>
commemorates the revelation of the Torah on 
<xref topicid="545577" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mount Sinai</xref>
. Shavuot (“Weeks”) takes its name from the seven weeks of grain harvest separating Passover and Shavuot. The festival is also called Ḥag ha-Qazir (Harvest Festival) and Yom ha-Bikkurim (Day of First Fruits). Greek-speaking Jews called it 
<e>pentēkostē,</e>
meaning “the fiftieth” day after the sheaf offering. In rabbinic literature, Shavuot is called 
<e>atzeret</e>
(“cessation” or “conclusion”), perhaps because the cessation of work is one of its distinctive features, or possibly because it was viewed as concluding the Passover season. In liturgical texts it is described as the “season of the giving of our Torah.” The association of Shavuot with the revelation at Sinai, while not attested in Scripture, is alluded to in the 
<xref topicid="481201" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623434">Pseudepigrapha</xref>
(a collection of noncanonical writings); in rabbinic literature it first appears in 2nd-century materials. The association, probably an ancient one, was derived in part from the book of Exodus, which dates the revelation at Sinai to the third month (counting from Nisan)—i.e., Sivan. 
</p>

<p>Scripture does not provide an absolute date for Shavuot. Instead, 50 days (or seven weeks) are reckoned from the day the sheaf offering (ʿOmer) of the harvest was brought to the Temple, the 50th day being Shavuot. According to the Talmudic rabbis, the sheaf offering was brought on the 16th of Nisan; hence Shavuot always fell on or about the 6th of Sivan. Some Jewish sectarians, such as the Sadducees, rejected the rabbinic tradition concerning the date of the sheaf ceremony, preferring a later date, and celebrated Shavuot accordingly.</p>


-<p>
In Temple times, aside from the daily offerings, festival offerings, and first-fruit gifts, a special cereal consisting of two breads prepared from the new wheat crop was offered at the Temple. Since the destruction of the Second Temple, Shavuot observances have been dominated by its commemorative aspect. Many Jews spend the entire Shavuot night studying Torah, a custom first mentioned in the 
<e>Zohar</e>
(“Book of Splendour”), a Kabbalistic work edited and published in the 13th–14th centuries. Some prefer to recite the 
<e>tiqqun lel Shavuʿot</e>
(“Shavuot night service”), an anthology of passages from Scripture and the Mishna (the authoritative compilation of the Oral Law). An expanded liturgy includes 
<xref topicid="252790" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hallel</xref>
, public readings from the Torah, 
<e>yizkor</e>
(in many congregations), and 
<e>musaf</e>
. The 
<xref topicid="514202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Ruth</xref>
is read at the synagogue service, possibly because of its harvest-season setting. 
</p>


-<p>
Sukkoth (“Booths”), an ancient harvest festival that commemorates the booths the Israelites resided in after the Exodus, was the most prominent of the three Pilgrim Festivals in ancient Israel. Also called Ḥag ha-Asif (Festival of Ingathering), it has retained its joyous, festive character through the ages. It begins on Tishri 15 and is celebrated for seven days. The concluding eighth day (plus a ninth day in the Diaspora), Shemini Atzeret, is a separate holiday. In Temple times, each day of 
<xref topicid="572270" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sukkoth</xref>
had its own prescribed number of sacrificial offerings. Other observances, recorded in the Mishna tractate 
<e>Sukka</e>
, include the daily recitation of Hallel, daily circumambulation of the Temple altar, a daily water libation ceremony, and the nightly 
<e>bet ha-shoʾeva</e>
or 
<e>bet ha-sheʾuvah</e>
(“place of water drawing”) festivities starting on the evening preceding the second day. The last-mentioned observance features torch dancing, flute playing, and other forms of musical and choral entertainment. 
</p>


-<p>
Ideally, Jews are to reside in booths—walled structures covered with thatched roofs—for the duration of the festival; in practice, most observant Jews take their meals in the 
<e>sukka</e>
(“booth”) but reside at home. A palm-tree branch (
<e>lulav</e>
) bound up together with myrtle (
<e>hadas</e>
) and willow (
<e>ʿarava</e>
) branches is held together with a citron (

-<e>

<xref topicid="194567" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">etrog</xref>

</e>
) and waved. Medieval exegetes provided ample (if not always persuasive) justification for the Bible’s choice of these particular branches and fruit as symbols of rejoicing. The numerous regulations governing the 
<e>sukka</e>
, 
<e>lulav</e>
, and 
<e>etrog</e>
constitute the major portion of the treatment of Sukkoth in the codes of Jewish law. The daily Sukkoth liturgy includes the recitation of 
<xref topicid="252790" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623435">Hallel</xref>
(Psalms, 113–118), public readings from the Torah, the 
<e>musaf</e>
service, and the circumambulation of the synagogue dais. On the last day of Sukkoth, called Hoshana Rabba (Great Hoshana) after the first words of a prayer (
<e>hoshana</e>
, “save us”) recited then, seven such circumambulations take place. Kabbalistic (mystical) teaching has virtually transformed Hoshana Rabba into a solemn day of judgment. 
</p>


-<p>
Hoshana Rabba is followed by 
<xref topicid="539813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shemini Atzeret</xref>
(
<xref topicid="539813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly</xref>
), which is celebrated on Tishri 22 (in the Diaspora also Tishri 23). None of the more distinctive Sukkoth observances apply to Shemini Atzeret; but Hallel, public reading from the Torah, 
<e>yizkor</e>
(in many congregations), 
<e>musaf</e>
, and a prayer for rain in the Holy Land are included in its liturgy. 
<xref topicid="545087" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Simḥat Torah</xref>
(
<xref topicid="545087" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rejoicing of the Law</xref>
) marks the annual completion of the cycle of public readings from the Torah. The festival originated shortly before the gaonic period (
<e>c.</e>
600–1050 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) in Babylon, where it was customary to conclude the public readings annually. In Palestine, where the public readings were concluded approximately every three years, Simḥat Torah was not celebrated annually until after the gaonic period. Israeli Jews celebrate Simḥat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on the same day; in the Diaspora, Simḥat Torah is celebrated on the second day of Shemini Atzeret. Its joyous celebrations bring the Sukkoth season to an appropriate close.

<xref topicid="510009" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Rosh Hashana</xref>
is celebrated on the first two days of Tishri.

After the calendar was fixed in 359, it was regularly celebrated in Palestine on Tishri 1 until the 12th century, when Provençal scholars introduced the two-day observance.

The most distinctive Rosh Hashana observance is the sounding of the ram’s horn (
<xref topicid="541413" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">shofar</xref>
) at the synagogue service. Medieval commentators suggest that the blasts acclaim God as ruler of the universe, recall the divine revelation at Sinai, and call for spiritual reawakening and repentance. An expanded New Year liturgy stresses God’s sovereignty, his concern for humankind, and his readiness to forgive those who repent. On the first day of Rosh Hashana (except when it falls on the Sabbath) it is customary for Jews to recite penitential prayers at a river, symbolically casting their sins into it; this ceremony is called 

-<e>

<xref topicid="583856" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">tashlikh</xref>

</e>
(“thou wilt cast”). Other symbolic ceremonies, such as eating bread and apples dipped in honey, accompanied with prayers for a “sweet” and propitious year, are performed at the festive meals. 
</p>


-<p>
The most solemn of the Jewish festivals, 
<xref topicid="653569" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Yom Kippur</xref>
is a day when sins are confessed and expiated and 
<xref topicid="275376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human beings</xref>
and God are believed to be reconciled. It is also the last of the Days of Judgment and the holiest day of the Jewish year. Celebrated on Tishri 10, it is marked by fasting, penitence, and prayer. Work, eating, drinking, washing, anointing one’s body, 
<xref topicid="537163" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sexual intercourse</xref>
, and wearing leather shoes are all forbidden. 
</p>


-<p>
In Temple times, Yom Kippur provided the only occasion for the entry of the high priest into the 
<xref topicid="269840" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638750">Holy of Holies</xref>
(the innermost and most sacred area of the Temple); details of the expiatory rites performed by the high priest and others are recorded in the Mishna and recounted in the liturgy. Present-day observances begin with a festive meal shortly before Yom Kippur eve. The 
<xref topicid="321300" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Kol Nidre</xref>
prayer (recited before the evening service) is a legal formula that absolves Jews from fulfilling solemn vows, thus safeguarding them from accidentally violating a vow’s stipulations. The formula first appears in gaonic sources (derived from the Babylonian Talmudic academies, 6th–11th centuries) but may be older; the haunting melody that accompanies it is of medieval origin. Virtually the entire day is spent in prayer at the synagogue; the closing service (
<e>neʿila</e>
) concludes with the sounding of the ram’s horn.

(reigned 175–164

. Led by Mattathias and his son

(died 
<e>c.</e>
161 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), the Maccabees were the first Jews who fought to defend their religious beliefs rather than their lives. Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days beginning on Kislev 25. The Hanukkah lamp, or candelabra (
<xref topicid="375222" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">menorah</xref>
), which recalls the Temple lampstand, is kindled each evening. One candle is lit on the first evening, and an additional candle is lit on each subsequent evening until eight candles are burning on the last evening. According to the Talmud (
<e>Shabbat</e>
21b), the ritually pure 
<xref topicid="426111" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">oil</xref>
available at the rededication of the Temple was sufficient for only one day’s light but miraculously lasted for eight days; hence the eight-day celebration. Evidence from the Apocrypha (writings excluded from the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jewish canon</xref>
but included in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox canons) and from rabbinic literature shows an association between Hanukkah and Sukkoth, possibly accounting for the former’s eight-day duration. The celebration of Hanukkah includes festive meals, songs, games, and gifts to children. The liturgy includes Hallel, public readings from the Torah, and the 
<e>ʿal ha-nissim</e>
(“for the miracles”) prayer. The Scroll of Antiochus, an early medieval account of Hanukkah, is read in some synagogues and homes.

, king of Persia, 486–465 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
). Mordecai and his cousin Esther, the king’s Jewish wife, interceded on behalf of the Jewish community, rescinded the royal edict authorizing a massacre of the Jews, and instituted the Purim festival. The historicity of the biblical account is questioned by many modern scholars. It is now generally conceded that the 
<xref topicid="193471" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Esther</xref>
was written in the Persian period (it contains Persian but not Greek words) and reflects Persian custom. Except for the Book of Esther, the earliest mention of the Purim festival is from the 2nd–1st centuries

In most Jewish communities, Purim is celebrated on Adar 14 (some also celebrate it on the 15th, others only on the 15th). On the evening preceding Purim, men, women, and children gather in the synagogue to hear the Book of Esther read from a scroll (
<e>megilla</e>
). The reading is repeated on Purim morning. A festive meal during the day is accompanied by much song, wine, and merriment. Masquerades, Purim plays, and other forms of parody are common. Friends exchange gifts of foodstuffs and also present gifts to the poor. Aside from the Esther readings, the liturgy includes public reading from the Torah and recital of the Purim version of the 
<e>ʿal ha-nissim</e>
prayer.

-<p>
Each of the fasts of the Jewish religious year recognizes an important event in the history of the Jewish people and Judaism. ʿAsara be-Ṭevet (Fast of Ṭevet 10) commemorates the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem by 
<xref topicid="407575" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623457">Nebuchadrezzar II</xref>
, king of Babylonia, in 588

. Shivaʿ ʿAsar be-Tammuz (Fast of Tammuz 17) commemorates the first breach in the wall of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. It initiates three weeks of semi-mourning that culminate with 
<xref topicid="596967" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Tisha be-Av</xref>
. Tisha be-Av (Fast of Av 9) commemorates the destruction of the First and Second Temples in 586 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
and 70 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. The most solemn of the five fasts, its self-denials are more rigorous than those prescribed for the others, and, like Yom Kippur, the fast begins at sunset. The book of Lamentations is read at the evening service, followed by poetic laments that are also recited on Tisha be-Av morning. Tzom Gedaliahu (
<xref topicid="227660" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Fast of Gedaliah</xref>
) commemorates the slaying of Gedaliah, governor of Judah after the destruction of the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">First Temple</xref>
. Taʿanit Esther (Fast of Esther), which commemorates Esther’s fast (
<e>compare</e>
Esther 4:16), is first mentioned in gaonic literature. The commemorative apsects of the fasts are closely associated with their penitential aspects, all of which find expression in the liturgy. Thus, Jews not only relive the tragic history of their people with each fast but are also afforded an opportunity to search within themselves and focus on their own (and their people’s) present and future. Penitential prayers (
<e>seliḥot</e>
) are recited on all fasts, and the Torah is read at the morning and afternoon services.

<headtitle>The situation today</headtitle>


-<p>
Modern attitudes toward the Sabbath and festivals vary considerably. Western secular Jews often are ignorant of, or choose to neglect, traditional observances. Attitudes of committed Jews in the Western world mostly reflect accepted Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform practice; for example, driving to synagogue services on the Sabbath is unthinkable in Orthodox circles, a matter of dispute among Conservative rabbis, and common practice for Reform Jews. Among Orthodox Jews, who best preserve the traditional observances, contemporary discussion centres mostly on technological advances and their effect on Halakhic practice. Whether or not 
<xref topicid="258306" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">hearing aids</xref>
may be worn on the Sabbath and how crossing the international dateline affects the observance of Sabbaths and festivals typify the sort of problem addressed in Orthodox 
<e>responsa</e>
(“replies” to questions on law and observance). Discussion in modern Conservative literature has raised the possibility of abolishing the obligatory character of the additional festival days in the Diaspora (except for the second day of Rosh Hashana), thus unifying Jewish practice throughout the world. Reform Jews, the most innovative of the three groups, observe neither the additional festival days (including the second day of Rosh Hashana) nor the fasts and have modified the liturgy and the observances of the holidays. More-radical Reform congregations have experimented freely with sound and light effects and other novel forms of synagogue service. 
</p>


-<p>
In Israel the Sabbath is the national day of rest, and Jewish holidays are vacation periods. Municipal ordinances govern public observance of the Sabbath and festivals; their enactment and enforcement vary with the political influence of the local Orthodox Jewish community. Attempts to interpret festivals along nationalistic lines are common; some 
<xref topicid="317247" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1623485">kibbutzim</xref>
(communal farms) stress the agricultural significance of the festivals. Independence Day is a national holiday; the preceding day, Remembrance Day, commemorates Israel’s war dead. Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Remembrance and Heroism Day)—marking the systematic destruction of European Jewry between 1933 and 1945 and recalling the short-lived ghetto uprisings—is observed officially on Nisan 27, but many religious Israelis prefer to observe it on Ṭebet 10 (a fast day), now called Yom HaKaddish Haklali (the day on which the mourner’s prayer is recited). Since the Six-Day War of June 1967, Iyyar 28—Liberation of Jerusalem Day—is celebrated unofficially by many Israelis (
<e>see</e>

<xref topicid="31439" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638756">Arab-Israeli wars</xref>
). Appropriate services are conducted on all the aforementioned holidays by most segments of Israel’s religious community. 
</p>

<p>In Israel and the Diaspora, Jewish theologians often stress the timelessness and contemporaneity of holiday observances. Nevertheless, “revised” Passover Haggadot (plural of Haggada), in which contemporary issues are accorded a central position, appear regularly.</p>

<headtitle>The anti-iconic principle and its modifications</headtitle>


-<p>
Although the 
<xref topicid="587032" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Second Commandment</xref>
(Exodus 20:4; Deuteronomy 5:8), “You shall not make yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth,” has been understood as absolutely prohibiting any and all artistic representation, this is not the only possible interpretation of these words. What is intended is a prohibition against the construction of idols, which were objects of worship in the 
<xref topicid="146313" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">cultural area</xref>
in which the Israelites dwelt. Even in the Bible there are reports of artistic activity in the construction of the tent sanctuary and its ritual vessels (Exodus 25–31) and of the Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6–7). The literalness with which the commandment was interpreted depended on the larger situation of the community, so that when there was external pressure toward religious conformity, such as during the reign of 
<xref topicid="28380" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</xref>
in Antioch (175–164 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
), the anti-iconic attitude sharpened. During the Roman occupation of Israel, the presence of battle standards containing animal representations was looked upon as an affront, while extreme pietists would not even handle Roman coinage because of the images stamped on it. On the other hand, the walls of a 3rd-century-
<e ty="s">ce</e>
synagogue in Dura-Europus in Syria are covered from floor to ceiling with biblical scenes including human representations, and a number of synagogues in Palestine had elaborate mosaic floors decorated with the signs of the zodiac, representations of the seasons, and the like. Further, 
<xref topicid="283009" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">illuminated manuscripts</xref>
from medieval Europe were frequently decorated with biblical figures, some quite clearly copied from Christian prototypes. There is also a fascinating image in a 
<xref topicid="251535" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Haggada</xref>
in which the human figures have bird heads. Synagogues from a later—though pre-emancipation—period (before the 18th century) were often decorated with animal representations. In the modern period the use of human representations has not been completely avoided, though nothing like the decorations of

All these vary in artistic quality, from the work of simple artisans to exquisitely produced works of master craftsmen.

<headtitle>Architecture</headtitle>


-<p>
The building of 
<xref topicid="578206" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">synagogues</xref>
too is an expression of artistic interest and concern, as well as of religious and social function. Nothing is known of these edifices, if indeed there were any, until the Greco-Roman period. Then the Roman basilica often provided the appropriate model, because the basilican design incorporated what the synagogue required, including a spacious hall and galleries (for women). Whenever possible, synagogues were built on hilltops. At the front of the synagogue was a walled entrance court with a fountain for ablutions. Before it was destroyed, the Temple may have been oriented with its doors facing eastward, but after it was rebuilt they faced Jerusalem; still later, when the holy 
<xref topicid="34867" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ark</xref>
containing the Torah scrolls was placed in a fixed position, the orientation was reversed so that the central gate would not be blocked. Ultimately, however, the ark was placed in or against the east wall, without reference to the actual direction of Jerusalem. As the Diaspora grew larger, the new communities adapted the architectural forms of the surrounding culture. Many of the surviving buildings of the Muslim period in Spain have horseshoe arches and are decorated with the exquisite stucco arabesques that mark the era. The medieval period in Christian Europe saw a revival of a very strict anti-iconic attitude and a gradual rejection of the church edifice in favour of secular buildings as a model for the synagogue. 
</p>


-<p>
The increasingly limited role of the Jew in western European society and the enlargement of restrictions by 
<xref topicid="117123" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">church and state</xref>
made it necessary to modify the structure of the synagogue. The doors no longer were in the wall facing the ark, the courtyard grew smaller, galleries were discontinued and side rooms served as the women’s section, and a double- rather than a triple-aisled construction was largely favoured. Similar developments took place in eastern Europe with the building of fortress-synagogues and the remarkable wooden synagogues of Poland. In the late 18th and the early 19th century, Baroque style had its day, followed by styles imitating Greek temples; Romanesque, Gothic, and Byzantine churches; and Moorish mosques. The various schools of functionalism and their commercial descendants have also influenced synagogue design. The best of these have brought together fine architectural design and beautifully conceived and executed decoration. The interior arrangement, even in some traditional synagogues, has been influenced by the Protestant sermon-centred form of worship, so that some of the unique forms that marked older structures are absent. The holy ark is, however, still a centre of attention and has often been treated in interesting and striking ways.

The use of paintings in the decoration of synagogues goes back to at least the 3rd century

During the synagogue service, the

, or 
<xref topicid="93248" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">cantor</xref>
, reads the service and declaims the scriptural lessons to certain set musical modes that vary with the season and occasion. Many of these call for melodic responses on the part of the congregation. The origins of these chants are ancient, often obscure, and equally complicated. Whatever the basic materials may have been, they were enlarged, varied, and reworked through the centuries in the various environments in which the Jews lived. In modern times, musicologists began to examine the history of synagogal music, analyzing its basic structures and its relationship to the music of Christian liturgical traditions. In the 19th century in western Europe, much of the traditional synagogal music was either discarded or reworked under the influence of Western forms and styles. The introduction of the 
<xref topicid="431866" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">pipe organ</xref>

<headtitle>Literature</headtitle>


-<p>
Literature has been the home of Jewish artistic activity throughout the ages. The 
<xref topicid="259083" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
is a work of monumental artistry, exhibiting grandeur of form and language in historical narrative, poetry, rhetoric, law, and aphorism. The extra-scriptural writings of the period disclose literary genius of a high order in translation, though in many cases the original works have vanished. Although the documents of the rabbinic tradition are not often regarded as having great literary worth, much of the material, particularly the Haggadic portions of the Midrashim, reveals a noteworthy sensitivity to language. In the medieval period, much attention was given to the production of 
<e>piyyuṭim</e>
, liturgical poetry with which to embellish the 
<xref topicid="542941" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">siddur</xref>
(prayer book), itself a collection containing much imaginative as well as pedestrian writing. In the 
<xref topicid="295765" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islamic world</xref>
, under the influence of Arabic poetry, Hebrew poetry rose to great heights in both liturgical and secular forms. Important works of history written in the medieval Rhineland chronicled and commented on Jewish suffering during the 
<xref topicid="144695" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638777">Crusade</xref>
s. The beginnings of the Jewish form of Middle High German also appeared in this period; through the centuries it developed into an autonomous Jewish language, 
<xref topicid="653224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1758489">Yiddish</xref>
, which became a literary vehicle of very high order in the 19th century. The re-creation of Hebrew as a literary language also began in the 19th century; it became the basis of the spoken vernacular of the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">State of Israel</xref>
and of a flourishing literature. After the emancipation at the end of the 18th century, Jews in western Europe and later in the 
<xref topicid="616563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">United States</xref>
turned to literature in the vernaculars of their countries and produced writers of note who dealt with both Jewish and general themes.

The term 

-<e>

<xref topicid="839970" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jewish philosophy</xref>

</e>
refers to various kinds of reflection engaged in by persons identified as Jews. At times, as in the Middle Ages, this meant any methodical and disciplined thought pursued by Jews, whether on general philosophical subjects or on specifically Judaic themes. In other eras, as in modern times, concentration on the latter has been considered a decisive criterion, so that philosophers who are Jewish but unconcerned with Judaism or the Jewish heritage and destiny in their thought are not ordinarily classified as Jewish philosophers.

Philosophy arose in Judaism under Greek influence; however, a kind of philosophical approach may be discerned in early Jewish religious works apparently subject to little or no Greek influence. The books of

and 
<xref topicid="177756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ecclesiastes</xref>
(Hebrew: 
<e>Qohelet</e>
) were favourite works of medieval philosophers, who took them as philosophical discussions not dependent on historical revelation. 
<xref topicid="480617" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">The book of Proverbs</xref>
introduces, in an apparently theological context, the concept of Wisdom (Ḥokhma), which was to have a primordial significance for Jewish thought, and presents it as the first and favourite of God’s creations. It is also praised, in the book of the 
<xref topicid="177810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach</xref>
(
<xref topicid="177810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ecclesiasticus</xref>
), as instilled by God into all his works and granted in abundance to those he loves. It is sometimes equated with fearing God and keeping the Law. In other passages, however, piety seems to be regarded as superior to Wisdom. The 
<xref topicid="553548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Wisdom of Solomon</xref>
, probably originally written in Greek, praises Wisdom, which is held to be an image of God’s goodness and a reflection of the eternal light. God is said to have given the author knowledge of the composition of the world, the powers, the elements, the nature of animals, the divisions of time, and the positions of the stars. In its vocabulary and perhaps in some of its doctrines, the work shows the influence of Greek philosophy. It also has had considerable influence on Christian theology.

<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Philo Judaeus</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
The first systematic attempt to apply Greek philosophical concepts to Jewish doctrines was made by 
<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620795">Philo Judaeus</xref>
(
<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Philo of Alexandria</xref>
) in the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
. Philo was influenced by Platonic and Stoic writings and probably also by certain postbiblical Jewish beliefs and speculations. He apparently had some knowledge of the Oral Law, which was developing in his time, and he also knew of the Essenes, whom he praised highly. 
</p>


-<p>
Philo provided Jewish religious doctrines with intellectual and cultural respectability by stating them in Greek philosophical terms. He also showed that much of Greek philosophy was consonant with Judaism as he conceived it and with the allegorical sense of biblical texts as he read them. The fact that he stressed the primacy of Jewish religious tradition over Greek philosophy may have been more than mere lip service. It may be argued that—in central points of his thought, such as his conception of 
<xref topicid="346460" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Logos</xref>
(the Divine Reason or Word)—Philo used philosophical notions as expressions of religious beliefs. For him, Logos is primarily an intermediary between a transcendent, unknowable God and the world. On basic philosophical and theological problems, such as the creation of the world or the existence of 
<xref topicid="218436" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638783">free will</xref>
(
<e>see also</e>

<xref topicid="159526" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638784">determinism</xref>
), Philo’s writings provide vague or contradictory answers. He placed mystic ecstasy, of which he may have had personal experience, above philosophical and theological speculations. 
</p>

<p>Philo’s approach, his method of interpretation, his way of thinking, as well as some of his ideas—especially that of Logos—exerted considerable influence on early Christian thought but not, to any comparable extent, on Jewish thought in the same period. In the Middle Ages, knowledge of Philo among Jews was either very slight or nonexistent. Not until modern times was his importance in the history of Jewish religious thought recognized.</p>

<headtitle>Medieval philosophy</headtitle>


-<p>
In the 9th and 10th centuries, after a long hiatus, systematic philosophy and ideology reappeared among the Jews, a phenomenon indicative of their contacts with 
<xref topicid="295765" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islamic</xref>
civilization. The evolution of Islam in the 9th and 10th centuries showed that Greek scientific and philosophical lore could be separated, at least to some extent, from its pagan associations and could be adapted to another language and another culture. It also showed that a monotheistic, prophetic religion that in all relevant essentials, including adherence to a basic religious law, was closely akin to Judaism could be the basis of a culture in which science, philosophy, and theology were an indispensable part. The question of whether philosophy is compatible with religious law (the answer sometimes being negative) constituted the main theme of the foremost medieval Jewish thinkers. From approximately the 9th to the 13th century, Jewish thought participated in the evolution of 
<xref topicid="295736" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islamic philosophy</xref>
and theology and manifested only in a limited sense a specifically Jewish character. Jewish philosophers showed no particular preference for philosophical texts written by Jewish authors over those composed by Muslims, and in many cases the significant works of Jewish thinkers constituted a reply or a reaction to the ideas of Islamic philosophical and scientific writings.

), is modeled on similar Muʿtazilite treatises and on the Muʿtazilite classification of theological subject matter known as the 
<xref topicid="440932" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Five Principles</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
Like many Muʿtazilite authors, Saʿadia set forth in his introduction a list and theory of the various sources of knowledge. He distinguished four sources: (1) the five senses, (2) the intellect, or reason, (3) necessary inferences, and (4) reliable information given by trustworthy persons. In Saʿadia’s sense of the word, intellect, or reason (
<e>al-ʿaql</e>
), is an immediate, a priori cognition, independent of sense experience. In 
<e>Beliefs and Opinions</e>
the intellect is characterized as having immediate ethical cognitions—that is, as discerning what is good and what is evil—in opposition to the medieval Aristotelians, who did not regard even the most general ethical rules as knowable a priori. The third source of knowledge comprises inferences of the type “if there is smoke, there is fire,” which are based on data furnished by the first two sources of knowledge. The fourth source of knowledge is meant to validate the teachings of Scripture and of the religious tradition, which must be regarded as true because of the trustworthiness of the men who propounded them. One of the work’s main purposes was to show that the knowledge deriving from the fourth source concords with that discovered by means of the other three—i.e., that religion and human reason agree. 
</p>


-<p>
Saʿadia opposed Aristotle’s view that the natural order was eternal. He held, with other partisans of the Muʿtazilite 
<e>kalām</e>
, that the demonstration of the temporal creation of the world must precede and pave the way for the proof of the existence of God the Creator. Given the demonstrated truth that the world has a beginning in time, it can be proved that it could have been produced only through the action of a creator. It can further be proved that there must have been only one creator. 
</p>


-<p>
The theology of Saʿadia, like that of the Muʿtazilites, hinges on two principles: the unity of God and the principle of justice. The latter takes issue with the view (widespread in Islam and present also in Judaism) that the definition of what is just and what is good depends solely on God’s will, to which none of the moral criteria found among 
<xref topicid="275376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human beings</xref>
are applicable. According to this view, a revelation from God can convert an action generally recognized as evil into a good action. Against this way of thinking, Saʿadia and the Muʿtazilites believed that being good and just or being evil and unjust are intrinsic characteristics of human actions and cannot be changed by divine decree. The notions of justice and of good, as conceived by humans, are binding even on God himself. Indeed, the ethical cognitions of humans are the same as those of the Deity. 
</p>


-<p>
Saʿadia also addressed the issue of the function of religious law. Of central importance in traditional Judaism and Islam, the law was thought to have been established to compel humans to perform good actions and avoid bad ones. Because Saʿadia believed that humans have 
<xref topicid="117" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">a priori knowledge</xref>
of good and evil and that this knowledge coincides with the principles underlying the most important portions of the revealed law, he was forced to ask whether this law is not superfluous. He could, however, point out that, whereas the human intellect recognizes that certain actions—for instance, murder or theft—are evil, it cannot by itself discover the best definition of what constitutes a particular transgression; nor can it, on its own, determine an appropriate punishment. On both points, Saʿadia asserted, the commandments of religious law give the best possible answers. 
</p>

<p>Saʿadia called the commandments that accord with the behests of the human intellect the intellectual, or rational, commandments. According to him, they include the duty of manifesting gratitude to the Creator for the benefits he has bestowed upon humans. Saʿadia recognized that a considerable number of commandments—for instance, those dealing with the prohibition of work on the Sabbath—do not belong to this category. He held, however, that the obligation to obey them can be derived from the rational commandment that humans must be grateful to God, for such gratitude entails obedience to his orders.</p>

Saʿadia’s adoption of the rational Muʿtazilite theology was a part of his overall effort to consolidate rabbinical Judaism (based on the Mishna and Talmud), which was being attacked by the 
<xref topicid="311998" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620859">Karaites</xref>
. This Jewish sect, founded by 
<xref topicid="22658" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620860">Anan ben David</xref>
in the 8th century, rejected the authority of the Oral Law and the commentaries on it—that is, of the Mishna and the Talmud. In the 10th century and afterward, the Karaites accepted as their guides the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
and human reason, in the Muʿtazilite sense of the word. Their repudiation of postbiblical Jewish religious tradition facilitated a rational approach to theological doctrine. This approach led Karaite authors to criticize the adherents of rabbinical Judaism for holding anthropomorphic beliefs based in part on texts of the Talmudic period. Karaite authors propounded, in conceptual terms, a theology of Jewish history in exile (

-<e>

<xref topicid="161756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">galut</xref>

</e>
). Life in exile is a diminished existence; nevertheless, the good or bad actions of the Jewish people (rather than their material strength or weakness) affect the course of history. Redemption may come when all Jews are converted to

The Karaites adopted Muʿtazilite 
<e>kalām</e>
wholesale, including its 
<xref topicid="41810" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638795">atomism</xref>
. The Muʿtazilite atomists held that everything that exists consists of minute, discrete parts. This applies not only to bodies but also to space, time, motion, and the “accidents”—that is, qualities, such as colour—which the Islamic and Jewish atomists regarded as being joined to the corporeal atoms but not determined by them, as had been believed by the Greek atomists. An instant of time or a unit of motion does not continue the preceding instant or unit. All apparent processes are discontinuous, and there are causal connections between their successive units of change. The fact that cotton put into fire generally burns does not mean that fire is a cause of burning; rather, it may be explained as a “habit” that has no character of necessity. God’s free will is the only agent of everything that occurs, with the exception of one category—human actions. These are causes that produce effects; for instance, one who throws a stone at someone else, who is then killed, directly brings about the latter’s death. This inconsistency on the part of the theologians was required by the principle of justice, for it would be unjust to punish someone for a murder that was a result not of this person’s action but of God’s. This grudging admission that causality exists in certain strictly defined and circumscribed cases was occasioned by moral, not physical, considerations.

<headtitle>Isaac Israeli</headtitle>


-<p>
Outside Babylonia, philosophical studies were pursued by Jews in the 9th and 10th centuries in Egypt and in the Maghrib (northwest Africa), most notably by 
<xref topicid="296884" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620909">Isaac ben Solomon Israeli</xref>
(832/855–932/955), an Egyptian-born North African who has been called “the first Jewish Neoplatonist.” In his philosophical works, such as the 
<e>Kitab al-ustuqusat</e>
(“Book of Elements”) and the 
<e>Kitab al-hudud</e>
(“Book of Definitions”), Israeli drew largely upon a 9th-century Muslim popularizer of Greek philosophy, 
<xref topicid="318068" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Abū ğūsuf Yaʿqūb al-Kindī</xref>
, and also, in all probability, upon a lost pseudo-Aristotelian text. The peculiar form of Neoplatonic doctrine that seems to have been set forth in this text had, directly and indirectly, a considerable influence on medieval Jewish philosophy. 
</p>


-<p>
According to Israeli, God creates through his will and power. The two things that were created first were form, identified with wisdom, and matter, which is designated as the genus of genera (the classes of things) and which is the substratum of everything, not only of bodies but also of incorporeal substances. This conception of matter apparently was derived from the Greek Neoplatonists 
<xref topicid="464926" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638796">Plotinus</xref>
(205–270) and 
<xref topicid="477783" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638797">Proclus</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
410–485), particularly from the latter. In Proclus’s opinion, generality was one of the main criteria for determining the ontological priority of an entity (its place in the hierarchy of being). Matter, because of its indeterminacy, obviously has a high degree of generality; consequently, it figures among the entities having ontological priority. According to the Neoplatonic view, which Israeli seems to have adopted, the conjunction of matter and form gives rise to the intellect. A light sent forth from the intellect produces the rational soul, which in turn gives rise to the vegetative soul. 
</p>

<p>Israeli was perhaps the first Jewish philosopher to attribute prophecy to the influence of the intellect on the faculty of imagination. According to Israeli, this faculty receives from the intellect spiritual forms that are intermediate between corporeality and spirituality. This explanation implies that these forms, “with which the prophets armed themselves,” are inferior to purely intellectual cognitions.</p>

and his Neoplatonic source (or sources) was taken over by 
<xref topicid="280748" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638798">Solomon ibn Gabirol</xref>
, a celebrated 11th-century Hebrew liturgical poet who was also the earliest Jewish philosopher of Spain. His chief philosophical work, written in Arabic but preserved in full only in a 12th-century Latin translation titled 
<e>Fons vitae</e>
(“Fountain of Life”), makes no reference to Judaism or to specifically Jewish doctrines and is a dialogue between a disciple and a master who teaches him true philosophical knowledge. Despite its prolixity and many contradictions, it is an impressive work. Few medieval texts so effectively communicate the Neoplatonic conception of the existence of a number of planes of being that differ according to their ontological priority, the derivative and inferior ones constituting a reflection in a grosser mode of existence of those that are prior and superior. 
</p>


-<p>
One of Ibn Gabirol’s central concerns was the divine will, which appears to be both part of and separate from the divine essence. Infinite according to its essence, the will is finite in its action. It is described as pervading everything that exists and as being the intermediary between the divine essence and matter and form. Will was one of the traditional terms used by medieval theologians to identify the entity intermediate between the transcendent Deity and the world or the aspect of the Deity involved in creation. According to a statement in 
<e>Fons vitae</e>
, matter derives from the divine essence, whereas form derives from the divine will. This suggests that the difference between matter and form has some counterpart in the Godhead and also that universal matter is superior to universal form. Some of Ibn Gabirol’s statements seem to support the superiority of universal matter; other passages, however, appear to imply the superiority of universal form. 
</p>

<p>Form and matter, whether universal or particular, exist only in conjunction. All things, with the sole exception of God, are constituted through the union of the two, the intellect no less than corporeal substance. In fact, the intellect is the first being in which universal matter and form are conjoined. The intellect contains and encompasses all things. It is through the grasp of the various planes of being, through ascending in knowledge to the world of the intellect and apprehending what is above it—the divine will and the world of the Deity—that humans may “escape death” and reach “the source of life.”</p>

-<p>

<xref topicid="307174" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620916">Judah ben Samuel ha-Levi</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1075–1141), another celebrated Hebrew poet from Spain, was the first medieval Jewish thinker to base his thought consciously and consistently on arguments drawn from Jewish history. His views are set forth in an Arabic dialogue, 
<e>al-Hazari</e>
(Hebrew 
<e>Sefer ha-Kuzari</e>
), the full title of which is translated as “The Book of Proof and Argument in Defense of the Despised Faith.” This work is usually called 
<e>Kuzari</e>
—i.e., “the 
<xref topicid="316553" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Khazar</xref>
.” 
</p>


-<p>
Basing his narrative on the historical conversion to Judaism of the 
<xref topicid="316553" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620925">Khazars</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
740), a Turkic-speaking people in central Eurasia, ha-Levi relates that their king, a pious man who did not belong to any of the great monotheistic religions, dreamed of an angel who said to him, “Your intentions are pleasing to the Creator, but your works are not.” To find the correct way to please God, the king sought guidance from a philosopher, from a Christian, from a Muslim, and finally—after hesitating to invite a representative of a people degraded by historical misfortune—from a Jewish scholar, who then converted him to Judaism. The angel’s words in the king’s dream may be regarded as a kind of revelation. Ha-Levi used this element of the story to suggest that it is not the spontaneous activity of reason that impels human beings to undertake the quest for the true religion but the gift of prophecy—or at least a touch of the prophetic faculty (or a knowledge of the revelations of the past). 
</p>

<p>The argument of the philosopher whose advice is sought by the king confirms this point. This disquisition is a brilliant piece of writing that lays bare the essential differences between the Aristotelian God, who is wholly indifferent to human individuals, and the God of the Jewish religion. The God of the philosophers, who is pure intellect, is not concerned with the works of human beings; moreover, the cultural activities to which the angel clearly refers—activities that involve both mind and body—cannot, from a philosophical point of view, either help or hinder humans in the pursuit of the philosophers’ supreme goal, the attainment of union with the active intellect, a “light” of the divine nature. This union was supposed to confer knowledge of all intelligible things on the individual; the supreme goal, therefore, was purely intellectual in nature.</p>


-<p>
In opposition to the philosopher’s faith, the religion of the Jewish scholar in the 
<e>Kuzari</e>
is based on the fact that God may have a close, direct relationship with humans, who are not conceived primarily as beings endowed with intellect. The postulate that God can have intercourse with a creature made of the disgusting materials that compose the 
<xref topicid="275485" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human body</xref>
is scandalous to the king and prevents his acceptance of the doctrine concerning prophecy, expounded by the Muslim sage (just as the extraordinary nature of the Christological dogmas deters him from adopting Christianity). 
</p>

<p>The Jewish scholar argues that it is contemplation not of the cosmos but of Jewish history that procures knowledge of God. Ha-Levi was aware of the odium attached to the doctrine of the superiority of one particular nation; he held, however, that this teaching alone explains God’s dealings with humanity, which, like many other things, reason is unable to grasp. The controversies of the philosophers serve as proof of the failure of human intelligence to find valid solutions to the most important problems.</p>

<p>Ha-Levi’s dialogue was also directed against the Karaites. He shows the necessity and celebrates the efficacy of a blind, unquestioning adhesion to tradition, which the Karaites rejected. Yet he expounds a theology of Jewish exile that seems to have been influenced by Karaite doctrine. According to ha-Levi, even in exile the course of Jewish history is not determined like that of other nations by natural causes, such as material strength or weakness; the decisive factor is whether the Jews are religiously observant or disobedient. The advent of Christianity and Islam, in his view, prepares other nations for conversion to Judaism, an event that will occur in the eschatological period at the end of history.</p>

<xref topicid="1572" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620947">Abraham bar Hiyya Savasorda</xref>

<e>Megillat ha-megalle </e>
(“Scroll of the Revealer”) a view of Jewish history that is reminiscent of ha-Levi but does not emphasize its uniqueness to the same degree; it is also set forth in much less impressive fashion. Living in Barcelona under Christian rule, Bar Hiyya wrote scientific and philosophical treatises not in Arabic but in Hebrew. Hebrew was also used by

(died 1167), a native of Spain who travelled extensively in Christian Europe.

</p>


-<p>
The last outstanding Jewish philosopher of the Islamic East, Abū al-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (who died as a very old man sometime after 1164), also belongs to this period. An inhabitant of Iraq, he was converted to Islam in his 
<xref topicid="426737" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">old age</xref>
(for reasons of expediency, according to his biographers). His philosophy appears to have had a strong impact on Islamic thought, though its influence on Jewish philosophy and theology is very hard to pin down and may be practically nonexistent. His chief philosophical work, 
<e>Kitāb al-muʿtabar</e>
(“The Book of That Which Has Been Established by Personal Reflection”), contains very few references to Jewish texts or topics. Abū al-Barakāt rejected Aristotelian physics completely. According to him, time is the measure of being and not, as Aristotle taught, the measure of motion; he also replaced Aristotle’s two-dimensional concept of place with the three-dimensional notion of space, the existence of which is independent of the existence of bodies.

<xref topicid="280733" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620951">Abraham ibn Daud</xref>
(12th century), who is regarded as the first Jewish Aristotelian of Spain, was primarily a disciple of 
<xref topicid="45755" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620952">Avicenna</xref>
, the great 11th-century Islamic philosopher. He may have translated or helped to translate some of Avicenna’s works into Latin, according to one plausible hypothesis, for he lived under Christian rule in Toledo, a town that in the 12th century was a centre for translators. His historical treatises, written in Hebrew, manifest his desire to familiarize his fellow Jews with the historical tradition of the Latin world, which at that time was alien to most of them. But his philosophical work, 
<e>Sefer ha-emuna ha-rama </e>
(“Book of Sublime Faith”), written in 1161 in Arabic, shows few if any signs of Christian influence. 
</p>

<p>The doctrine of emanation set forth in this work describes in the manner of Avicenna the procession of the 10 incorporeal intellects, the first of which derives from God. This intellect produces the second intellect, and so on. Ibn Daud questioned in a fairly explicit manner Avicenna’s views on the way the second intellect is produced; his discipleship did not mean total adherence. Ibn Daud’s psychology was also, and more distinctively, derived from Avicenna. The argumentation leading to a proof that the rational faculty is not corporeal attempts to derive the nature of the soul from the fact of immediate self-awareness. Like Avicenna, Ibn Daud founded psychology on a theory of consciousness.</p>

Ibn Daud often referred to the accord that, in his view, existed between philosophy and religious tradition. As he remarked, the 
<e>Sefer ha-emuna ha-rama</e>
was not for readers who, in their simplicity, are satisfied with what they know of religious tradition or for those who have a thorough knowledge of philosophy. It was intended for readers of one type only: those who, being acquainted with the religious tradition on the one hand and having some rudiments of philosophy on the other, are “perplexed.” It was for the same audience that

<xref topicid="358539" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses Maimonides</xref>
(Moses ben Maimon; 1135–1204), a native of Spain, is incontestably the greatest name in Jewish medieval philosophy, but his reputation is not derived from any outstanding originality in philosophical thought. Rather, the distinction of Maimonides, who is also the most eminent codifier of Jewish religious law, is to be found in the vast scope of his attempt, in the 
<e>Dalālat al-hā’irin</e>
(
<e>The Guide for the Perplexed</e>
), to safeguard both religious law and philosophy (the public communication of which would be destructive of the law) without suppressing the issues between them and without trying to impose, on a theoretical plane, a final, universally binding solution to the conflict. 
</p>


-<p>
As Maimonides states in his introduction to the 
<e>Guide</e>
, he regarded his self-imposed task as perilous, and he therefore had recourse to a whole system of precautions designed to conceal his true meaning from people who, lacking the necessary qualifications, might misread the book and abandon observance of the law. Maimonides himself notes that these precautions include deliberately contradictory statements meant to mislead the undiscerning reader. The apparent or real contradictions encountered in the 
<e>Guide</e>
are perhaps most flagrant in Maimonides’ doctrine concerning God. There seems to be no plausible hypothesis capable of explaining away the inconsistencies between the following three views: 
</p>


-<p>
1. God has an eternal will that is not bound by 
<xref topicid="406283" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">natural laws</xref>
. Through an act of his will, he created the world in time and imposed on it the order of nature. This creation is the greatest of miracles; only if it is admitted can other miracles, which interfere with the causally determined concatenations of events, be regarded as possible. The philosophers’ God, who is not free to cut the wings of a fly, is to be rejected. This conception is in keeping with the traditional religious view of God and is avowedly adopted by Maimonides because failure to do so would undermine religion. 
</p>

<p>2. Humans are incapable of having any positive knowledge concerning God. No positive attributes—e.g., wisdom or life—can be ascribed to God. Contrary to the attributes predicated of created beings, the divine attributes are strictly negative; they state what God is not. For instance, he is not not-wise, and such a statement is not a positive assertion. Hence, only a negative theology is possible—saying what God is not. The way God acts can, however, be known. This knowledge is to be found in natural science.</p>


-<p>
3. God is an intellect. The formula used by medieval philosophers—which maintains that in God the knowing subject, the object known, and the act of intellectual knowledge are identical—derives from Aristotle’s thesis that God knows only himself. In adopting the formula, however, Maimonides interpreted it in the light of human psychology and epistemology, pointing out that, according to Aristotle, the act of human (as well as divine) cognition brings about an identity of the cognizing subject and the cognized object. The parallel drawn by Maimonides between the human and the divine intellect quite evidently implies a certain similarity between the two; in other words, it is incompatible with the negative theology of other passages of the 
<e>Guide</e>
. Nor can it be reconciled with his theological doctrine that the structure of the world—created in time—came into being through the action of God’s will. 
</p>


-<p>
There would be no enigma in the 
<e>Guide</e>
if Maimonides had believed that truth can be discovered in a suprarational way, through revelations vouchsafed to the Prophets. This, however, is not the case. Maimonides held that the Prophets (with the exception of 
<xref topicid="393555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses</xref>
) combine great intellectual ability, which qualifies them to be philosophers, with a powerful imagination. The intellectual faculty of the philosophers and the prophets receives an overflow from the active intellect. In the case of the Prophets, this overflow not only brings about intellectual activity but also passes over into the imaginative faculty, giving rise to visions and dreams. The fact that prophets have a strong imagination gives them no superiority in knowledge over philosophers, who do not have it. Moses, who belonged to a higher category than did the other Prophets, did not have recourse to imagination. 
</p>

<p>The laws and religion as instituted by Moses are intended not only to ensure the bodily welfare and safety of the members of the community but also to facilitate the attainment of intellectual truths by individuals gifted enough to uncover the various hints embodied in religious laws and practices. This does not mean that all the beliefs inculcated by Judaism are true. Some indeed express philosophical truths—though in an inaccurate way, in a language suited to the intellectual capacity of the common people, who in general cannot grasp the import of the dogmas they are required to profess. Other beliefs, however, are false but necessary for the preservation of public order and justice—e.g., the belief that God is angry with wrongdoers.</p>


-<p>
There are two noteworthy aspects of Maimonides’ position on the Law—i.e., the religious commandments. First, he maintained that it is unique in its excellence and valid for all time. This profession of faith, at least with regard to its assumptions about the future, lacked philosophical justification; however, it could be regarded as necessary for the survival of Judaism. Second, he asserted that certain precepts of the 
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mosaic Law</xref>
were related to specific historical situations and to the need to avoid too sharp a break with popular customs and practices—for instance, the commandments concerning sacrifice. 
</p>


-<p>
For at least four or five centuries, 
<e>The Guide for the Perplexed</e>
exercised a very strong influence in the European centres of Jewish thought; in the 13th century, when the 
<e>Guide</e>
was twice translated into Hebrew, these centres were Spain, the south of France, and Italy. Rather paradoxically, in view of the unsystematic character of Maimonides’ exposition, it was used as a standard textbook of philosophy and condemned as such when the teaching of philosophy came under attack. The 
<e>Guide</e>
could be used in this way because from the 13th century onward the history of Jewish philosophy in European countries acquired a continuity it had never had before. This development seems to have resulted from the substitution of Hebrew for Arabic as the language of philosophical exposition. Because of the existence of a common and relatively homogeneous philosophical background—Hebrew texts were much less numerous and less diverse than Arabic philosophical works—and the fact that Jewish philosophers reading and writing in Hebrew read the works of their contemporaries and immediate predecessors, something like a dialogue can be discerned. In striking contrast to the immediately preceding period, European Jewish philosophers in the 13th century and later frequently devoted a very considerable part of their treatises to discussions of the opinions of other Jewish philosophers. That many of the Jewish philosophers in question wrote commentaries on the 
<e>Guide</e>
undoubtedly furthered this tendency.

-<p>
The influence of Maimonides’ great Islamic contemporary 
<xref topicid="45595" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620972">Averroës</xref>
, many of whose commentaries and treatises were translated into Hebrew, was second only to that of Maimonides on Jewish intellectual development. Indeed, it may be argued that for philosophers (as distinct from the general reading public) it often came first. In certain cases, commentators on the 
<e>Guide</e>
quote Averroës’ opinions in order to clarify those of Maimonides, despite the frequent divergences between the two. 
</p>


-<p>
The apparently significant influence of Christian Scholastic thought on Jewish philosophy was often not openly acknowledged by Jewish thinkers in the period beginning with the 13th century. 
<xref topicid="280858" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650196">Samuel ibn Tibbon</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1150–
<e>c.</e>
1230), one of the translators of the 
<e>Guide</e>
into Hebrew and a philosopher in his own right, remarked that the philosophical sciences were more widely known among Christians than among Muslims. Somewhat later, at the end of the 13th century and after, Jewish scholars in Italy translated into Hebrew various texts of 
<xref topicid="31211" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638991">St. Thomas Aquinas</xref>
and other Christian representatives of 
<xref topicid="527973" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620973">Scholasticism</xref>
; not infrequently, some of them acknowledged the debt they owed their Christian masters. In Spain and in the south of France, a different convention seems to have prevailed up to the second half of the 15th century. Whereas Jewish philosophers of these countries felt no reluctance about referring to Greek, Arabic, and other Jewish philosophers, they refrained from citing Christian thinkers whose views had, in all probability, influenced them. In the case of certain Jewish thinkers, this absence of reference to the Christian Scholastics served to disguise the fact that in many essentials they were representative of the philosophical trends, such as 
<xref topicid="331825" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Latin Averroism</xref>
, that were current among the Christian Scholastics of their time. 
</p>


-<p>
There is a striking resemblance between certain views of the Latin Averroists and the parallel opinions of 
<xref topicid="12460" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620974">Isaac Albalag</xref>
, a Jewish philosopher who lived in the second half of the 13th century, probably in Catalonia, Spain, and who wrote a commentary in Hebrew on the 
<e>Tahāfut al-falāsifah </e>
(“The Inconsistencies of the Philosophers”), an exposition of Avicenna’s doctrine written by the Muslim philosopher 
<xref topicid="232533" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620975">al-Ghazālī</xref>
(1058–1111). Albalag’s assertion that both the teachings of the Bible and the truths demonstrated by reason must be believed even if they are contradictory raises the possibility that some historical connections exist between this view and the Latin Averroist doctrine that there are two sets of truths—the religious and the philosophical—which are not necessarily in accord. On most other points Albalag was a follower of the system of Averroës himself. This position is exemplified by Albalag’s rejection of the view that the world was created in time. Although he professed to believe in what he called “absolute creation in time,” this expression merely signifies that at any given moment the continued existence of the world depends on God’s existence, an opinion that is essentially in harmony with Averroës. 
</p>

<p>Joseph Caspi (1297–1340), a prolific philosopher and exegetical commentator, maintained a somewhat unsystematic philosophical position that seems to have been influenced by Averroës. He expressed the opinion that knowledge of the future, including that possessed by God himself, is probabilistic in nature. The prescience of the Prophets is the same. Caspi’s interest in this problem may well have had some connection with the debate about future contingencies in which Christian Scholastics were engaged at that time.</p>


-<p>
Moses of Narbonne, or Moses Narboni, like many other Jewish scholars of the 14th century, wrote mainly commentaries, including those on biblical books, on treatises of Averroës, and on Maimonides’ 
<e>Guide</e>
. In his commentary on the 
<e>Guide</e>
, Narboni often interprets the earlier philosopher’s opinions by recourse to Averroës’ views. Narboni also expounded and gave radical interpretations to certain conceptions that he understood as implied in the 
<e>Guide</e>
. According to Narboni, God participates in all things, because he is the measure of all substances. God’s existence appears to be bound up with that of the world, to which he has a relation analogous to that between a soul and its body (a comparison already made in the 
<e>Guide</e>
).

-<p>
Gersonides, also known as 
<xref topicid="337902" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1620980">Levi ben Gershom</xref>
(1288–1344), wrote the systematic philosophical work 
<e> Sefer milḥamot Adonai </e>
(“The Book of the Wars of the Lord”), as well as many philosophical commentaries. Gersonides cited Greek, Arabic, and Jewish thinkers, and in many ways his system appears to have stemmed from the doctrines of Maimonides or Averroës, regardless of whether he agreed with them. For example, he explicitly rejected Maimonides’ doctrine of negative theology. Although he never explicitly mentioned Christian Scholastic philosophers, a comparison of his opinions and of the particular problems that engaged his attention with the Scholastic writings of his period suggests that he was influenced by the Latins on certain points. 
</p>

<p>Gersonides disagreed both with the Aristotelian philosophers who maintained the eternity of the world and with the religious partisans who believed in the creation of the world in time out of nothing. He argued instead that God created the world in time out of a preexistent body that lacked all form. As Gersonides conceived it, this body seems to be similar to primal matter.</p>

<p>The problem of human freedom of action and a particular version of the problem of God’s knowledge of future contingencies form an important part of Gersonides’ doctrine. Unlike the great Jewish and Muslim Aristotelians, Gersonides believed in astrology and held that all happenings in the world except human actions are governed by a strict determinism. God’s knowledge does not extend to individual human acts but embraces the general order of things; it grasps the laws of universal determinism but is incapable of apprehending events resulting from human freedom. Thus, the object of God’s knowledge is a totally determined world order, which differs from the real world insofar as the latter is in some measure formed according to human freedom.</p>


-<p>
Gersonides does not appear to have assigned to the prophets any political function; according to him, their role consists of predicting future events. The providence exercised by the heavenly bodies ensures the existence in a given political society of people with an aptitude for the handicrafts and professions necessary for the survival of the community. He remarked that in this way the various human activities are distributed in a manner superior to that outlined in the 
<e>Republic</e>
of 
<xref topicid="464109" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638992">Plato</xref>
. Thus, he explicitly rejected Plato’s political philosophy, which, because it was suitable to a society ruled through laws promulgated by a prophet (Muhammad), had been an important element of Jewish philosophy in the Arabic period.

</headtitle>


-<p>
The Spanish Jewish thinker 
<xref topicid="142625" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621001">Ḥasdai ben Abraham Crescas</xref>
(1340–1410), like Gersonides, had thorough knowledge of Jewish philosophy and partial knowledge of Islamic philosophy; in both areas he seems to have been influenced by Christian Scholastic thought. Moreover, in certain important respects Crescas was influenced by Gersonides himself. One of Crescas’s main works, 
<e>Or Adonai</e>
(“The Light of the Lord”), was quite contrary to Gersonides in its attempt to expose the weaknesses of Aristotelian philosophy. This attitude may be placed in the wider context of the return to religion itself, as opposed to the Aristotelian rationalization of religion, and the vogue of 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621002">Kabbala</xref>
(esoteric Jewish mysticism), both of which were characteristic features of Spanish Jewry in Crescas’s time. This change in attitude may have been a reaction to the increasing precariousness of the position of the Jewish community in Spain. 
</p>


-<p>
The criticism of the extreme rationalism of some medieval Aristotelians coincided historically with a certain disintegration of and disaffection toward classical Aristotelian Scholasticism. This trend was associated with the so-called 
<xref topicid="632605" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621004">voluntarism</xref>
of 
<xref topicid="173846" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621005">John Duns Scotus</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1266–1308), the 
<xref topicid="417400" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621006">nominalism</xref>
of 
<xref topicid="424689" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621008">William of Ockham</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1285–1347/49) and other 13th–14th-century Christian Scholastics, and the development of anti-Aristotelian physics at the 
<xref topicid="443814" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">University of Paris</xref>
and elsewhere beginning in the 14th century. Significantly, there is a pronounced resemblance between Crescas’s views and two of these trends, Scotism (the teachings of Duns Scotus and his followers) and the “new” physics. 
</p>


-<p>
Crescas accepted Gersonides’ view that divine attributes cannot be negative, but unlike his predecessor his explanation of the difference between the attributes of God and those of created beings centred on the contrast between an infinite being and finite beings. It is through infinitude that God’s essential attributes—wisdom, for instance—differ from the corresponding and otherwise similar attributes found in created beings. In Crescas’s doctrine, as in that of 
<xref topicid="560202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621010">Spinoza</xref>
, God’s attributes are infinite in number. The central place assigned to the doctrine of God’s infinity in Crescas’s system suggests the influence of Duns Scotus’s theology, which is similarly founded upon the concept of divine infinity. 
</p>


-<p>
The problem of the infinite was approached from an altogether different perspective in Crescas’s critique of Maimonides’ 25 propositions, which Maimonides had set forth in the 
<e>Guide</e>
as the basis of his proof of the existence of God. Crescas’s purpose in criticizing and rejecting several of these propositions was to show that the traditional Aristotelian proofs (founded in the first place on physical doctrines) were not valid. In his critique, Crescas attempted to disprove the Aristotelian thesis that the existence of an actual infinite is impossible. He held that space is not a limit but a three-dimensional extension, that it is infinite, and that, contrary to Aristotle, the existence of a vacuum and of more worlds than one is possible. He also argued that the thesis of the Aristotelian philosophers that there exists an infinite number of causes and effects, which have order and gradation, was impossible. This thesis refers not to a temporal succession of causes and effects that have a similar ontological status but to a vertical series, descending from God to the lowest rung in creation. His attacks were likewise directed against the Aristotelians’ conceptions of time and matter. 
</p>

<p>Crescas’s fundamental opposition to Aristotelianism is perhaps most evident in his rejection of the conception of intellectual activity as the supreme state of being for humans and for God. Crescas’s God is not first and foremost an intellect, and humanity’s supreme goal is not to think but to love God with a love corresponding, as far as possible, to his infinite greatness and to rejoice in the observance of his commandments. God too loves human beings, and his love, in spite of the lowliness of its object, is proportionate to his infinity.</p>

<p>Crescas attacked the Aristotelian teaching of the separation of the intellect from the soul and attempted, perhaps in part under the influence of Judah ha-Levi, to refute the Aristotelian doctrine that the actualized intellect, as distinct from the soul, survives the death of the body. According to Crescas, the soul is a substance in its own right; it can be separated from the body and subsists after the body’s death.</p>

<xref topicid="13063" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Joseph Albo</xref>

-<p>
Whereas Crescas regarded the Aristotelian philosophers as adversaries, 
<xref topicid="13063" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1638993">Joseph Albo</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1380–
<e>c.</e>
1444), who considered Crescas his teacher, expressed a much more ambivalent attitude toward them. Albo did not eschew self-contradiction, apparently considering it a legitimate precaution on the part of a philosophical or theological author; indeed, he indulged in it in a much more obvious way than did Maimonides. But, whereas the latter’s fundamental philosophical position is fairly clear, it is much less apparent who Albo’s true masters were—Crescas and the Jewish religious tradition, or Maimonides and Averroës. Because of this perhaps deliberate failure to explain to the reader where he really stood, Albo has often been dismissed as an eclectic. Indeed, along with the authors just mentioned, Albo was strongly influenced by Saʿadia and seems to have had considerable knowledge of Christian theology, even adopting for his own purposes certain Scholastic doctrines. He differs from Crescas and to some extent resembles Maimonides in having a marked interest in political theory. 
</p>


-<p>
The theme of Albo’s magnum opus, 
<e>Sefer ha-ʿiqqarim </e>
(“Book of Principles”), is the investigation of the theory of Jewish religious dogmas. Maimonides, in a nonphilosophical work, set the number of dogmas at 13, whereas Albo, following a doctrine that seems to go back to Averroës, limited the number to three: the existence of God, divine providence in reward and punishment, and the Torah as divine revelation. One section, usually including the philosophical and the traditional religious interpretations side by side, is devoted to each of these dogmas. Albo’s principal and relatively novel contribution to the evolution of Jewish doctrine is the classification, in his introduction, of natural, conventional, and divine law. 
</p>


-<p>

<xref topicid="406283" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Natural law</xref>
(the universal moral law inherent in 
<xref topicid="275811" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human nature</xref>
) is necessary because human beings, who are political by nature, must belong to a community, which may be restricted in size to one town or may extend over the whole earth. Natural law preserves society by promoting right and repressing injustice; thus, it restrains humans from stealing, robbing, and murdering. The positive laws instituted by the wise take into account the particular nature of the people for whose benefit they are instituted, as well as other circumstances. This means that they differ from the natural law in not being universally applicable. Neither natural law nor the more elaborate conventional laws, however, lead humans toward true spiritual happiness; this is the function of divine laws instituted by a prophet, which teach humans true theoretical opinions. Whereas Maimonides maintained that Judaism was the only divine law promulgated by a true prophet, Albo considered that the commandments given to 
<xref topicid="416799" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621016">Noah</xref>
for all humankind—the 
<xref topicid="416814" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1758491">Noahide Laws</xref>
that Noah received after the Flood—also constitute divine law, which ensures, though to a lesser degree than does Judaism, the happiness of its adherents. This position justifies a certain universalism; in accordance with a Talmudic saying, Albo believed that the pious among the non-Jews—that is, those who observe Noah’s laws—have a share in the world to come. But he rejected the pretensions of Christianity and Islam to encompass divine laws comparable—or even superior—to Judaism.

-<p>
The expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and 1497, respectively, produced a new centre of Jewish thought: Holland, where many exiled Jews found a new and safer domicile; the tolerance of the regime seemed to provide guarantees against external persecution. This did not prevent, and indeed may have furthered, the establishment of an oppressive internal orthodoxy that was prepared to chastise rebellious members of the community. This was evident in the cases of

Belonging to a family of 
<xref topicid="366145" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621041">Marranos</xref>
in Portugal, Acosta arrived in Amsterdam after having been brought up in the Catholic faith. His philosophical position was to a great extent determined by his antagonism to the dogmatism of the traditional Judaism that he encountered in Amsterdam. His growing estrangement from generally accepted Jewish doctrine is attested by his Portuguese treatise 
<e>Sobre a mortalidade da alma </e>
(“On the Mortality of the Soul”). He held that the belief in the immortality of the soul has many evil effects and that it impels people to choose an ascetic way of life and even to seek death. According to him, nothing has tormented human beings more than the belief in an inner, spiritual good and evil. At this stage, Acosta affirmed the authority of the Bible, from which, according to him, the mortality of the soul can be proved. 
</p>


-<p>
In his autobiography, 
<e>Exemplar Humanae Vitae </e>
(“Example of a Human Life”), Acosta took a more radical position. He proclaimed the supreme excellence of the natural moral law; when arguing before Jews, he seemed to identify this law with the 
<xref topicid="416814" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Noahide Laws</xref>
(the commandments given to Noah), thus suggesting a correspondence with the view of Albo. Accordingly, Acosta denied the validity of the argument that natural law is inferior to Judaism and Christianity, because he believed that both these religions teach the love of one’s enemies, a precept that is not a part of natural law and is a manifest impossibility.

<xref topicid="560202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Benedict de Spinoza</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
Born in Amsterdam but of Portuguese Marrano descent, Spinoza is unique in the history of modern Jewish thought. Although his work does not deal with specifically Judaic themes, he is traditionally included in this history for several reasons. First, it was through the study of Jewish philosophical texts that Spinoza was first initiated into philosophy. Second, Spinoza’s system is in part a radicalization of, or perhaps a logical corollary to, medieval Jewish doctrines, and the impact of Maimonides and of Crescas is evident. Third, a considerable portion of Spinoza’s 
<e>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</e>
deals with problems related to Judaism. He drew from Jewish religion and history, even using the Israelite commonwealth in the 
<e>Tractatus</e>
as the template for his ideal state, though he was not centrally concerned with matters of Jewish theology and ritual. 
</p>


-<p>
The first chapters of the 
<e>Tractatus</e>
show that the doctrine of prophecy is of central importance to Spinoza’s explanation of Judaism and that, in dealing with this subject, he used Maimonides’ categories, though he applied them to different people or groups of people. Maimonides held that the prophets combined intellectual perfection, which made them philosophers, with perfection of the imaginative faculty. He also referred to a category of persons, including lawyers and statesmen, endowed with a strong imagination but possessing no extraordinary intellectual gifts. Spinoza applied this category to the prophets, whom he described as possessing vivid imaginations but as not necessarily having outstanding intellectual capacities. He denied that the biblical Prophets were philosophers and used a philosophical and historical approach to the Scriptures to show that the contrary assertion is not borne out by the texts. 
</p>

<p>Spinoza also denied Maimonides’ assertion that the prophecy of Moses was essentially different from that of the other Prophets and that this was because Moses, in prophesying, had no recourse to the imaginative faculty. According to Spinoza, Moses’ prophecy was unique because he heard the voice of God in a prophetic vision—that is, in a state in which his imagination was active. In this assertion, Spinoza employed one of Maimonides’ categories of prophecy. Maimonides thought it improbable, however, that the voice of God was ever heard in prophetic vision, and he held that this category is purely hypothetical. In his classification of Moses, Spinoza was not concerned with what really happened in history; rather, he was attempting to fashion the biblical evidence according to Maimonides’ theoretical framework so that it would further his own theological and political purpose: to show that there could be a religion superior to Judaism.</p>


-<p>
This purpose made it imperative to propound in the 
<e>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</e>
a theory concerning 
<xref topicid="303091" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jesus</xref>
, whom Spinoza designates as Christus. The category and the status assigned to Jesus are similar to those that 
<xref topicid="358539" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Maimonides</xref>
attributed to Moses. Jesus is referred to in the 
<e>Tractatus</e>
as a religious teacher who makes recourse not to the imaginative faculty but to the intellect. His authority may be used to institute and strengthen the religion Spinoza called 
<e>religio catholica</e>
(“universal religion”), which has little or nothing in common with any of the major manifestations of historic Christianity. 
</p>


-<p>
The difference between Judaism and Spinoza’s 
<e>religio catholica</e>
corresponds to the difference between Moses and Jesus. After leaving Egypt, the Jews found themselves, in Spinoza’s view, in the position of people who had no allegiance to any positive law. They had, as it were, reverted to a state of nature and were faced with the need to enter into a social pact. They were also an ignorant people and very prone to superstition. Moses, a man of outstanding ability, made use of the situation and the characteristics of the people in order to make them accept a social pact and a state founded upon it that, contrary to Spinoza’s scheme for his ideal communities, were not based first and foremost upon utilitarian—that is, reasonable—consideration of the advantages of life in society over the state of nature. 
</p>


-<p>
According to Spinoza, the social pact concluded by the children of Israel in the desert was based upon a superstitious view of God as “King” and “Judge,” to whom the children of Israel owed their political and military successes. The children of Israel transferred political sovereignty to God rather than to the representatives of the popular will. In due course, political sovereignty was vested in Moses, God’s representative, and in his successors. In spite of Spinoza’s insistence on the superstitious foundations of the ancient Israelite state, however, his account of its regime was not wholly unsympathetic, especially regarding its ability to curb human tyranny by its doctrine of divine sovereignty. Spinoza believed that the state contained the seeds of its own destruction and that, with its extinction, the social pact devised by 
<xref topicid="393555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses</xref>
had lapsed and all the political and religious obligations incumbent upon the Jews had become null and void. 
</p>


-<p>
It could be argued that, because the state conceived by Spinoza is based not on superstitious faith but on a 
<xref topicid="550994" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">social contract</xref>
originating in rational, utilitarian considerations, it does not need to have its authority safeguarded and stabilized by means of religion. Nevertheless, Spinoza apparently believed that religion is necessary. To fulfill this need and to obviate the danger of harmful religions, he devised the 
<e>religio catholica</e>
, the universal religion, which is characterized by two distinctive traits. First, its main purpose, a practical one (which is furthered by recourse to the authority of Jesus), is to impel people to act in accordance with justice and charity. Such conduct is tantamount to obedience to the laws of the state and to the orders of the magistrates, in whom sovereignty is vested. Disobedience, however, even if it springs from compassionate motives, weakens the social pact, which safeguards the welfare of all the members of the community; in consequence, its evil effects outweigh whatever good it may produce. Second, although religion, according to Spinoza, is not concerned with theoretical truth, in order to be effective the 
<e>religio catholica</e>
requires dogmas, which he set forth in the 
<e>Tractatus</e>
. These dogmas are formulated in terms that can be interpreted in accordance both with the philosophical conception of God that Spinoza regarded as true and with widespread superstitious ideas. It follows that if they are accepted as constituting the only creed that everybody is obliged to profess, people cannot be persecuted on account of their beliefs. Spinoza held that such persecution may lead to civil war and may thus destroy the state. Philosophers are free to engage in the pursuit of truth and to attain, if they can, the supreme goal of humanity—freedom grounded in knowledge. There can be little doubt that the furtherance of the cause of tolerance for philosophical opinions was one of Spinoza’s main objects in writing the 
<e>Tractatus</e>
. 
</p>


-<p>
As compared with the 
<e>Tractatus Theologico-Philosophicus</e>
, the 
<e>Ethics</e>
, Spinoza’s major philosophical work, bears a much more ambiguous relation to Jewish medieval philosophy. In a way, Spinoza’s metaphysical system, contained in the 
<e>Ethics</e>
, can be regarded as drawing aspects of medieval Aristotelianism to their logical conclusions, a step that most Jewish (and Christian and Muslim) thinkers were unwilling to take, owing to their theological conservatism.

-<p>
The era opened by 
<xref topicid="374802" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621072">Moses Mendelssohn</xref>
(1729–86)—i.e., 
<e>c.</e>
1750 to 
<e>c.</e>
1830—is sometimes called the German period of Jewish philosophy because of the large number of works on Jewish philosophy that were written in German. The German period is also marked by the emancipation of the Jews—that is, by the abrogation of discriminatory laws directed against them—and by their partial or complete assimilation. In this time in particular, the term 
<e>Jewish philosophy</e>
applied especially to works that were primarily concerned with defining Judaism and offering a justification of its existence. The second of these tasks was often conceived of as involving a confrontation with Christianity rather than with philosophy. This change from what would have been the practice in the Middle Ages seems to have resulted from the demarcation of the sphere of religion in such a way that, at least in the opinion of the philosophers, possible points of collision with philosophy no longer existed. This development was stimulated by the doctrine of Spinoza, from whom Mendelssohn and others took certain fundamental ideas concerning Judaism. 
</p>


-<p>
Like Spinoza, Mendelssohn held that it is not the task of Judaism to teach rational truths, though such truths may be referred to in the Bible. Contrary to what he called Athanasian Christianity—that is, the doctrine set forth in the 
<xref topicid="40585" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621073">Athanasian Creed</xref>
—Judaism has no binding dogmas; it is centred on inculcating belief in certain historical events and on the observance of religious law, which includes the ceremonial commandments. Such observance is supposed to lead to happiness in this world and in the afterlife. Mendelssohn did not reject this view out of hand, as Spinoza would have done. Indeed, he seems to have been prepared to accept it, God’s mysteries being inscrutable, and the radicalism and what may be called the consistency of Spinoza being the complete antithesis of Mendelssohn’s apologetics. Non-Jews were supposed by Mendelssohn to owe allegiance to the natural moral law.

Whereas Mendelssohn continued the medieval tradition (at least to some extent) or adapted Spinoza’s doctrine for his own purposes, the Jewish philosophers of the first half of the 19th century generally followed the teachings of the non-Jewish philosophers of their own time. In 
<e>Die Religion des Geistes </e>
(“The Religion of the Spirit”), 
<xref topicid="213898" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621074">Solomon Formstecher</xref>
(1808–89) may have been influenced by 
<xref topicid="527203" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621075">F.W.J. von Schelling</xref>
(1775–1854) in his conception of nature and spirit as manifestations of the divine. In Formstecher’s view, there are two types of religions that correspond to these manifestations: the religion of nature, in which God is conceived as the principle of nature or as the world soul, and the religion of the spirit, in which God is understood as an ethical being. According to the religion of the spirit, God has produced the world as his manifestation in full freedom and not, as the religion of nature tends to profess, because the world was necessary for his existence. 
</p>

<p>The religion of the spirit, which corresponds to absolute religious truth, was first manifested in the Jewish people. The religious history of the world may be understood as a process of universalization of the Jewish religion, according to Formstecher. Thus, Christianity propagated Jewish conceptions among the nations; however, it combined them with pagan ideas. The pagan element is gradually being eliminated—Protestantism, in this respect, marks considerable progress. When at long last the Jewish element in Christianity is victorious, the Jews will be right to give up their isolation. The progress that will bring about this final religious union is already under way.</p>

The main philosophical work of 
<xref topicid="266854" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621076">Samuel Hirsch</xref>
(1815–89), titled 
<e>Die Religionsphilosophie der Juden </e>
(“The Philosophy of Religion of the Jews”), was decisively influenced by 
<xref topicid="259378" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621077">G.W.F. Hegel</xref>
(1770–1831). Hegel’s impact is most evident in Hirsch’s method and in the task that he assigned to the 
<xref topicid="497132" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">philosophy of religion</xref>
—the transformation of religious consciousness into conceptual truth. Contrary to Hegel, however, he did not consider religious truth to be inadequate compared with philosophical truth. 
</p>


-<p>
In Hirsch’s view, God revealed himself in the first stages of Jewish history by means of miracles and prophecy. At present, he manifests himself in the miracle of the existence of the Jewish people. Hirsch further maintained that Christianity and Judaism were identical at the time of Jesus and that a decisive break between them was caused by 
<xref topicid="447019" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Paul</xref>
. When the Pauline elements are eliminated from Christianity, it will be essentially in agreement with Judaism, though Judaism will preserve its separate existence.

<xref topicid="323709" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621078">Nachman Krochmal</xref>

and on Jewish history. Krochmal’s philosophical thought was based on the notion of spirit. He was mainly concerned with the “national spirit” that is proper to each people and that accounts for the characteristics differentiating one people from another in every domain of human activity. The national spirits of all peoples except the Jewish are, according to Krochmal, essentially particular. Hence, when the nation becomes extinct, the national spirit either disappears or, if it is powerful, is assimilated by some other nation. The perpetuity of the Jewish people, according to Krochmal, is the result of their special relation to the Universal Spirit, who is the God of Israel.

-<p>
Solomon Ludwig Steinheim (1789–1866), the author of 
<e>Die Offenbarung nach dem Lehrbegriff der Synagoge </e>
(“The Revelation According to the Doctrine of the Synagogue”), was apparently influenced by the antirationalism of the German philosopher 
<xref topicid="298993" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621079">Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</xref>
(1743–1819). His criticism of science is based on Jacobi’s work, though he did not agree with Jacobi in opposing discursive reason to the 
<xref topicid="292162" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">intuitive knowledge</xref>
of God; Steinheim contrasted human reason with divine revelation. The main point of opposition between revelation, vouchsafed to the prophets of Israel, and reason is that the God posited by reason is subject to necessity—he can act only in accordance with laws. Moreover, reason affirms that nothing can come from nothing. Accordingly, God is free to create not a good world but only the best possible world. Revealed religion, on the other hand, affirms the freedom of God and the creation of the world out of nothing.

</headtitle>


-<p>
There seems to be little connection between the Jewish philosophers of the first half or two-thirds of the 19th century and 
<xref topicid="124534" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621080">Hermann Cohen</xref>
(1842–1918), the head of the 
<xref topicid="408668" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Neo-Kantian</xref>
school centred at the University of Marburg. Cohen may be regarded as a rather unusual case among the Jewish philosophers of his and the preceding generations because of the dual nature of his philosophical thought—the general and the Jewish—and the uneasy equilibrium between them. Judaism was by no means the only important theme of his philosophical system; indeed, it was not even his point of departure. For most of his life, Cohen was wholly committed to his brand of 
<xref topicid="311522" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621081">Kantianism</xref>
, and he displayed considerable originality in its elaboration. It has been maintained with some justification that his doctrine manifests a certain (unintentional) kinship with Hegel’s, though Cohen’s idea of God is based on an analysis and development of certain conceptions of 
<xref topicid="311398" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621082">Immanuel Kant</xref>
. In Cohen’s view, reason requires that nature be conceived of as conforming to a single rational plan and that there be harmony between the domains of natural and moral teleology (ultimate purposes or ends). These two requirements in turn require the adoption of the idea of God—the word 
<e>idea</e>
being used in the Kantian sense, which means that no assertion is made about the metaphysical reality of God. 
</p>


-<p>
Cohen’s later works increasingly emphasized generally religious and specifically Judaic elements. Some scholars, most notably his student 
<xref topicid="509953" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Franz Rosenzweig</xref>
, interpreted this as a major turn in Cohen’s thought. In the late 20th century, however, most scholars held that the more-pronounced Judaism in Cohen’s later works was the culmination of his overall philosophical system, not a radical departure from it.

-<p>

<xref topicid="509953" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621083">Franz Rosenzweig</xref>
(1886–1929) published his main philosophical work, 
<e>Der Stern der Erlösung </e>
(
<e>The Star of Redemption</e>
), in 1921. It begins by rejecting the traditional philosophical denial of the fear of death, maintaining instead that this fear is the beginning of the cognition of the All. Humans should fear death, despite the indifference of philosophy and its predilection for accepting death. Traditional philosophy is interested exclusively in the universal, and it is monistic—its aim is to discover one principle from which everything can be derived. This tendency of philosophy, however, denatures human experience, which knows not one but three separate domains (which Kant had referred to in a different context), namely, God, the world, and humanity. 
</p>


-<p>
According to Rosenzweig, God (like the world and like humankind) is known through experience (the experience of revelation). In 
<xref topicid="244768" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Greek religion</xref>
, the most perfect manifestation of paganism, every one of these domains subsists by itself: the gods, the cosmos, and the human as the tragic, solitary, silent hero. Biblical religion is concerned with the relation between the three: the relation between God and the world, which is creation; the relation between God and human beings, which is revelation; and the relation between humans and the world, which leads to salvation. Under the influence of Schelling, whose term and concept he adopted, Rosenzweig pursued a “narrative philosophy” that renounces the ambition to find one principle for everything that exists and that follows biblical religion in focusing on the connections between the three domains and between the words and acts that bring about and develop these connections. 
</p>

<p>Biblical faith brought forth two valid religions—Christianity and Judaism. The first is described by Rosenzweig as the eternal way; the Christian peoples seek in the vicissitudes of time and history the way to salvation. In contrast to them, the existence of the stateless Jewish people is not concerned with time and history; it is—notwithstanding the hope for final salvation—already an eternal life, renewed again and again according to the rhythm of the Jewish liturgical year.</p>

Among the leading thinkers of the 20th century was 
<xref topicid="82688" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621084">Martin Buber</xref>
(1878–1965), whose impact was felt by both Jews and non-Jews. In his early period, Buber was led, partly through empathy with Jewish and non-Jewish mysticism, to stress unitive experience and knowledge, in which the difference between one person and another and between the individual and God tend to disappear. But in his final period he taught—following, as he claimed, a suggestion of 
<xref topicid="205641" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621086">Ludwig Feuerbach</xref>
(1804–72)—that a human being can realize himself only in a relation with another, who may be another person or God. This conception of the “I and Thou” relationship led to the formulation of Buber’s view of the dialogical life—the mutual, responsive relation between one person and another—and accounts for the importance that he attached to the category of “encounter.”

<headtitle>Nature and characteristics</headtitle>


-<p>
The term 

-<xref topicid="400861" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650345">

<e>mysticism</e>

</xref>
applies to the attempt to establish direct contact, independently of 
<xref topicid="534691" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sense perception</xref>
and intellectual apprehension, with the divine—a reality beyond rational understanding and believed to be the ultimate ground of being. Since mysticism springs from an aspiration to join and grasp that which falls outside ordinary experience, it is not easily defined. There is no clear boundary line between mysticism and 
<xref topicid="377923" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639101">metaphysics</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="139301" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639102">cosmology</xref>
, 
<xref topicid="591137" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639103">theosophy</xref>
(a system of thought claiming special insights or revelation into the divine nature), 
<xref topicid="424235" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639104">occultism</xref>
, theurgy (the art of compelling or persuading divine powers), or even magic. 
</p>


-<h4 tocid="35320">

<headtitle>The Judaic context</headtitle>


-<p>
As the search for direct contact with the divine, however, mysticism seems to be in conflict with classical Judaism. Normative Judaism consists of a faith in a 
<xref topicid="390101" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sole God</xref>
who created the universe and who chose to reveal himself to a select group by means of a rule of life he imposed on it—
<xref topicid="599756" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Torah</xref>
. According to traditional Judaic beliefs, the earthly destiny of the chosen nation, as well as the eternal salvation of the individual, depends on the observance of this rule of life, through which any relationship to God must take place. The fact is, however, that in the religious history of Judaism the quest for God goes beyond the relationship mediated by Torah without ever dispensing with it (since that would take the seeker outside Judaism), without pretending to reach the depths of the mystery of the divine, and without ending in an ontological identification with God (i.e., in the belief that God and 
<xref topicid="275376" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">human beings</xref>
are the same in nature and being). 
</p>

<p>It must also be noted that the quest for God implies the search for solutions to problems that go beyond those of religion in the narrow sense and that arise even when there is no interest in the relationship between humankind and supernatural powers. Humans ponder the problems of their origins, their destiny, their happiness, their suffering; the presence or absence of religious institutions or dogmas is of little importance when it comes to these questions. They were all formulated within nonmystical Judaism and served as the basis and framework for the setting and solution of problems in the various forms of Jewish mysticism. This mysticism brought about profound transformations in the concepts of the world, God, and “last things” (resurrection, last judgment, messianic kingdom, etc.) set forth in biblical and rabbinical Judaism. Nevertheless, Jewish mysticism’s own set of problems—about the origins of the universe, humankind, evil, and sin; about the meaning of history; and about the afterlife and the end of time—is rooted in the very ground of Judaism and cannot be conceived outside an exegesis of revealed Scripture and rabbinical tradition.</p>

-<h4 tocid="35321">

<headtitle>Three types of Jewish mysticism</headtitle>

<p>There are three types of mysticism in the history of Judaism: the ecstatic, the contemplative, and the esoteric. Although they are distinct, they frequently overlap in practice.</p>


-<p>
The first type is characterized by the quest for God—or, more precisely, for access to a supernatural realm, which is itself infinitely remote from the inaccessible Deity—by means of ecstatic experiences. The second type is rooted in metaphysical 
<xref topicid="372609" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">meditation</xref>
, which always bears the imprint of the cultural surroundings of the respective thinkers, who are exposed to influences from outside Judaism. 
<xref topicid="456612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Philo Judaeus of Alexandria</xref>
and a few of the Jewish thinkers of the Middle Ages, who drew their inspiration from Greco-Arabic 
<xref topicid="409036" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Neoplatonism</xref>
and sometimes also from Muslim mysticism, are examples of those who felt external influences. 
</p>


-<p>
The third type of mysticism claims an esoteric knowledge (hereafter called esoterism) that explores the divine life itself and its relationship to the extra-divine level of being (i.e., the natural, finite realm), a relationship that is subject to the “law of correspondences.” From this perspective, the extra-divine is a symbol of the divine; it is a reality that reveals a reality superior to itself. This form of mysticism, akin to gnosis (the secret knowledge claimed by 
<xref topicid="236343" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621099">gnosticism</xref>
, a Hellenistic religious and philosophical movement) but purged—or almost purged—of the dualism that characterizes the latter, is what is commonly known as 
<xref topicid="309224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621100">Kabbala</xref>
(Hebrew: “Tradition”). By extension, this term is also used to designate technical methods, used for highly diverse ends, ranging from the conditioning of the aspirant to ecstatic experiences to magical manipulations of a superstitious character. 
</p>

<headtitle>Main lines of development</headtitle>


-<p>
From the beginning of Jewish mysticism in the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
to the middle of the 12th century, only the ecstatic and contemplative types existed. It was not until the second half of the 12th century that esoterism became clearly discernible; from then on, Jewish mysticism developed in various forms up to very recent times. 
</p>


-<h4 tocid="35323">


-<headtitle>
Early stages to the 6th century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>

</headtitle>


-<p>
The centuries following the return from the 
<xref topicid="47693" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonian Exile</xref>
were marked by increasingly widespread and intense reflection on various themes: the intermediary beings between humans and God; the divine appearances, whose special place of occurrence had formerly been the most sacred part of the Jerusalem Temple; the creation of human beings; and the creation and organization of the universe. None of these themes was absent from the Bible, which was held to be divinely revealed, but each had become the object of constant theological readjustment that also involved the adoption of concepts from outside and reactions against them. The speculative taste of Jewish thinkers between the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
and the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
took them in many different directions: angelology (doctrine about angels) and demonology (doctrine about devils); mythical geography and uranography (description of the heavens); contemplation of the 
<xref topicid="590940" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">divine manifestations</xref>
, whose background was the Jerusalem Temple worship and the visions of the moving “throne” (
<e>merkava</e>
, “chariot”) in the prophecy of Ezekiel; reflection on the double origin of human beings, who are formed of the earth but are also the “image of God”; and speculation on the end of time (
<xref topicid="192308" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621120">eschatology</xref>
), on resurrection (a concept that appeared only toward the end of the biblical period), and on rewards and punishments in the afterlife. 
</p>


-<p>
This ferment was crystallized in writings such as the 
<xref topicid="188588" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">First Book of Enoch</xref>
. Almost none of it was retained in 
<xref topicid="455129" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Pharisaic</xref>
(rabbinical) Judaism, which became the normative Jewish tradition after the Roman conquest of 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jerusalem</xref>
and the destruction of the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Second Temple</xref>
. The 
<xref topicid="581644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Talmud</xref>
and the 
<xref topicid="381628" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Midrash</xref>
(rabbinical legal and interpretative literature) touched these themes only with great reserve, often unwillingly, and more often in a spirit of negative polemic. 
</p>


-<p>
As early as the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
and probably even before the destruction of the Second Temple, there were sages or teachers recognized by the religious community for whom 
<xref topicid="372609" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">meditation</xref>
on the Scriptures—especially the creation narrative, the public revelation of the Torah on 
<xref topicid="545577" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mount Sinai</xref>
, the 
<xref topicid="376144" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Merkava</xref>
vision of Ezekiel, and the Song of Solomon—and reflection on the end of time, resurrection, and the afterlife were not only a matter of the exegesis of texts recognized to be of divine origin but also a matter of inner experience. However, speculation on the invisible world and the search for the means to penetrate it were probably carried on in other circles. It is undeniable that there was a certain continuity between the apocalyptic visions (i.e., of the cataclysmic advent of God’s kingdom) and documents of certain 
<xref topicid="193097" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sects</xref>
(
<xref topicid="154274" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621121">Dead Sea Scrolls</xref>
) and the writings, preserved in Hebrew, of the “explorers of the supernatural world” (
<e>yorde merkava</e>
). The latter comprise ecstatic hymns, descriptions of the “dwellings” (
<e>hekhalot</e>
) located between the visible world and the ever-inaccessible Divinity, whose transcendence is paradoxically expressed by anthropomorphic descriptions consisting of inordinate hyperboles (
<e>Shiʿur qoma</e>
, “Divine Dimensions”). A few documents have been preserved that attest to the initiation of carefully chosen persons who were made to undergo tests and ordeals in accordance with psychosomatic criteria borrowed from physiognomy (the art of determining character from physical, especially facial, traits). Some theurgic efficacy was attributed to these practices, and there was some contamination from Egyptian, Hellenistic, or Mesopotamian magic. (A curious document in this respect, rich in pagan material, is the 
<e>Sefer ha-razim</e>
, the “Treatise on Mysteries,” which was discovered in 1963.) 
</p>


-<p>
The similarities between concepts reflected in unquestionably Jewish texts and those expressed in documents of contemporary non-Jewish esoterism are so numerous that it becomes difficult, sometimes impossible, to distinguish the giver from the receiver. Two facts are certain, however. On the one hand, gnosticism never ceases to exploit biblical themes that have passed through Judaism (such as the tale of creation and the speculation on angels and demons), whatever their original source may have been; on the other hand, though Jewish esoterism may borrow this or that motif from ancient gnosis or syncretism and may even raise a supernatural entity such as the angel 
<xref topicid="378043" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Metatron</xref>
—also known as “little Adonai” (i.e., little Lord or God)—to a very high rank in the hierarchy of being, it still remains inflexibly monotheistic and rejects the gnostic concept of a bad or simply inferior demiurge who is responsible for the creation and governing of the visible world. Finally, during the centuries that separate the Talmudic period (2nd–5th centuries 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
) from the full resurgence of Jewish esoterism in the middle of the 12th century, the texts that were preserved progressively lose their density and affective authenticity and become reduced to the level of literary exercises that are more grandiloquent than substantial.

<xref topicid="532602" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sefer yetzira</xref>

</e>

</headtitle>


-<p>
In the ancient esoteric literature of Judaism, a special place must be given to the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
(“Book of 
<xref topicid="142144" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Creation</xref>
”), which deals with cosmogony and cosmology. Creation, it affirms with a clearly anti-gnostic insistence, is the work of the God of Israel and took place on the ideal, immaterial level and on the concrete level. This was done according to a complex process that brings in the 10 numbers (
<e>sefirot</e>
, singular 

-<e>

<xref topicid="532613" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sefira</xref>

</e>
) of decimal notation and the 22 letters of the 
<xref topicid="259061" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew</xref>
alphabet. The 10 numbers are not understood merely as arithmetical symbols: they are cosmological factors—the first of which, signified by the multiply ambiguous term 
<e>ruaḥ</e>
, is the spirit of God, while the nine others seem to be the archetypes of the three elements (air, water, fire) and the spatial dimensions (up, down, and the four cardinal points). After having been manipulated either in their graphic representation or in combination, the letters of the alphabet, which are considered transcriptions of the sounds of the language, are in turn instruments of creation. The basic idea of all this speculation is that speech (that is, language composed of words, which are in turn composed of letters or sounds) is not only a means of communication but an operational agent destined to produce being; it has an ontological value. This value, however, does not extend to every language; it belongs to the 
<xref topicid="259061" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew language</xref>
alone. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
does not proceed entirely from biblical data and rabbinical reflection upon them; Greek influences are discernible, even in the vocabulary. What is important, however, is its influence on later Jewish thought, down to the present time: philosophers and esoterists have vied with one another over its meaning, pulling it in their own direction and adjusting it to their respective ideologies. Even more important is the fact that Kabbala borrowed a great deal of its terminology from the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
(e.g., 

-<e>

<xref topicid="532613" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sefira</xref>

</e>
), making semantic adaptations as required. 
</p>


-<p>
The speculation traced above developed during the first six centuries of the Common Era, both in Palestine and in Babylonia. Babylonian Judaism had its own social and ideological characteristics, which put it in opposition to Palestinian Judaism with regard to esoterism and other manifestations of the life of the spirit. The joint doctrinal influence of the two centres spread from the mid-8th to the 11th century among the Jews of 
<xref topicid="418538" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North Africa</xref>
and Europe; mystical doctrines also filtered in, but very little is known about the circumstances and means of their penetration.

influence (7th–13th century) 
</headtitle>


-<p>
Arabic Islamic culture was another important influence on Jewish mystical development. A considerable part of Jewry, which had fallen under Muslim domination in the 7th and 8th centuries, participated in the new Arabic-Islamic civilization; the Jews of Asia, Africa, and Spain soon adopted Arabic, the language of culture and communication. Arabic-language culture introduced elements of Greek philosophy and Islamic mysticism into Judaism and contributed to the deepening of certain theological concepts that were of Jewish origin but had become the common property of the three religions of the Book: affirming the divine unity, purging anthropomorphism from the idea of God, and following a spiritual path to the divine that leads through an ascetic discipline (both physical and intellectual) to a detachment from this world and a freeing of the soul from all that distracts it from God. Greek philosophy and Islamic mysticism moreover raised serious questions that threatened traditional beliefs about the creation of the world, the providential action of God, miracles, and eschatology. Even in the 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christian</xref>
West, where cultural contacts between the majority society and the Jewish minority were far from reaching the breadth and intensity of Judeo-Arab relations, Jewish intellectuals were unable to remain impervious to the incursions of the surrounding civilization. (Jewish biblical scholars were at times sought out by Christian theologians for help in understanding the Hebrew Scriptures.) Moreover, at the beginning of the 12th century if not earlier, European Judaism received part of the intellectual Arabic and Judeo-Arab heritage through translations or adaptations into Hebrew, its only cultural language.

1150–1250) 
</headtitle>

<p>Under these circumstances, starting around 1150, manifestations of markedly theosophic ideologies appeared in southern France (in the regions of Provence and Languedoc). The two types that can be distinguished at the outset are very different in appearance, form, and content.</p>

-<xref topicid="532521" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">

<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>

</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
The first type is represented in fragmentary, poorly written, and badly assembled texts that began to circulate in Provence and Languedoc during the third quarter of the 12th century. Their inspiration, however, leaves no doubt as to the community of their origin. They were in the form of a Midrash—that is, an interpretation of Scripture with the help of a particular interpretative method, full of sayings attributed to ancient rabbinical authorities. This body of texts, probably imported from the 
<xref topicid="381192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle East</xref>
(Syria, Palestine, Iraq), is known as the “Midrash of Rabbi Nehunya ben Haqana” (from the name of a 1st-century rabbi) or 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
(“Book of Brightness,” from a characteristic word of the first verse of Scripture to be elucidated in the work). The authorities cited are all inauthentic (as was often the case in late works). The content of this Midrash may be characterized as a form of gnosticism that successfully tries to escape any ontological dualism. 
</p>


-<p>
The object of the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
is to present the origin of things and the course of history centred on the chosen people, with vicissitudes caused in turn by obedience to God and by sin, as conditioned by the manifestation of divine powers. These “powers” are not “attributes” derived and defined by philosophical abstraction, though that is one of the terms used to designate them: they are hypostases (essences or substances). They are inseparable from God, but each one is clothed in its own personality, each operates in its own manner, leaning toward severity or mercy, in dynamic correspondence with the behaviour of human beings, especially of Jews, in the visible world. They are ranked in a hierarchy, which is not as fixed as it would become starting with the second generation of Kabbalists in Languedoc and Catalonia. The rich nomenclature used to designate the “powers” exploits the resources of both the Bible and the rabbinical tradition, of the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
, of some ritual observances, and also of the letters of the 
<xref topicid="259035" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew alphabet</xref>
and the signs that can be added to them to indicate the vowels. 
</p>


-<p>
Thus, according to the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
, the universe is the manifestation of hierarchically organized divine powers, and the power that is at the bottom of the hierarchy has special charge of the visible world. This entity is highly complex. Undoubtedly there are survivals of gnostic speculation on Sophia (“Wisdom”), who is involved, sometimes to her misfortune, in the material world. This power is also the divine “Presence” (Shekhina) of rabbinical theology, though it is profoundly transformed: it has become a hypostasis. By a bold innovation, it is characterized as a feminine being and thus finds itself, while remaining an aspect of the Divinity, in the position of a daughter or a wife, who owns nothing herself and receives all from the father or the husband. It is also identified with the “Community of Israel,” another radical innovation that was facilitated by ancient speculation based on the allegorical interpretation of the 
<xref topicid="553534" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621142">Song of Solomon</xref>
, which represents the relationship of God to the chosen nation in terms of the marriage bond. Thus, a theosophical equality is established between the whole of the people chosen by God, constituted into a kind of mystical body, and an aspect of the Divinity—whence the solidarity and linked destiny of the two. A comparable relationship between the “Presence” and Israel was not totally foreign to ancient rabbinical theology. In this light, the obedience or disobedience of Israel to its particular vocation is a determining factor of cosmic harmony or disruption and extends to the inner life of the Divinity. This is the essential and definitive contribution of the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
to Jewish theosophy. The same document evinces the resurgence of a notion that older theologians had attempted to combat—that of 
<e>metensōmatōsis</e>
, the reincarnation into several successive bodies of a soul that has not attained the required perfection in a previous existence.

<headtitle>School of Isaac the Blind</headtitle>


-<p>
Another theosophic tendency in Languedoc developed concurrently with—but independently of—the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
. The two movements would take only about 30 years to converge, constituting what may conveniently (though not quite precisely) be called classical Kabbala. The second school flourished in Languedoc during the last quarter of the 12th century and crossed the Pyrenees into Spain in the first years of the 13th century. 
</p>


-<p>
The most eminent spokesman of this school was Isaac ben Abraham, known as Isaac the Blind, whose extant works include a very obscure commentary on the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
. In the view of the eminent Kabbala scholar Gershom G. Scholem (1897–1982), Isaac’s general vision of the universe proceeds from the link he discovers between the hierarchical orders of the created world and the roots of all beings implanted in the world of the 
<e>sefirot</e>
. A Neoplatonic influence is evident in the reflections of Isaac—e.g., the procession of things from the one and the corresponding return to the heart of the primordial undifferentiatedness, which is the fullness of being and at the same time every conceivable being. This return is not merely eschatological and cosmic but is realized in the life of prayer of the contemplative mystic—though it is not, indeed, a transforming union by which the human personality blends completely into the Deity or becomes one with it. 
</p>


-<p>
The synthesis of the themes of the 
<e>Bahir</e>
and the cosmology of the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
, accomplished by Isaac or by others in the doctrinal environment inspired by his teachings, was and remains the foundation of Kabbala, whatever adjustments, changes of orientation, or radical modifications the composite may subsequently have undergone.

<headtitle>School of Gerona (Catalonia)</headtitle>


-<p>
The gnosticizing theosophy of the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
and the contemplative mysticism of the masters of Languedoc became one in the hands of the Kabbalists in Catalonia, where the Jewish community of Gerona was a veritable seat of esoterism during the first half of the 13th century. To the school of Gerona belong, among others, masters such as Ezra ben Solomon, Azriel of Gerona, Jacob ben Sheshet, and Moses ben Naḥman (or 
<xref topicid="401779" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650434">Naḥmanides</xref>
), the famous Talmudist, biblical commentator, and theologian. Their influence on the subsequent course of Jewish mysticism is of fundamental importance, though none of them left a complete synthesis of his theosophy. They expressed themselves, with more or less reserve, by means of commentaries, sermons, polemic or apologetic treatises, and brief summaries (at most) for the noninitiated. It is not impossible, however, to discover through these texts their vision of the world and to compare it with the views of the Jewish thinkers who attempted to harmonize the biblical-rabbinical tradition with Greco-Arab philosophy, whether of Neoplatonic or Aristotelian inspiration. 
</p>


-<p>
At the base of the Kabbalistic view of the world there is an option of faith: it is by a voluntary decision that the unknowable Deity—who is “nothing” or “nothingness” (nonfinite) because he is a fullness of being totally inaccessible to any human cognition—sets into motion the process that leads to the visible world. This concept radically separates Kabbala from the determinism from which the philosophy of the period could not, without contradiction, free the principle of being. In addition, it offers a solution consistent with faith to the problem of creation ex nihilo (out of nothing). The paradoxical reinterpretation of the concept of the “nothing” eliminates the original matter coeternal with God and solves the opposition between divine transcendence (remoteness from the world) and immanence (presence in the world); issuing from the unfathomable depth of the Deity and called to return to it, the world, visible as well as invisible, is radically separated from God, who is at the same time constantly present. The correspondence between the 
<e>sefirot</e>
and all the degrees of being gives meaning to the structure of the world and to the history of humanity centred on the revelation given to the chosen people, a revelation that is a rule of life for this people and the criterion of merit and sin, or good and evil. Thus, from the top to the bottom of the ladder, there are corresponding realities that control one another. Contrary to the opinion of the philosophers, evil is also a reality since it is the rupture of the universal harmony. It is also the consequence of this rupture, in the form of punishment. From this perspective, scrupulous observance of the Torah, both in the written text and the 
<xref topicid="212142" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">oral tradition</xref>
, is the essential factor for the maintenance of the universe. The “rational” motivation of the commandments, which raises insurmountable difficulties for the theologians of philosophical orientation, is in the eyes of the Kabbalists a false problem; the real problem is the fundamental nature of the Torah. Kabbala brings more than one solution to it, whereas philosophy has trouble providing a single coherent and comprehensive solution. 
</p>


-<p>
It follows from this general concept that the Jewish faith, with its implications—the conviction of holding the undiluted truth, the faithful preservation of ritual practices, and the eschatological expectation—is safeguarded from all the doubts that either philosophical speculation or the rival religious doctrines of Christianity and 
<xref topicid="295765" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islam</xref>
could evoke in the minds of Jewish believers. Kabbala, already at the stage it had reached at Gerona, may be said to be a significant factor in the survival of Judaism, which was exposed everywhere in medieval society to a wide range of perils. 
</p>


-<p>
Besides the Gerona school and the doctrinal descendants of Isaac the Blind in Languedoc, there was another school of Jewish esoterism in southern Europe during the first half of the 13th century. Members of this school preferred to remain anonymous and therefore published their writings, such as the 
<e>Sefer ha-ʿiyyun</e>
(“Book of Speculation”), either without an author’s name or with an attribution to a fictitious authority. Their speculation was directed to the highest levels of the divine world, where it discerned aspects beyond the 10 
<e>sefirot</e>
and attempted to give an idea of them by resorting to the symbolism of light, as well as to the primordial causes and the archetypes contained in the Deity or directly issuing from it. The sometimes-striking similarity between these speculations and those of the Christian theologian 
<xref topicid="191466" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621152">John Scotus Erigena</xref>
(810–
<e>c.</e>
877), whose work was revived in the 12th and 13th centuries, suggests not only a kinship of themes between this Kabbalistic current and Latin-language Christian Neoplatonism but also a concrete influence of the latter upon the former. The same may be true of Isaac the Blind and the school of Gerona, but certain knowledge is lacking.

This very obscure document claims to explain the figures of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The speculation of this treatise bears on two themes that were not foreign to the school of Gerona, but it develops them in a personal manner that decisively influenced the future of Jewish theosophy. On the one hand, it deals with a theory of the different cycles through which the world must travel from the time of its emergence to its reabsorption into the primordial unity. On the other hand, it addresses various readings that correspond to these cycles in the divine manifestation that is constituted by the Scriptures. In other words, the interpretation and consequently the message of the Torah vary according to the cycles of existence; the passage to a cycle other than that under whose governance humanity is presently living could thus entail the modification, even the abrogation, of the rule of life to which the chosen people are presently subject, an explosive notion that threatened to overthrow the Jewish tradition.

Medieval German (
<xref topicid="38290" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ashkenazic</xref>
) Hasidism 
</headtitle>


-<p>
The period during which Kabbala was established in the south of France and in Spain is no less important for the shaping of Jewish mysticism in the other branch of European Judaism, which was situated in northern France (and England) and in the Rhine and Danube regions of Germany. Unlike medieval Kabbala, which experienced a broad and varied development starting in the second half of the 13th century, the movement designated as German, or Ashkenazic (from a biblical place-name conventionally used to designate Germany), Hasidism hardly survived as a living and independent current beyond the second quarter of the 13th century (it has no connection with modern Hasidism). Franco-German Judaism experienced a certain continuity of mystical tradition, based on the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
and the 
<e>hekhalot</e>
(
<e>see above</e>


-<xref topicid="307197" tocid="35324" ty="3" refid="1639172">

<e>Sefer yetzira</e>

</xref>
); certain elements of theurgy and magic of Babylonian origin may also have reached it through Italy; and apparently the gnosticizing current that was crystallized in the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
did not pass without leaving traces in Germany. The intellectual atmosphere of Franco-German Judaism, however, differed greatly from that reigning in Spain or even Provence and Languedoc. It was characterized by an almost exclusively Talmudic culture, less intellectual contact with the non-Jewish environment than in the countries of Muslim civilization, and a very limited knowledge of Jewish theology in Arabic from the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. This situation did not change until the last third of the 12th century; until then, the “philosophical” equipment of the Franco-German Jewish scholar consisted essentially of a Hebrew paraphrase, dating perhaps from the 11th century, of the treatise 
<e>Beliefs and Opinions</e>
by Saʿadia ben Joseph (the great 9th–10th-century Babylonian Jewish scholar and philosopher) and the commentary on the 
<e>Sefer yetzira</e>
written in Hebrew in 946 by the Italian physician Shabbetai Donnolo (born 913). Even when the cultural influence of Spanish Judaism came to be felt more strongly in France, England, and Germany, speculative Kabbala hardly penetrated there. Franco-German Jewish thinkers who inclined toward theological speculation had their own problems—notably the persecutions that began during the First Crusade—which resulted in a mysticism strongly imbued with asceticism. 
</p>


-<p>
The main speculative problem for medieval Hasidic thinkers was that of the relationship between God and his manifestations in creation, including his revelation and communication with inspired men and women. Reflection on this problem led to the elaboration of various supernatural hierarchies between the inaccessible God and the created universe or the recipient of divine communication. Data on angels taken from the Bible and rabbinical and mystical traditions, as well as speculation on the Shekhina, were used as material for these hierarchies and also gave a peculiar coloration to liturgical practice. The latter was marked, moreover, by a concern for spiritual concentration by means of fixing attention on the words and even the letters of the synagogue 
<xref topicid="474128" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">prayers</xref>
. These speculations, however, had no great repercussions on the subsequent course of Jewish esoterism; the only exception is the mysticism of prayer and demonology, which was sometimes influenced by the beliefs of the Christian environment and was fully developed in Hasidic circles. On the other hand, the ascetic morality of the movement, which was expressed in the literary works of 
<xref topicid="182298" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621153">Eleazar ben Judah of Worms</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1160–1238) and in the two recensions of the “Book of the Pious” (

Once the marginal episode of

-<p>
After the flowering of the schools described above came to an end about the year 1260, two other currents appeared. The first assumed a gnostic bent through its emphasis on the 
<xref topicid="197324" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639184">problem of evil</xref>
. The texts that illustrate this tendency do not place evil in a state of dependence on the “attribute of judgment” within the structure of the 
<e>sefirot</e>
set up by the previous Kabbalists but locate it outside the Divinity, constructing a parallel system of “left-hand 
<e>sefirot</e>
” and a corresponding exuberant demonology. The second movement, whose main representative was the visionary and adventurer Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (born 1240), justified itself by appeal to inner “prophetic” experiences encouraged by training methods akin to those of 
<xref topicid="653408" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650462">Yoga</xref>
, Byzantine 
<xref topicid="264170" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650461">Hesychasm</xref>
(mystical, quietist monasticism), and 
<xref topicid="571823" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sufism</xref>
. Moreover, an important place was given to speculations on the letters and vocalic signs of the Hebrew script. Unlike the protagonists of other mystical schools of Spain, Abulafia actively promoted his ideas, worrying Jewish leaders and prompting even non-Jewish authorities to pursue him. His numerous writings later stimulated a few minds among the Kabbalists. 
</p>


-<p>
The work of 
<xref topicid="393604" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621236">Moses de León</xref>
(1250–1305) marked one of the most important turning points in the development of Jewish mysticism. He was the author of several esoteric works, which he signed with his own name. In order to better spread his ideas and to more effectively combat philosophy, which he considered a mortal danger to the Jewish faith, he composed pseudepigrapha (writings ascribed to other authors, usually in past ages) in the form of Midrashim on the Pentateuch, the Song of Solomon, the 
<xref topicid="514202" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Ruth</xref>
, and Lamentations; only the names of the Talmudic authorities were even partially authentic, a procedure already used by the 
<e>Sefer ha-bahir</e>
. In its most finished version (for there were several of them), the plot of the tales centred around Rabbi 
<xref topicid="545070" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621238">Simeon ben Yoḥai</xref>
, a sage of the 2nd century, about whom the Talmud already related some curious anecdotes, most of them semilegendary. Moses de León thus produced over a period of about 30 years the 
<e>Midrash ha-neʿelam</e>
(“The Mystical Midrash”), an allegorical work written mainly in Hebrew, and then the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="532573" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Sefer ha-zohar</xref>

</e>
(“Book of Splendour”)—or, more briefly, the 
<e>Zohar</e>
—a larger work written in artificial Aramaic, whose content is theosophic. The 
<e>Zohar</e>
culminates in a long speech in which Simeon ben Yoḥai, on the day of his death, supposedly exposes the quintessence of his mystical doctrine. The book inspired nearly contemporary imitations that were incorporated into it or appended to it but were sometimes of a markedly different theological orientation: the 
<e>Raʿya mehemana</e>
(“Faithful Shepherd”—i.e., 
<xref topicid="393555" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses</xref>
the prophet), the particular subject of which is the interpretation and theosophic justification of the precepts of the Torah; and the 
<e>Tiqqune zohar</e>
, consisting of elaborations in the same vein bearing upon the first word of the book of Genesis (
<e>bereshit</e>
, “in the beginning”). 
</p>


-<p>
The works of Moses de León were not immediately accepted as authentic by all the esoterists and still less by scholars outside the theosophic movement. It took half a century or more for the 
<e>Zohar</e>
and imitations of it to be recognized as authoritative ancient works, and even then it was not without some reluctance. Although critics were never fully silenced and the authenticity of the 
<e>Zohar</e>
was already questioned in the 15th century, the myth created by Moses de León and his imitators became a spiritual reality for the majority of believing Jews, and it still retains this character among many “traditional” Jews. The 
<e>Zohar</e>
, believed to be based on supernatural revelations and reinterpreted in diverse ways, served as a support and reference for all Jewish theosophies in later centuries. 
</p>


-<p>
In matters of doctrine, the 
<e>Zohar</e>
and its appendices develop, amplify, and exaggerate speculation and tendencies that already existed rather than offer any radical innovation. The main lines of the 
<e>Zohar</e>
—the springing forth of being from the depth of the divine “nothing,” the solidarity between the visible world and the world of the 
<e>sefirot</e>
(complicated by the introduction of four ontological levels, at each of which the schema of the 10 
<e>sefirot</e>
is reproduced), the indispensable contribution to universal harmony by the people (i.e., the Jews) who observe the biblical and rabbinical precepts in their slightest details—were ideas that had been accepted for a long time in Jewish theosophy. But all of these themes were largely organized and enhanced by the use—or rather the unscrupulous appropriation—of materials taken from rabbinical tradition and ancient esoterism as well as from more recent currents of theological and philosophical thought (the speculations of the 
<e>Sefer ha-temuna</e>
on the cosmic cycles and the “Prophetic Kabbala” of Abulafia were tacitly set aside). 
</p>


-<p>
Despite the lack of esteem that the writers of the Zoharic corpus felt—and sought to make others feel—toward works created by Gentiles, the method of symbolic representation used in the Zoharic writings was supported by a system of interpretation based on the originally Christian concept of the fourfold meaning of Scripture: literal, moral, allegorical (philosophical), and mystical. The symbolism that was thus established boldly made use of an exuberant anthropomorphic and even erotic imagery whose function was to convey the manifestation of the levels of the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="532613" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">sefirot</xref>

</e>
to each other and to the extra-divine world. The myth of the primordial man (Adam Qadmon), a virtually divine being, reappeared here under a new form, and it remained in the subsequent development of Kabbala. 
</p>


-<p>
The 
<e>Zohar</e>
thus claims to provide a complete explanation of the world, humankind, history, and the situation of the Jews; on a higher level, it purports to justify the biblical revelation and rabbinical tradition down to the slightest detail, including the messianic expectation, and thereby to neutralize philosophy. But, while portraying itself as the defender of the traditional religion regulated by the Talmud and its commentaries, the 
<e>Zohar</e>
places itself above tradition by boisterously proclaiming the incomparable value of the theosophic teaching of Rabbi Simeon ben Yoḥai and the superiority of the esoteric doctrine over Talmudic studies. There was in this attitude—which was more accentuated in the 
<e>Raʿya mehemana</e>
than in the 
<e>Zohar</e>
proper—a revolutionary potential and a threat to the primacy of Torah practice and study. The future would show that this danger was not completely unreal.

<headtitle>The Lurianic Kabbala</headtitle>


-<p>
After the establishment of the Zoharic corpus, no major changes took place in Jewish esoterism until the middle of the 16th century, when a religious centre of extreme importance for Judaism, mainly inspired by teachers coming from families expelled from Spain, was established in Safed (in Upper Galilee, Palestine; present-day 
<xref topicid="656253" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ẕefat</xref>
, Israel). Kabbalistic literary output had been abundant in Spain until the expulsion in 1492 and in Italy and the Middle East during the following two generations, but it was primarily a matter of systematizing or even popularizing the 
<e>Zohar</e>
or of extending the speculation already developed in the 13th century. There were also some attempts at reconciling philosophy and Kabbala. 
</p>


-<p>
The expulsion from Spain and the forced conversions to Christianity in both Spain and Portugal were profound tragedies. These events accentuated the existing pessimism caused by the dispersal of the Jews among the nations and intensified messianic expectation. This expectation most likely contributed to the beginnings of the printed transmission of Kabbala; the first two printed editions of the 
<e>Zohar</e>
date from 1558. All these factors, joined with certain internal developments of speculative Kabbala in the 15th century, prepared the ground for the new theosophy inaugurated by the teaching of

(1534–72), who was born in Jerusalem, educated in Egypt, and died in Safed. Although his teaching is traditionally associated with Safed, he spent only the last three years of his life there. Luria wrote very little; his doctrine was transmitted, amplified, and probably somewhat distorted through the works of his disciples, especially 
<xref topicid="630904" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621242">Ḥayyim Vital</xref>
(1543–1620), who wrote 
<e>ʿEtz ḥayyim</e>
(“Tree of Life”), the standard presentation of Lurianic Kabbala. 
</p>


-<p>
The theosophy of Luria, whose novelty was proclaimed by its creator, was perfectly realized by the esoterists who held to the Zoharistic Kabbala, which was organized and codified precisely in Safed during the lifetime of Luria by 
<xref topicid="137433" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650544">Moses ben Jacob Cordovero</xref>
(1522–70). Although its details are extremely complex, it is basically an attempt to reconcile divine transcendence with immanence and to solve the problem of evil, which the believer in the divine unity can recognize neither as a power existing independently of God nor as an integral part of him. 
</p>


-<p>
The vision of Luria is expressed in a vast mythical construct, which is typologically akin to certain 
<xref topicid="236343" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">gnostic</xref>
and 
<xref topicid="362167" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621243">Manichaean</xref>
(3rd-century dualistic) systems but which strives at all costs to avoid dualism. The essential elements of this myth include the withdrawal (
<e>tzimtzum</e>
) of the divine light, which originally filled all things, in order to make room for the extra-divine; the sinking, as a result of a catastrophic event that occurred during this process, of luminous particles into matter (
<e>qelippot</e>
, “shells,” a term already used in Kabbala to designate the evil powers); and the consequent need to save these particles and return them to their origin, by means of “repair” or “restoration” (
<e>tiqqun</e>
). This must be the work of the Jews who not only live in complete conformity to the religious duties imposed on them by tradition but who dedicate themselves, in the framework of a strict asceticism, to a contemplative life founded on mystical prayer and directed meditation (
<e>kawwana</e>
) on the liturgy, which is supposed to further the harmony (
<e>yiḥud</e>
, “unification”) of the innumerable attributes within the divine life. The successive reincarnations of the soul, a constant theme of Kabbala that Lurianism developed, are also invested with an important function in the work of “repair.” In short, Lurianism proclaims the absolute requirement of an intense mystical life with an unceasing struggle against the powers of evil. Thus, it presents a myth that symbolizes the world’s origin, fall, and redemption. It also gives meaning to the existence and hopes of the Jews, not merely exhorting them to a patient surrender to God but moving them to a redeeming activism, which is the measure of their sanctity. Such requirements make the ideal of Lurianism possible only for a small elite; ultimately, it is realizable only through the exceptional personage of the “just”—the ideal holy Jew.

-<p>
For 60 years after the death of Luria, his version of the Kabbala, together with accretions from the other mysticisms of Safed, spread through the Jewish Diaspora and deeply permeated its spiritual life, liturgy, and devotional practices. It emphasized the need for “repair” of a world in which Jewish uneasiness continued to grow; despite certain favourable factors—the relative tolerance of the 
<xref topicid="434996" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ottoman Empire</xref>
and the peaceful establishment of an important Marrano (Iberian Jewish, or Sephardic) community in Amsterdam—there was no overall solution to the problem of the 
<xref topicid="135817" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621244">conversos</xref>
who had remained in the 
<xref topicid="280587" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Iberian Peninsula</xref>
. The Ashkenazim also experienced a serious crisis: its most prosperous and dynamic section, the Jewish population of Poland, was sorely tried, almost totally ruined, and in large part forced to move back toward the west because of the massacres and the destruction that took place during the Cossack uprising of 1648. 
</p>


-<p>
These ideological and historical data may provide the necessary context for understanding the astonishing though short-lived success of Rabbi 
<xref topicid="537449" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621245">Shabbetai Tzevi</xref>
of Smyrna (1626–76), who proclaimed himself 
<xref topicid="377146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">messiah</xref>
in 1665. Although the “messiah” was forcibly converted to Islam in 1666 and ended his life in exile 10 years later, he continued to have faithful followers. A sect was thus born and survived, largely thanks to the activity of Nathan of Gaza (
<e>c.</e>
1644–90), an unwearying propagandist who justified the actions of 
<xref topicid="537449" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shabbetai Tzevi</xref>
, including his final apostasy, with theories based on the Lurian doctrine of “repair.” Tzevi’s actions, according to Nathan, should be understood as the descent of the just into the abyss of the “shells” in order to liberate the captive particles of divine light. 
</p>


-<p>
The Shabbetaian crisis lasted nearly a century, and some of its aftereffects lasted even longer. It led to the formation of sects whose members were externally converted to Islam—e.g., the 
<xref topicid="169152" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650597">Dönme</xref>
(Turkish: “Apostates”) of Salonika, whose descendants still live in Turkey—or to 
<xref topicid="507284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Roman Catholicism</xref>
—e.g., the Polish supporters of 
<xref topicid="217179" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621246">Jacob Frank</xref>
(1726–91), the self-proclaimed messiah and Catholic convert (in Bohemia-Moravia, however, the Frankists outwardly remained Jews). This crisis did not discredit Kabbala, but it did lead Jewish spiritual authorities to monitor and severely curtail its spread and to use censorship and other acts of repression against anyone—even a person of tested piety and recognized knowledge—who was suspected of Shabbetaian sympathies or messianic pretensions.

<headtitle>Modern Hasidism</headtitle>

<p>Although the messianic movement centred around Shabbetai Tzevi produced only disillusionment and could have led to the destruction of Judaism, it answered both the theosophic aspirations of a small number of visionary scholars and the affective need of the Jewish masses that was left unsatisfied by the dry intellectualism of the Talmudists and the economic and social oppression of the ruling classes (both Jewish and non-Jewish). This was the case especially in Poland, which before the partition of the Polish kingdom (1772–95) included Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian territories. It was there that the Hasidic movement originated around the middle of the 18th century (it was in no way connected with medieval German Hasidism). While maintaining the Lurian Kabbala as a theoretical basis of speculation, the movement also made adjustments and transformations that continue to the present day.</p>


-<p>
Modern Hasidism may be regarded as a mass movement having a minimum of organization and relying on itinerant teachers and preachers. According to legend, it was founded by 
<xref topicid="47272" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Israel ben Eliezer</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1700–60), known as 
<xref topicid="47272" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621247">Baʿal Shem Ṭov</xref>
(“Master of the Good Name”; that is, a possessor—he was not the only one of his kind—of the secret of the ineffable name of God, which bestows an infallible power to heal and perform other miracles). Although relatively untrained according to the norms of the rabbinical Judaism of his time, he was a spiritual person of exceptional quality and was able to win to his ideas not only the common people but also many representatives of the intellectual elite. The mist of legend that surrounds him makes it impossible to reconstruct his entire doctrine, which he probably never systematized. Inspired by the methods of the itinerant preachers whose activity was becoming more intense among eastern European Jews in the 18th century, his teaching took the form of homiletic interpretations of sacred texts based on fables and parables borrowed from daily life and from folklore. Although this method remained constant in Hasidism, it is a mistake to conclude, as did 
<xref topicid="82688" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Martin Buber</xref>
, that the tale and the anecdote are the most authentic expression of the doctrine and spirituality of Hasidism. Indeed, the thought of the Hasidic “rabbis” is best expressed in doctrinal works, most of which took the form of sermons on the weekly sections of the Pentateuch and other liturgical lessons. It is a very diversified thought, for there are as many bodies of doctrine in Hasidism as there were creative spirits during the first three generations of the movement. It is possible nevertheless to point to a few traits that are fundamental and common to Hasidism as a whole. 
</p>


-<p>
In theory, Hasidism remains rooted in the Lurianic Kabbala, and nothing essential separates it at this point from the traditional Judaism of eastern Europe. It is unique, however, because it made 

-<e>

<xref topicid="160146" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">devequt</xref>

</e>
, “being-with-God,” an object of aspiration and even a constant duty for all Jews and in all circumstances of life, even those seemingly most profane. In other words, it demands a total spiritualization of Jewish existence. This requirement entails a reevaluation, less new in its principle than in its concrete application, of the speculative concepts of Kabbala. Emphasis is placed on the inner life of the believer, and it is on this level that the supercosmic drama (whose stage is in the universe of the 
<e>sefirot</e>
, according to bookish theosophy) is played out. According to several teachers, the same emphasis on inwardness holds for messianic redemption. Hasidism also transforms into social reality a requirement that was part of the Lurian doctrine of “repair,” though it was unfortunately distorted by Shabbetaianism: it puts the inspired leader—an indispensable guide and unquestioned authority endowed with supernatural powers, the “just” (

-<e>

<xref topicid="612044" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">tzaddiq</xref>

</e>
), the “miracle-working rabbi” (
<e>Wunder-rebbe</e>
)—at the centre of the group’s organization and religious life. Hasidism thus produced, wherever it triumphed, an undeniable spiritual renewal. On the other hand, it was plagued by the cult of personality, by competition between “dynasties” of “rabbis,” and by the social and economic consequences of its obstinate insistence on isolating the Hasidic community from the surrounding society. 
</p>


-<p>
From its very beginnings, Hasidism encountered strong resistance from official Judaism, which had been sensitized to the anarchism of the Shabbetaians and which at the same time was solicitous toward the prerogatives of the community leaders and rabbis. The behaviour of the followers of Hasidism, though irreproachable in its rigorous observance of ritual rules, displayed several traits that were distasteful to its adversaries (besides the unconditional submission to the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="612044" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">tzaddiq</xref>

</e>
, who often doubled as the rabbi of the official congregation): desertion of the general communal synagogues, meetings in small conventicles, modifications of the liturgy, excessively formal dress during prayer, and preference given to mystical meditation rather than to the dialectical study of the Talmud, which required serious intellectual concentration. Nevertheless, the conflict between the Hasidim and the “Opponents” (Mitnaggedim) did not finally degenerate into schism; after three generations, a tacit compromise was established between the two tendencies—Hasidic and Mitnaggedic—though awareness of their differences was never erased. The compromise was somewhat to the advantage of Hasidism, but not without a few concessions on its part, notably on the question of education. 
</p>


-<p>
The strong organization of the Hasidic groups allowed them to survive the dislocation of eastern European Judaism as a result of the events of 
<xref topicid="648813" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">World War II</xref>
, but its vital centres are today in the 
<xref topicid="616563" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">United States</xref>
rather than in Palestine, partly for economic reasons and partly because of the more or less reserved, and sometimes hostile, attitude of the Hasidic “rabbis” toward political 
<xref topicid="657475" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621248">Zionism</xref>
and the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">State of Israel</xref>
. The best-known of the U.S.-based groups is the very active Lubavitchers (named after Lyubavichi, Russia, seat of a famous school of Hasidism), whose headquarters are in the Crown Heights district of Brooklyn, New York.

<headtitle>Modern Jewish mysticism</headtitle>


-<p>
The role played by Kabbala and Hasidism in the thought and spirituality of contemporary Judaism is far from insignificant, though its importance is not as great as in former times. Although there is hardly any living Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature, the personal thought of religious writers such as 
<xref topicid="321976" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621249">Abraham Isaac Kook</xref>
(
<e>c.</e>
1865–1935)—spiritual leader, mystic, and 
<xref topicid="110793" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">chief rabbi</xref>
of Palestine—remains influential. Furthermore, religious thought in Westernized Jewish circles between the two World Wars received a powerful stimulus from the philosopher 
<xref topicid="82688" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Martin Buber</xref>
, whose work is in part devoted to the propagation of Hasidic ideology as he understood it. “Neo-Orthodoxy,” the theological system founded in Germany by 
<xref topicid="266851" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621250">Samson Raphael Hirsch</xref>
(1808–88), was indifferent to mysticism at the outset, but it too came to be influenced by it, especially after the rediscovery of living Judaism in Poland during 
<xref topicid="648646" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">World War I</xref>
by Western Jewish thinkers. Also significant is the work of 
<xref topicid="264049" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621251">Abraham Joshua Heschel</xref>
(1907–72), a Polish Jewish theologian of distinguished Hasidic background and dual culture—traditional and Western. 
</p>


-<p>
Jewish mysticism has exerted influence outside the Jewish community. Kabbala, distorted and deflected from its own intentions, has helped to nourish and stimulate certain currents of thought in Christian society since the Renaissance. “
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christian</xref>
Kabbala,” born in the 15th century under the impetus of Jewish converts from Spain and Italy, claimed to find in the Kabbalistic documents—touched up or even forged if necessary—arguments for the truths of the Christian faith. A certain number of Christian humanist scholars became interested in Jewish mysticism, and several of them acquired a fairly extensive knowledge of it on the basis of authentic texts. Among them were 
<xref topicid="459504" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621252">Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</xref>
(1463–94) and Gilles of Viterbo (Egidio da Viterbo; 
<e>c.</e>
1465–1532) in Italy; 
<xref topicid="500213" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621253">Johannes Reuchlin</xref>
(1455–1522) in Germany, who wrote one of the principal expositions of Kabbala in a language accessible to the learned non-Jewish public (
<e>De arte Cabbalistica</e>
, 1517); and the visionary Guillaume Postel (1510–81) in France. The occult philosophy of the 16th century, the “natural philosophy” of the 17th and 18th centuries, and the occult and theosophic theories that are cultivated even today and that have coloured the ideology of 
<xref topicid="218618" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639374">Freemasonry</xref>
—all of these continue to borrow from Kabbala, though they rarely grasp its spirit and meaning. The same is true of most of the books on Kabbala put out by publishers of occult and theosophic literature today. 
</p>


-<p>
The scholarly study of Jewish mysticism is a very recent phenomenon. The state of mind and the tendencies of the founders of the “science of Judaism” (the scholarly study of Jewish religion, literature, and history) in Germany during the first half of the 19th century were too permeated with rationalism to be favourable to scholarly investigation of a movement judged to be obscurantist and retrograde. Although there were some valuable early studies, research on a large scale and application of the proved methods of philology and history of religions began only with the work of Gershom G. Scholem (1897–1982) and his disciples. This research addressed all the many areas of Jewish mysticism, but in every area the gaps in knowledge remain serious. Critical editions of mystical texts are few in number; unpublished documents are cataloged incompletely; and only a few monographs on writers and particular themes exist, though these are indispensable preliminaries to a detailed and thorough synthesis. It is to be hoped that the synthesis outlined by Scholem in his 
<e>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</e>
(1941), though exceptionally valuable in its time, will be taken up again and completed.

</headtitle>


-<p>
Jewish myth and legend comprises a vast body of stories transmitted over the past 3,000 years in Hebrew and in the vernacular dialects spoken by Jews, such as 
<xref topicid="653224" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621254">Yiddish</xref>
(Judeo-German) and 
<xref topicid="327512" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621255">Ladino</xref>
(Judeo-Spanish). These stories have played an important role in the history of Jewish religion and culture.Virtually all the standard types of folktales are represented. Conspicuously absent, however, are pure fairy tales, because fairies, elves, and the like are foreign to the Jewish imagination, which prefers to populate the otherworld with angels and demons subservient to God. 
</p>


-<h3 tocid="35339">

<headtitle>Significance and characteristics</headtitle>


-<p>
Apart from their intrinsic appeal, Jewish myths and legends claim attention for three special reasons: (1) Those incorporated in the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
are now part and parcel of the cultural heritage of the Western world and have exerted a profound influence on its literature and art. (2) During the Middle Ages, Jews were among the principal transmitters of Middle Eastern and North African tales to the West, so that many familiar Eastern stories can be traced to Jewish compilations. (3) Since these stories have been accumulated through centuries of constant migration, they provide an unrivalled body of “clinical” material for studying the processes by which popular tales in fact travel and are transformed. 
</p>

<p>Not all of the stories are of Jewish origin; many have parallels elsewhere and are derived from tales the Jews picked up from their non-Jewish neighbours in the lands of their dispersion. Even what is borrowed, however, is usually impressed with a distinctive Jewish stamp. The tales were often adapted to point up some precept of the Jewish religion, to illustrate some facet of Jewish life, or to exemplify some trait of Jewish character and temperament. The dominant feature of the stories is their religious and moral tone; most of them are told specifically as part of the homiletic exposition of Scripture. Such stories are taught to Jews from early childhood as a regular part of their religious education. To the tradition-minded Jew, therefore, they are more than mere literary fancies. Biblical characters and events are presented more in the lineaments of later legend than in their original biblical form, and popular notions about heaven and hell, reward and punishment, the coming of the messiah, and the resurrection of the dead derive mainly from these sources rather than from Scripture itself.</p>


-<p>
A distinction must be made between myth and legend. In common parlance, a myth is a story about gods or otherworldly beings. In this sense, therefore, there can be no original Jewish myths, because Judaism is a rigorously 
<xref topicid="390101" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">monotheistic</xref>
religion. Nevertheless, from the earliest times, Jews have not disdained to borrow the myths of their pagan neighbours and adapt them to their own religious outlook. If, however, the term is interpreted in a larger sense to mean the portrayal of perennial concerns in the context of particular historical events, myth is indeed one of the essential vehicles by which Judaism conveys its message. It is only when historical happenings are translated into this wider dimension that they cease to be mere antiquarian data and acquire continuing relevance. In Judaism, for example, the 
<xref topicid="198216" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Exodus</xref>
from Egypt is projected mythically from something that happened at a particular time into something that is continually happening, and it comes to exemplify the situation and experience of all humans everywhere—their emergence from the bondage of obscurantism, their individual revelations at their individual Sinais, their trek through a figurative wilderness, even their death in it so that their children or children’s children may eventually reach the figurative “Promised Land.” By the same token, the historical destruction of the 
<xref topicid="302895" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Temple of Jerusalem</xref>
is transformed by myth into a paradigm of the continuing mutual estrangement of God and humans, their exile from one another. Legend, on the other hand, implies no more than a fanciful embroidering of purportedly historical fact. Unlike myth, it does not transcend the historical and the local.

</headtitle>

<p>The vast repertoire of Jewish myths and legends begins with the Hebrew Bible. Their overall purpose in Scripture is to illustrate the ways of God with humans, as exemplified both in historical events and in personal experience. The stories themselves are often derived from current popular lore and possess abundant parallels in other cultures, both ancient and modern. In each case, however, they are given a peculiar and distinctive twist.</p>


-<h5 tocid="35342">

<headtitle>Myths</headtitle>


-<p>
Biblical myths are found mainly in the first 11 chapters of 
<xref topicid="228795" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Genesis</xref>
, the first book of the Bible. They are concerned with the 
<xref topicid="142144" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">creation</xref>
of the world and the first man and woman, the origin of the current human condition, the primeval Deluge, the distribution of peoples, and the variation of languages. 
</p>


-<p>
The basic stories are derived from the popular lore of the ancient Middle East; parallels can be found in the extant literature of the peoples of the area. The 
<xref topicid="376928" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mesopotamians</xref>
, for instance, also knew of an earthly paradise such as 
<xref topicid="178998" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Eden</xref>
, and the figure of the 
<xref topicid="109581" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">cherubim</xref>
—properly griffins rather than angels—was known to the 
<xref topicid="578986" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Canaanites</xref>
. In the Bible, however, this mythical garden of the gods becomes the scene of man’s 
<xref topicid="432565" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">fall</xref>
and the background of a story designed to account for the natural limitations of human life. Similarly, the 
<xref topicid="47586" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Babylonians</xref>
told of the formation of humankind from clay. But, whereas in the pagan tale the first man’s function is to serve as an earthly menial of the gods, in the scriptural version his role is to rule over all other creatures. The story of the Deluge, including the elements of the ark and the dispatch of the raven and dove, appears already in the Babylonian myths of 
<xref topicid="233644" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621429">Gilgamesh</xref>
and Atrahasis. There, however, the hero is eventually made immortal, whereas in the Bible this detail is omitted because, to the Israelite mind, no child of woman could achieve that status. Lastly, while the story of the 
<xref topicid="47421" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621430">Tower of Babel</xref>
was told originally to account for the stepped temples (
<xref topicid="657111" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621431">ziggurats</xref>
) of Babylonia, to the Hebrew writer its purpose is simply to inculcate the moral lesson that humans should not aspire beyond their assigned station.

(the two latter portions of the Hebrew Bible) are allusions to other ancient myths—e.g., to that of a primordial combat between YHWH and a monster variously named 
<xref topicid="337936" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621432">Leviathan</xref>
(Wriggly), Rahab (Braggart), or simply Sir Sea or Dragon. The Babylonians told likewise of a fight between their god 
<xref topicid="364416" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621433">Marduk</xref>
and the monster Tiamat; the Hittites told of a battle between the weather god and the dragon Illuyankas; while a Canaanite poem from

<xref topicid="337936" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Leviathan</xref>
. Originally, this myth probably referred to the annual subjugation of the floods. 
</p>

<p>Ancient myths are utilized also in the form of passing allusions or poetic “conceits,” much as modern Westerners may speak of Cupid or the Muses. In the prophetic books, for example, there are references to a celestial upstart hurled to earth on account of his brashness and to the imprisonment of certain rebellious constellations.</p>

The prophets used myths paradigmatically to illustrate the hand of God in contemporary events or to reinforce their prophecies. Thus, to 
<xref topicid="295133" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Isaiah</xref>
the primeval dragon was the symbol of the continuing force of chaos and evil that will again have to be vanquished before the kingdom of God can be established on earth. Similarly, for 
<xref topicid="199484" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Ezekiel</xref>
the celestial upstart serves as the prototype of the prince of Tyre, destined for an imminent fall; and Habakkuk sees in the impending rout of certain invaders a repetition on the stage of history of YHWH’s mythical sortie against the monster of the sea.

On the other hand, it should be observed that many of the parallels commonly cited from the folklore of indigenous peoples may be mere repetitions of biblical material picked up from Christian missionaries.

Folktales in the Hebrew Bible sometimes serve to account for the names of places in Palestine or for the origins of traditional customs and institutions. Thus, the familiar story of the man who must struggle with the personified current of a river before he can cross it is localized (in Genesis) at the ford of Jabbok simply because that name suggests the Hebrew word 
<e>abḳ</e>
(“struggle”), and Samson’s felling of 1,000 Philistines with the jawbone of an ass is placed at Ramath-leḥi because 
<e>leḥi</e>
is Hebrew for “jawbone.” Similarly, a taboo against eating the thigh muscle of an animal is validated in Genesis by the legend that Jacob was struck in the hip when he fought with an otherworldly being at Penuel (“Face of God”). The custom of annually bewailing the vanished spirit of fertility is rationalized in Judges as a lamentation for the hapless daughter of 
<xref topicid="302656" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Jephthah</xref>
. 
</p>


-<p>
The Hebrew Bible also contains a few examples of fables (didactic tales in which animals or plants play human roles). Thus, the serpent in Eden talks to Eve, and Balaam’s ass not only speaks but also seeks to avoid an angel, unseen by Balaam, that is blocking the road, while trees compete for kingship in the celebrated parable of Jotham in Judges. Finally, in 
<xref topicid="304284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">the book of Job</xref>
(38:31) there are allusions to star myths concerning the binding of Orion (called “the Fool”) and the “chaining” of the Pleiades.

<headtitle>Contemporary interpretations</headtitle>

<p>The tendency to interpret biblical tales and legends as authentic historical records or as allegories or as the relics of solar, lunar, and astral myths is now a thing of the past. The modern folklorist is interested in the legends because they push back to remote antiquity several tales and motifs long known from later literature. For the theologian, however, they pose the deeper problem of distinguishing clearly between the permanent message of Scripture and the form in which it is conveyed. The process of “demythologization” is one of the central concerns of modern religious thought. It recognizes that the natural language of religious truth is myth; thus, the continuing relevance of ancient scriptures depends not on the total rejection of that vehicle but rather on the expansion and remodeling of it—i.e., on “remythologization” rather than demythologization. In the final analysis, the traditional portrayal of God himself is simply a mythical representation of ultimate reality, but that reality transcends the particular images in which it happens to be expressed. At the same time, it is important to note that, whereas in the modern world scriptural myths are generally understood as metaphors, in the ancient world they were accepted as literal statements of fact. Gods, for example, were not merely “personifications” of natural phenomena but rather the effective potencies of the phenomena themselves conceived from the start as personal beings.</p>

<xref topicid="32645" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">archangels</xref>

<xref topicid="29740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">apocalyptic</xref>
visions of heaven and hell and of the Last Days. Unfortunately, no Jewish texts of this genre from the Persian period are extant, so these new elements can be recognized only inferentially from their survival in later times—notably in products of the ensuing

The principal monument of Jewish story in the Persian period is the biblical

, a popular festival, which itself is probably a transformation of the Persian New Year. Leading elements of the tale—such as the parade of Mordecai, dressed in royal robes, through the streets, the fight between the Jews and their adversaries, and the hanging of Haman and his sons—seem to reflect customs associated with Purim, such as the ceremonial ride of a common citizen through the capital, the mock combat between two teams representing the Old Year and the New Year, and the execution of the Old Year in effigy.

Judaism entered a new phase in 330

completed his conquest of the 
<xref topicid="381192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle East</xref>

<xref topicid="244670" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Greek</xref>
cultures. These found expression in Jewish myth and legend in the composition (in Greek) of stories designed to link the Bible with general history, to correlate biblical and Greek legends, and to claim for the Hebrew patriarchs a major role in the development of the arts and sciences. It was asserted, for instance, that 
<xref topicid="1544" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Abraham</xref>
had taught astrology to the king of Egypt, that his sons and those of Keturah had aided Heracles against the giant Antaeus, and that Moses, blithely identified both with the semi-mythical Greek poet Musaeus and with the Egyptian Thoth, had been the teacher of Orpheus (the putative founder of one of the current mystery cults) and the inventor of navigation, architecture, and the hieroglyphic script. Leading writers in this vein were Artapanus, Eupolemus, and Cleodemus (all 
<e>c.</e>
100 
<e ty="s">bce</e>

</p>


-<p>
The Jews also adapted the current Greek literary fashion of retelling Homeric and other ancient legends in “modernized,” novelistic versions, well seasoned with romantic elaborations of their own traditions. A paraphrase of Genesis found among the Dead Sea Scrolls ornaments the biblical narrative with several familiar folklore motifs. Thus, when Noah is born, the house is filled with light, just as it is said elsewhere to have been at the birth of the Roman king 
<xref topicid="536028" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621444">Servius Tullius</xref>

</p>


-<p>
The Apocrypha include several Judaized versions of tales well represented in other cultures. The book of 
<xref topicid="597793" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621450">Tobit</xref>
, for instance, turns largely on the widespread motifs of 
<xref topicid="242238" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621449">the “grateful dead”</xref>
and the demon in the bridal chamber. The former relates how a traveller who gives burial to a dishonoured corpse is subsequently aided by a chance companion who turns out to be the spirit of the deceased. The latter tells how a succession of bridegrooms die on the nuptial night through the presence of a demon beside the bridal bed. Similarly, in 
<xref topicid="59017" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Bel and the Dragon</xref>
(2nd century 
<e ty="s">bce</e>
) there is the equally familiar motif of fraud that is detected by the imprint of the culprit’s foot on strewn ashes; the story reappears later in the French and Celtic romance of 
<xref topicid="605914" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621451">Tristan and Iseult</xref>

Midrash and 
<xref topicid="251535" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Haggada</xref>

</headtitle>


-<p>
Toward the end of the 1st century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
, the canon of the Hebrew Bible was formed when certain Hebrew writings were recognized as the authoritative corpus of divine revelation. The study of the Bible became an essential element of the Jewish religion, which meant that the sacred text had to be subjected to a form of interpretation that would bring out its universal significance and permanent relevance. The process, known as Midrash (“interpretation” or “investigation”), involved the spicing of homiletic discourses with elaborative legends—a pedagogic device called Haggada (“Storytelling”). Originally transmitted orally, the legends were eventually committed to writing as part of the Talmud (the authoritative compendium of Oral Law and commentary on it), as well as in later compilations geared to particular books or sections of the Hebrew Bible, to scriptural lessons read in the services of the synagogue, or to specific biblical characters or moral themes. 
</p>

<p>The range of Haggada is virtually inexhaustible; a few representative examples must suffice. With regard to biblical characters, both Moses and David were born circumcised; Cain had a twin sister; Abraham will sit at the gate of hell to reproach the damned on Judgment Day; Aaron once locked the angel of death in the tabernacle; Solomon understood the language of animals; King Hiram, who supplied materials for the Temple, entered paradise alive; and the flesh of Leviathan will feed the righteous in the world to come.</p>


-<p>
In such fanciful elaborations of Scriptures, Haggada does not disdain to draw on 
<xref topicid="244670" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Classical</xref>
tales from 
<xref topicid="244231" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">ancient Greece</xref>
and Rome. The men of Sodom, it is said, subjected itinerant strangers to the ordeal of Procrustes’ bed; the earth opened to rescue newborn Hebrew males from the pharaoh, as it did for Amphiaraus, the prophet of Argos, when he fled from Periclymenus after the attack on Thebes; Moses spoke at birth, as did Apollo; Solomon’s ring, cast into the river, was retrieved from a fish that had swallowed it, as was that of Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, in the story told by Herodotus; the 
<xref topicid="539342" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Queen of Sheba</xref>
had the feet of an ass, like the child-stealing witch (Onoskelis) of Greek folklore; and no rain ever fell on the altar at Jerusalem, just as none was said to have fallen on 
<xref topicid="428145" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Mt. Olympus</xref>
. 
</p>

<p>There are other familiar motifs. Moses qualifies as a husband for Zipporah by alone being able to pluck a rod from Jethro’s garden; David’s harp is played at night by the wind, like that of Aeolus; and Isaiah, like Achilles and Siegfried, has only one vulnerable spot in his body—in his case, his mouth.</p>

<p>Legends are developed also from fanciful interpretations of scriptural verses. Thus, Adam is said to have fallen only a few hours after his creation, because the Hebrew text of Psalms 49:12 can be literally rendered “Adam does not last the night in glory.” Lamech slays the wandering Cain—a fanciful interpretation of his boast in Genesis 4:23–24. Melchizedek is immortal, in view of Psalms 110:4: “You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” And the first man is a hermaphrodite (this notion has analogues elsewhere), because Genesis 1:27 says of God’s creation, “Male and female he created them.”</p>

Several of the stories related in Haggadic literature were later adapted by Christian writers. The legend that 
<xref topicid="4992" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Adam</xref>
was created out of virgin soil was taken to prefigure the virgin birth of the second Adam (i.e., Jesus); while the story that the soil in question was taken from the site of the future Temple was transformed into the claim that Adam had been molded out of the dust of Calvary. Similarly, the legend that, at the dedication of the Temple, the doors swung open automatically to admit the Ark of the Covenant was transferred to the consecration of a church by 
<xref topicid="55066" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650668">St. Basil</xref>
(329–379); and the Talmudic tale that the bronze Nicanor gates of the Temple had floated to Jerusalem when cast overboard during their shipment from Alexandria was applied to the doors of a sacred edifice erected in honour of St. Giles (fl. 7th century).

Nor was it only the Christians who absorbed Haggadic legends. The

Apart from these Hebrew translations of Arabic and European works, a good deal of earlier Haggadic material is embodied in the

<headtitle>Major medieval Hebrew collections</headtitle>

From the 11th to the 13th century, comprehensive collections of tales and fables were compiled in Europe, both for entertainment and edification; standard examples are the Spanish 
<e>El novellino</e>
and the aforementioned 
<e>Disciplina clericalis</e>
and 
<e>Gesta Romanorum</e>
. Jews, especially in 
<xref topicid="392604" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Morocco</xref>
and in Islamic Spain, produced similar collections. Two of the most important were 
<e>The Book of Comfort</e>
by Nissim ben Jacob ben Nissim of Al-Qayrawān (11th century) and 
<e>The Book of Delight</e>
by Joseph ben Meir ibn Zabara of Spain (end of the 12th century). The former, composed in Judeo-Arabic, is a collection of some 60 moralizing tales designed to comfort the author’s father-in-law on the loss of a son. Belonging to a well-known genre of 
<xref topicid="31722" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Arabic literature</xref>
and derived mainly from Arabic sources, it is permeated by a preoccupation with divine justice, which was typical of the Muʿtazilite school of Islamic theology. It was later translated into Hebrew. 
<e>The Book of Delight</e>
consists of 15 tales, largely about the wiles of women, exchanged between two travelling companions—a form of cadre, or “enclosing tale,” later adopted on a more extensive scale in the 14th century in the

against making images, while his wife reaps rich rewards from the flattered princess. Although most of the stories are taken from Arabic sources, some have parallels in rabbinic literature—including the famous tale of the matron of Ephesus, who, while keeping vigil over her husband’s tomb, makes love with a guard posted nearby to watch over the corpses of certain crucified robbers. When, during one of their trysts, one of the corpses is stolen and her lover therefore faces punishment, the shrewd woman exhumes the body of her husband and substitutes it.

Of the same genre but deriving mainly from west European rather than Arabic sources are the

<headtitle>Medieval legendary histories and Haggadic compendiums</headtitle>


-<p>
Two other developments mark the history of Jewish myth and legend during the Middle Ages. The first was a revival of the Hellenistic predilection for large-scale compendiums in which the history of the Jews was “integrated,” in legendary fashion, with that of the world in general and especially with Classical traditions. Two major works of this kind, both composed (apparently) in Italy during the 9th century, are 
<e>Josippon</e>
, by a certain Ben Gorion, which presents a fanciful record from the Creation onward and contains numerous references to foreign nations; and the 

-<e>

<xref topicid="301488" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Book of Jashar</xref>

</e>
, a colourful account from Adam to Joshua, named for the ancient book of heroic songs and sagas mentioned in the Bible (Joshua 10:13; 2 Samuel 1:18). There is also the voluminous 
<e>Chronicles of Jerahmeel</e>
, written in the Rhineland in the 14th century, which draws largely on Pseudo-Philo’s earlier compilation and includes Hebrew and Aramaic versions of certain books of the Apocrypha. 
</p>


-<p>
The other development was the gathering of Haggadic legends and tales into comprehensive, systematic compendiums. Works of this kind are 
<e>Yalquṭ Shimʿoni</e>
(“The Collection of Simeon”), attributed to Rabbi Simeon of Frankfurt am Main; 
<e>Midrash ha-gadol </e>
(“The Great Midrash”), composed after the death in 1204 of 
<xref topicid="358539" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Moses Maimonides</xref>
, whom it quotes; and the 
<e>Midrash of David ha-Nagid</e>
, named after the grandson of Maimonides. About 100 years later a similar work on the Prophets and holy writings, 
<e>Yalquṭ ha-Makiri</e>
(“The Collection of Makhir”), was compiled by Makhir ben Abba Mari in Spain. It has been suggested that the production of such works was spurred by the necessity of providing “ammunition” for the public disputations with Christian ecclesiastics that the church forced upon Jewish scholars during this period.

tales 
</headtitle>


-<p>
In the 16th century, Jewish myth and legend took several new directions. The disappointment of messianic expectations through the dismal eclipse of the pretender 
<xref topicid="537449" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Shabbetai Tzevi</xref>
increased interest in occult speculation and in the mystical lore of the Kabbala. Important schools of Kabbala arose in Italy and at Safed, in Palestine, and tales of the miraculous Faust-like powers of masters such as 
<xref topicid="351761" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621463">Isaac Luria</xref>
(1534–72) and 
<xref topicid="630904" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1659317">Ḥayyim ben Joseph Vital</xref>
(also known as Ḥayyim Vital Calabrese) circulated freely after their deaths. 
</p>


-<p>
Another reaction to the dashing of messianic hopes is represented by the beautiful story of the Kabbalist Joseph della Reyna and his five disciples, who travel through the world to oust Satan and prepare the way for the Deliverer. Warned by the spirits of such worthies as Rabbi Simeon ben Yoḥai and the prophet Elijah, they nevertheless procure their blessing and are sent on to the angel Metatron. The latter furnishes them with protective spells and spices and advises Joseph to inscribe the ineffable name of God on a metal plate. When, however, they reach the end of their journey, Satan and his wife, 
<xref topicid="341009" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621464">Lilith</xref>
, attack them in the form of huge dogs. When the dogs are subdued, they beg for food, and Joseph gives them spices to revive them. At once they summon a host of devils, which causes two of the disciples to die of terror and two to go mad, leaving only Joseph and a disciple. The messiah weeps in heaven, and Elijah hides the great horn of salvation. A voice rings out telling Joseph that it is vain to attempt to hasten the footsteps of the Redeemer. 
</p>

<p>The repertoire of Jewish tales and legends was seasoned by other elements. During the 16th century—the age of the great European navigators—stories began to circulate about the discovery of the Ten Lost Tribes in remote parts of the world.</p>

</headtitle>


-<p>
In the 16th century, Judeo-German (Yiddish) came to replace Hebrew as the language of Jewish tales and legends in Europe, primarily because of the desire to render them accessible to women unschooled in the sacred tongue. The synagogal lessons from Scripture were embellished in Yiddish in the so-called 
<e>Taitsh Humesh </e>
(“Yiddish Pentateuch”), in the more fancifully titled 
<e>Tzeʾena u-reʾena</e>
(“Go Forth and See”; 
<e>compare</e>

<xref topicid="553534" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Song of Solomon</xref>
3:11), and in adaptations of the story of Esther designed for dramatic presentation on the 
<xref topicid="203113" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">feast</xref>
of Purim. The Hebrew 
<e>Chronicles of Josippon</e>
also assumed Yiddish dress. More-secular productions include a verse rendition of the Arthurian legend, titled 
<e>Artus Hof</e>
(“The Court of 
<xref topicid="36989" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">King Arthur</xref>
”) and based largely on Gravenberg’s medieval 
<e>Wigalois</e>
, and the 
<e>Bove Buch</e>
by 
<xref topicid="337988" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1650695">Elijah Levita</xref>
(1469–1549), which retold the romance of Sir Bevis of Southampton. 
</p>


-<p>
These “frivolous” productions were offset by collections of moral and ethical tales. The main examples of these are the 
<e>Brantspiegel</e>
(1572; “Brant Mirro”), attributed to Moses Henoch, and the 
<e>Maʿaseh Buch</e>
(1672; “Story Book”), a compendium of 254 tales compiled by Jacob ben Abraham of Meseritz and first published at Basel. The latter, drawn mainly from the Talmud, was supplemented by later legends about medieval rabbis. Jewish legends also circulated in the form of chapbooks, a large selection of which is preserved in the library of the Yiddish Scientific Institute in

-<p>
A similar development, though on a lesser scale, took place among Jews who spoke other vernacular dialects. Major monuments of Judeo-Persian literature are poetic embellishments of biblical narratives composed by Shāhīn of Shīrāz in the 14th century and by Joseph ben Isaac Yahudi (i.e., “the Jew”) some 300 years later. These, however, are exercises in virtuosity rather than in creative storytelling. Versified elaborations of the story of Joseph appear in Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) in 
<e>Coplas de Yoçef</e>
(“Song of Joseph”), composed in 1732 by Abraham de Toledo and embodying a certain amount of traditional Haggadic material. From a revival of literary activity in the 18th century comes a comprehensive “legendary Bible” called Me-ʿam LoʿḥḲ ą, “From a People of Strange Tongue” (
<e>compare</e>
Psalms 114:1), begun by Jacob Culi (died 1732) and continued by later writers, as well as several renderings of standard Hebrew collections and a number of Purim plays. Judeo-Spanish folktales were still current in Macedonia and Yugoslavia until the Nazi occupation of the early 1940s, but these stories drew more from Balkan than from Jewish sources.

<headtitle>Exclusivist and universalist emphases</headtitle>


-<p>
The biblical tradition out of which Judaism emerged was predominantly exclusivist (“no other gods”). The gods of the nations were regarded as “no gods” and their worshippers as deluded, while the God of Israel was acclaimed as the sole lord of history and the creator of heaven and earth. The unexpected universalist implications of this exclusivism are most forcibly expressed in an oft-quoted verse from 
<xref topicid="21365" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Amo</xref>
s (9:7):

-<qt>

<qtpara>“Are you not like the Ethiopians to me, O people of Israel?” says the Lord. “Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?”</qtpara>

</qt>

</p>

<p>Here the universal rule of the God of Israel is unmistakably proclaimed. Yet in the same book (3:1–2), after referring to the deliverance from Egypt—an act recognized as similar to that occurring in the affairs of other peoples—the prophet, speaking for God, says: “You only have I known of all the families of the earth.” Thus, the exclusivism has two focuses: one universal, the other particularistic. The ultimate claim of the universalistic position is found in Malachi 1:11: “For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations.” This, however, in no way negates the special covenantal relationship between God and his people, because this universalistic theme emphasizes that special bond. To interpret Judaism’s stance toward other religious systems in any other way is to fail to do justice to its inner dialectic. It is neither a bland latitudinarianism that admits any or all viewpoints and practices nor a fanatical intolerance but rather a subtle interplay of affirmation and rejection. The latter is directed primarily against idolatry—the basic failure of the peoples who are the objects of the same divine solicitude as is Israel. If the religions of the nations are rejected because of their failure to know God fully and truly, the peoples themselves are not. Living under the covenant with Noah, their fulfillment of such responsibilities provides for their acceptance, for they are not expected to live within the realm of Torah.</p>

Relation to 
<xref topicid="115240" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Christianity</xref>

</headtitle>

<p>Judaism’s relation to Christianity is complicated because of the close historical interconnections between them. From a Judaic standpoint, Christianity is or was a Jewish “heresy,” and, as such, it may be judged somewhat differently than other religions. Christianity’s claim to be the true fulfillment of the covenant—and, thus, the true Israel—has given rise throughout the centuries to polemics of varying intensity. The rise to power of the church and the embodiment of its anti-Judaic sentiments and attitudes in the political structures and processes of Christian nations made sharply negative Jewish responses inevitable. Nevertheless, during the Middle Ages, Jewish thinkers attempted to avoid designating Christianity as idolatry; some even argued that, because Christianity was derived from Judaism, it was fulfilling—at least on a moral plane—the divine purpose.</p>

<p>In modern times the relation between the two religions has undergone changes necessitated by the newer situations into which the Jewish community has moved. This does not mean that the polemical-apologetic stance came to an end. The rejection of Judaism as a living religion by some Christians has continued, though it was argued less on dogmatic than on scholarly grounds. The Jewish response has often been countercriticism. Beyond this, however, there has been a growing inclination within the Jewish community to respond to the development of an affirmative theology of Judaism in both the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches by providing a theology of Christianity within Jewish thought. Occasional formulations in this direction have appeared, but some within the Jewish community have seen no need for such a movement.</p>


-<p>
Beginning in the early 1960s many Christian churches, especially the 
<xref topicid="507284" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1810002">Roman Catholic</xref>
Church, began to rethink their relationship to Judaism. During the 
<xref topicid="624014" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1810003">Second Vatican Council</xref>
(1962–65), Pope 
<xref topicid="446981" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1838707">Paul VI</xref>
issued the declaration 
<e>Nostra aetate</e>
(“In Our Era”), which recognized the moral and historical integrity of Judaism, a remarkable reversal of centuries of Catholic teaching. 
<e>Nostra aetate</e>
also acknowledged Judaism as a vibrant religion with an identity independent of its role in the formation of historical Christianity. Most mainline 
<xref topicid="1354359" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1810004">Protestant</xref>
churches responded with a declaration similar to 
<e>Nostra aetate</e>
. During his pontificate, 
<xref topicid="305139" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1809600">John Paul II</xref>

The emergence of Islam in 
<xref topicid="31551" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Arabia</xref>
in the 7th century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
brought Judaism face to face with a second religious movement that derived some of its ideas and structures from the older tradition. In this case, as in that of Christianity, the new religion claimed a special relation with Judaism. Muhammad held that the faith he proclaimed was none other than the pristine religion of Abraham, the father of Ishmael (the progenitor of the Arabs) and Isaac (from whom the people of Israel descended). That religion had been distorted by both Judaism and Christianity, and Muhammad, the “seal” of the Prophets, had been called by God to restore it to its purity. The confrontation between Judaism and Islam, like that between Judaism and Christianity, was coloured by political and social considerations both before and after Islam spread beyond Arabia to other areas of the 
<xref topicid="381192" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Middle East</xref>
(including Palestine) and to parts of Europe. During the subsequent period, the intellectual development of the 
<xref topicid="295765" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Islamic world</xref>
and the emergence of theologians and philosophers of the highest order challenged Judaism and exerted considerable influence on similar thinkers within that community. Given the strong monotheism and the anti-iconic attitude of Islam, many of the questions that arose between Judaism and Trinitarian and iconic Christianity were not an issue between Judaism and Islam. Rather, the crucial point of dispute was the nature of prophecy, which arose because of Muhammad’s claim concerning his culminating role in the prophetic tradition. Thus, during the medieval period there were polemics directed against that claim, as well as expositions of the nature of prophecy that, without dealing directly with Muhammad’s claim, could be taken to undercut it—as in the case of 
<xref topicid="358539" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Maimonides</xref>
’ 
<e>The Guide for the Perplexed</e>
). Nonetheless, Islam too was understood to contribute to the fulfillment of the divine purpose. From the late medieval period onward, the intellectual engagement between the two religions diminished with the general decline in the Turkish empire that then embraced the Muslim world. In modern times it has not yet been renewed for many reasons, the most important of which has been the political and military conflict between the 
<xref topicid="296740" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">State of Israel</xref>
and the Arab countries of the Middle East.

-<h4 tocid="35372">

<headtitle>Relations with other religions</headtitle>


-<p>
Judaism’s encounters with religions other than Christianity and Islam have been in large measure limited to the past. In the Hellenistic world, it confronted and rejected the varieties of syncretistic cults that grew up. Within the Sāsānian empire it was forced to deal with 
<xref topicid="658081" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1621466">Zoroastrianism</xref>
, but the outlines of its response have not yet been entirely disentangled from the literature of the period. In the modern world, particularly in the most recent period, it has come face to face with the religions of the Middle East and Asia, but beyond a few tentative explorations nothing tangible has appeared. Because of the growing interest and exchange between East and West, however, Jewish thinkers will not be able to rest with older formulations concerning the nature of other religious systems. Without compromising its own faith or falling into an uncritical relativism, Judaism may indeed seek a new way of understanding and relating to the varieties of religious systems facing it on the world scene.

<headtitle>The role of Judaism in Western culture and civilization</headtitle>


-<h4 tocid="35374">

<headtitle>Its historic role</headtitle>


-<p>
Judaism has played a significant role in the development of Western culture because of its unique relationship with Christianity, the dominant religious force in the West. Although the Christian church drew from other sources as well, its retention of the sacred Scriptures of the synagogue (the 
<xref topicid="427211" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Old Testament</xref>
) as an integral part of its Bible—a decision sharply debated in the 2nd century 
<e ty="s">ce</e>
—was crucial. Not only was the development of its ideas and doctrines deeply influenced, but it also received an ethical dynamism that constantly overcame an inclination to withdraw into world-denying isolation. 
</p>


-<p>
It was, however, not only Judaism’s heritage but its persistence that touched Western civilization. The continuing existence of the Jews, even as a pariah people, was both a challenge and a warning. Their liberation from the shackles of discrimination, segregation, and rejection at the beginning of the modern era was understood by many to be the touchstone of all human liberty. Until the final ghettoization of the Jew—it is well to remember that the term 
<e>ghetto</e>
belongs in the first instance to Jewish history—at the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance, intellectual contact between Judaism and Christianity, and thus between Judaism and Western culture, continued. St. Jerome translated the 
<xref topicid="259039" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Hebrew Bible</xref>
into Latin with the aid of Jewish scholars; the exegetical work of the scholars of the monastery of St. Victor in the 12th century borrowed heavily from Jewish scholars; and the biblical commentary of Rashi (
<xref topicid="491673" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes</xref>
) was an important source for 
<xref topicid="351950" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1639479">Martin Luther</xref>
(1483–1546). Jewish thinkers helped to bring the remarkable intellectual achievements of the Islamic world to Christian Europe and added their own contributions as well. Even heresies within the church, on occasion, were said to have been inspired by or modeled after Judaism. 
</p>

</h4>


-<h4 tocid="35375">

<headtitle>Its present role</headtitle>

<p>In the modern world, while the influence of Jews has increased in almost every realm of cultural life, the impact of Judaism itself has diminished. The reason for this is not difficult to find. The Gentile leaders who extended emancipation to the Jews at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th were eager to grant political equality, but they also insisted that certain reforms of Judaism be accepted. With the transformation of Judaism into an ecclesiastical institution, largely on the model of German Protestant churches, its ideas and structures took on the cast of its environment in a way quite unlike what had ensued in its earlier confrontations with various philosophical systems. Indeed, for some, Judaism and 19th-century European thought were not merely congruent but identical. Thus, while numerous contributors to diverse aspects of Western culture and civilization are to be found among Jews of the 20th and 21st centuries—scientists, politicians, statesmen, scholars, musicians, artists—their activities cannot, except in specific instances, be considered as deriving from Judaism as it has been sketched above.</p>

<headtitle>Future prospects</headtitle>


-<p>
The two central events of 20th-century Jewish history were the 
<xref topicid="269548" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1810000">Holocaust</xref>
and the establishment of the State of Israel. The former was the great tragedy of the Jewish people, while the latter was the light of a rebirth, which promised political, cultural, and economic independence. The rest of the world has been forced to reconsider and reorient its relationship with Judaism and the Jewish people because of these two events. At the same time, the centres of Jewish life have moved almost exclusively to Israel and 
<xref topicid="418612" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">North America</xref>
. The virtual absence of official 
<xref topicid="27646" tocid="" ty="1" refid="1810001">anti-Semitism</xref>
in North America allowed Jews to flourish in pursuits previously the preserve of Gentiles. Along with these developments, theological considerations and practical realities, such as interfaith marriage, have made Jewish religious culture a point of interest for many non-Jews. 
</p>


-<p>
In the early 21st century, Jewish religious life continued to fragment along ideological lines, but that very fragmentation animated both moral imagination and ritual life. While ultra-Orthodox Judaism grew more insular, and some varieties of 
<xref topicid="495370" tocid="" ty="1" refid="0">Liberal Judaism</xref>
moved ritual practice even farther away from traditional observance, a vital centre emerged, running from Reform Judaism to modern Orthodoxy. This centre sought to understand Judaism within a broader context of interaction with other cultures while leaving unaffected the essentials of belief and practice. Predicting the future of Judaism is not an easy or enviable task, but there is reason to hope that the world will continue to draw upon the religious and cultural traditions of Judaism, both past and present.

          Rome must be considered one of the most successful imperial powers in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267505" tocid="">history</xref>. In the course of centuries Rome grew from a small town on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="594854" tocid="">Tiber River</xref> in central <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="297474" tocid="">Italy</xref> into a vast empire that ultimately embraced England, all of continental <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="195896" tocid="">Europe</xref> west of the Rhine and south of the Danube, most of Asia west of the Euphrates, northern Africa, and the islands of the Mediterranean. Unlike the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244231" tocid="">Greeks</xref>, who excelled in intellectual and artistic endeavours, the Romans achieved greatness in their military, political, and social institutions. Roman society, during the republic, was governed by a strong military <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194337" tocid="">ethos</xref>. While this helps to explain the incessant warfare, it does not account for Rome’s success as an imperial power. Unlike Greek city-states, which excluded foreigners and subjected peoples from political participation, Rome from its beginning incorporated conquered peoples into its social and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="467746" tocid="">political system</xref>. Allies and subjects who adopted Roman ways were eventually granted Roman citizenship. During the principate (see below), the seats in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="534333" tocid="">Senate</xref> and even the imperial throne were occupied by persons from the Mediterranean realm outside Italy. The lasting effects of Roman rule in Europe can be seen in the geographic distribution of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508379" tocid="">Romance languages</xref> (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian), all of which evolved from Latin, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="329791" tocid="">language</xref> of the Romans. The Western alphabet of 26 letters and the calendar of 12 months and 365.25 days are only two simple examples of the cultural legacy which Rome has bequeathed Western civilization.

                When Italy emerged into the light of history about 700 <e ty="s">bc</e>, it was already inhabited by various peoples of different cultures and languages. Most natives of the country lived in villages or small towns, supported themselves by agriculture or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="25739" tocid="">animal husbandry</xref> (Italia means “Calf Land”), and spoke an Italic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="161156" tocid="">dialect</xref> belonging to the Indo-European <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="201237" tocid="">family</xref> of languages. Oscan and Umbrian were closely related Italic dialects spoken by the inhabitants of the Apennines. The other two Italic dialects, Latin and Venetic, were likewise closely related to each other and were spoken, respectively, by the Latins of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="332009" tocid="">Latium</xref> (a plain of west-central Italy) and the people of northeastern Italy (near modern Venice). Iapyges and Messapii inhabited the southeastern coast. Their language resembled the speech of the Illyrians on the other side of the Adriatic. During the 5th century <e ty="s">bc</e> the Po valley of northern Italy (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118628" tocid="">Cisalpine Gaul</xref>) was occupied by Gallic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="604708" tocid="">tribes</xref> who spoke Celtic and who had migrated across the Alps from continental Europe. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194586" tocid="">Etruscans</xref> were the first highly civilized people of Italy and were the only inhabitants who did not speak an Indo-European language. By 700 <e ty="s">bc</e> several Greek colonies were established along the southern coast. Both Greeks and Phoenicians were actively engaged in trade with the Italian natives.

                Modern historical analysis is making rapid progress in showing how Rome’s early development occurred in a multicultural environment and was particularly influenced by the higher civilizations of the Etruscans to the north and the Greeks to the south. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">Roman religion</xref> was indebted to the beliefs and practices of the Etruscans. The Romans borrowed and adapted the alphabet from the Etruscans, who in turn had borrowed and adapted it from the Greek colonies of Italy. Senior officials of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="857952" tocid="">Roman Republic</xref> derived their insignia from the Etruscans: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="147227" tocid="">curule chair</xref>, purple-bordered toga (<e>toga praetexta</e>), and bundle of rods (<e>

Rome lay 12 miles inland from the sea on the Tiber River, the border between Latium and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194570" tocid="">Etruria</xref>. Because the site commanded a convenient river crossing and lay on a land route from the Apennines to the sea, it formed the meeting point of three distinct peoples: Latins, Etruscans, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515068" tocid="">Sabines</xref>. Though Latin in speech and culture, the Roman population must have been somewhat diverse from earliest times, a circumstance that may help to account for the openness of Roman society in historical times.

              <p>
                The regal period (753–509 <e ty="s">bc</e>) and the early republic (509–280 <e ty="s">bc</e>) are the most poorly documented periods of Roman history because historical accounts of Rome were not written until much later. Greek historians did not take serious notice of Rome until the Pyrrhic War (280–275 <e ty="s">bc</e>), when Rome was completing its conquest of Italy and was fighting against the Greek city of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="583349" tocid="">Tarentum</xref> in southern Italy. Rome’s first native historian, a senator named <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="199711" tocid="">Quintus Fabius Pictor</xref>, lived and wrote even later, during the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483518" tocid="">Second Punic War</xref> (218–201 <e ty="s">bc</e>). Thus historical writing at Rome did not begin until after Rome had completed its conquest of Italy, had emerged as a major power of the ancient world, and was engaged in a titanic struggle with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="97373" tocid="">Carthage</xref> for control of the western Mediterranean. Fabius Pictor’s history, which began with the city’s mythical Trojan ancestry and narrated events up to his own day, established the form of subsequent histories of Rome. During the last 200 years <e ty="s">bc</e>, 16 other Romans wrote similarly inclusive narratives. All these works are now collectively termed “the Roman <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="26143" tocid="">annalistic</xref> tradition” because many of them attempted to give a year-by-year (or annalistic) account of Roman affairs for the republic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although none of these histories are fully preserved, the first 10 books of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="344974" tocid="">Livy</xref>, one of Rome’s greatest historians, are extant and cover Roman affairs from earliest times down to the year 293 <e ty="s">bc</e> (extant are also Books 21 to 45 treating the events from 218 <e ty="s">bc</e> to 167 <e ty="s">bc</e>). Since <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="344974" tocid="">Livy</xref> wrote during the reign of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="186034" tocid="">emperor</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43047" tocid="">Augustus</xref> (27 <e ty="s">bc</e>–<e ty="s">ad</e> 14), he was separated by 200 years from Fabius Pictor, who, in turn, had lived long after many of the events his history described. Thus, in writing about early Rome, ancient historians were confronted with great difficulties in ascertaining the truth. They possessed a list of annual magistrates from the beginning of the republic onward (the consular <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="202337" tocid="">fasti</xref>
                </e>), which formed the chronological framework of their accounts. Religious records and the texts of some laws and treaties provided a bare outline of major events. Ancient historians fleshed out this meagre factual material with both native and Greek folklore. Consequently, over time, historical facts about early Rome often suffered from patriotic or face-saving reinterpretations involving exaggeration of the truth, suppression of embarrassing facts, and invention.
              </p>
              <p>
                The evidence for the annalistic tradition shows that the Roman histories written during the 2nd century <e ty="s">bc</e> were relatively brief resumes of facts and stories. Yet in the course of the 1st century <e ty="s">bc</e> Roman writers were increasingly influenced by Greek rhetorical training, with the result that their histories became greatly expanded in length; included in them were fictitious speeches and lengthy narratives of spurious battles and political confrontations, which, however, reflect the military and political conditions and controversies of the late republic rather than accurately portraying the events of early Rome. Livy’s history of early Rome, for example, is a blend of some facts and much fiction. Since it is often difficult to separate fact from fiction in his works and doing so involves personal judgment, modern scholars have disagreed about many aspects of early Roman history and will continue to do so.

              <headtitle>Rome’s foundation myth</headtitle>
              <p>
                Although Greek historians did not write seriously about Rome until the Pyrrhic War, they were aware of Rome’s existence long before then. In accordance with their custom of explaining the origin of the foreign peoples they encountered by connecting them with the wanderings of one of their own mythical heroes, such as Jason and the Argonauts, Heracles, or Odysseus, Greek writers from the 5th century <e ty="s">bc</e> onward invented at least 25 different myths to account for Rome’s foundation. In one of the earliest accounts (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="260263" tocid="">Hellanicus of Lesbos</xref>), which became accepted, the Trojan hero <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="7113" tocid="">Aeneas</xref> and some followers escaped the Greek destruction of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606871" tocid="">Troy;</xref> after wandering about the Mediterranean for some years, they settled in central Italy, where they intermarried with the native population and became the Latins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the connection between Rome and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606871" tocid="">Troy</xref> is unhistorical, the Romans of later time were so flattered by this illustrious mythical pedigree that they readily accepted it and incorporated it into their own folklore about the beginning of their city. Roman historians knew that the republic had begun about 500 <e ty="s">bc</e>, because their annual list of magistrates went back that far. Before that time, they thought, Rome had been ruled by seven kings in succession. By using Greek methods of genealogical reckoning, they estimated that seven kings would have ruled about 250 years, thus making Rome’s regal period begin in the middle of the 8th century <e ty="s">bc</e>. Ancient historians initially differed concerning the precise date of Rome’s foundation, ranging from as early as 814 <e ty="s">bc</e> (Timaeus) to as late as 728 <e ty="s">bc</e> (Cincius Alimentus). By the end of the republic, it was generally accepted that Rome had been founded in 753 <e ty="s">bc</e> and that the republic had begun in 509 <e ty="s">bc</e>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the generally accepted date of Troy’s destruction was 1184 <e ty="s">bc</e>, Roman historians maintained Troy’s unhistorical connection with Rome by inventing a series of fictitious kings who were supposed to have descended from the Trojan <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="7113" tocid="">Aeneas</xref> and ruled the Latin town of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="12446" tocid="">Alba Longa</xref> for the intervening 431 years (1184–753 <e ty="s">bc</e>) until the last of the royal line, the twin brothers <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="509038" tocid="">Romulus and Remus</xref>, founded their own city, Rome, on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439237" tocid="">Palatine Hill</xref>. According to tradition, the twins, believed to have been the children of the god <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="366325" tocid="">Mars</xref>, were set adrift in a basket on the Tiber by the king of Alba; they survived, however, being nursed by a she-wolf, and lived to overthrow the wicked king. In the course of founding Rome the brothers quarreled, and Romulus slew Remus. This story was a Roman adaptation of a widespread ancient Mediterranean folktale told of many national leaders, such as the Akkadian king Sargon (<e>c.</e> 2300 <e ty="s">bc</e>), the biblical Moses, the Persian king <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="148758" tocid="">Cyrus the Great</xref>, the Theban king Oedipus, and the twins Neleus and Pelias of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244670" tocid="">Greek mythology</xref>.

                Romulus, Rome’s first king according to tradition, was the invention of later ancient historians. His name, which is not even proper Latin, was designed to explain the origin of Rome’s name. His fictitious reign was filled with deeds expected of an ancient city founder and the son of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="635532" tocid="">war</xref> god. Thus he was described as having established Rome’s early political, military, and social institutions and as having waged war against neighbouring states. Romulus was also thought to have shared his royal power for a time with a Sabine named <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="597391" tocid="">Titus Tatius</xref>. The name may be that of an authentic ruler of early Rome, perhaps Rome’s first real king; nothing, however, was known about him in later centuries, and his reign was therefore lumped together with that of Romulus.
              </p>
              <p>The names of the other six kings are authentic and were remembered by the Romans, but few reliable details were known about their reigns. However, since the later Romans wished to have explanations for their early customs and institutions, historians ascribed various innovations to these kings, often in stereotypical and erroneous ways. The three kings after Romulus are still hardly more than names, but the recorded deeds of the last three kings are more historical and can, to some extent, be checked by archaeological evidence.</p>
              <p>
                According to ancient tradition, the warlike founder Romulus was succeeded by the Sabine <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422258" tocid="">Numa Pompilius</xref>, whose reign was characterized by complete tranquility and peace. Numa was supposed to have created virtually all of Rome’s religious institutions and practices. The tradition of his religiosity probably derives from the erroneous connection by the ancients of his name with the Latin word <e>numen</e>, meaning divine power. Numa was succeeded by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="608702" tocid="">Tullus Hostilius</xref>, whose reign was filled with warlike exploits, probably because the name Hostilius was later interpreted to suggest hostility and belligerence. Tullus was followed by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="23413" tocid="">Ancus Marcius</xref>, who was believed to have been the grandson of Numa. His reign combined the characteristics of those of his two predecessors—namely religious innovations as well as warfare.

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32572" tocid="">Archaeological evidence</xref> for early Rome is scattered and limited because it has proven difficult to conduct extensive excavations at sites still occupied by later buildings. What evidence exists is often ambiguous and cannot be correlated easily to the ancient literary tradition; it can, however, sometimes confirm or contradict aspects of the ancient historical account. For example, it confirms that the earliest settlement was a simple village of thatched huts on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439237" tocid="">Palatine Hill</xref> (one of the seven hills eventually occupied by the city of Rome), but it dates the beginning of the village to the 10th or 9th century <e ty="s">bc</e>, not the mid-8th century. Rome therefore cannot have been ruled by a succession of only seven kings down to the end of the 6th century <e ty="s">bc</e>. Archaeology also shows that the Esquiline Hill was next inhabited, thus disproving the ancient account which maintained that the Quirinal Hill was settled after the Palatine. Around 670–660 <e ty="s">bc</e> the Palatine settlement expanded down into the valley of the later <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507743" tocid="">Forum Romanum</xref> and became a town of artisans living in houses with stone foundations. The material culture testifies to the existence of some trade as well as to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194586" tocid="">Etruscan</xref> and Greek influence. Archaeology of other Latin sites suggests that Rome at this time was a typical Latin community. In another major transition spanning the 6th century the Latin town was gradually transformed into a real city. The swampy Forum valley was drained and paved to become the city’s public centre. There are clear signs of major temple construction. Pottery and architectural remains indicate vigorous trade with the Greeks and Etruscans, as well as local work done under their influence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rome’s urban transformation was carried out by its last three kings: Lucius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="583666" tocid="">Tarquinius</xref> Priscus (Tarquin the Elder), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536028" tocid="">Servius Tullius</xref>, and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="583670" tocid="">Tarquin</xref> the Proud). According to ancient tradition, the two Tarquins were father and son and came from Etruria. One tradition made <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536028" tocid="">Servius Tullius</xref> a Latin; another described him as an Etruscan named Mastarna. All three kings were supposed to have been great city planners and organizers (a tradition that has been confirmed by archaeology). Their Etruscan origin is rendered plausible by Rome’s proximity to Etruria, Rome’s growing geographic significance, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482523" tocid="">public works</xref> that were carried out by the kings themselves. The latter were characteristic of contemporary Etruscan cities. It would thus appear that during the 6th century <e ty="s">bc</e> some Etruscan adventurers took over the site of Rome and transformed it into a city along Etruscan lines.

              <p>
                The ancient historians depicted Rome’s first six kings as benevolent and just rulers but the last one as a cruel tyrant who murdered his predecessor Servius Tullius, usurped the kingship, terrorized the Senate, and oppressed the common people with public works. He supposedly was overthrown by a popular uprising ignited by the rape of a virtuous noblewoman, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350678" tocid="">Lucretia</xref>, by the king’s son. The reign of Tarquinius Superbus was described in the stereotypical terms of a Greek tyranny in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="431390" tocid="">order</xref> to explain the major political transition from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="388855" tocid="">monarchy</xref> to the republic in accordance with Greek political theory concerning constitutional evolution from monarchy to tyranny to aristocracy. This explanation provided later Romans with a satisfying patriotic story of despotism giving way to liberty; it is probably unhistorical, however, and merely a Roman adaptation of a well-known Greek story of a love affair in Athens that led to the murder of the tyrant’s brother and the tyrant’s eventual downfall. According to ancient tradition, as soon as the Romans had expelled their last tyrannical king, the king of the Etruscan city of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, attacked and besieged Rome. The city was gallantly defended by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="271671" tocid="">Horatius Cocles</xref>, who sacrificed his life in defense of the bridge across the Tiber, and Mucius Scaecvola, who attempted to assassinate Porsenna in his own camp. When arrested before accomplishing the deed, he demonstrated his courage by voluntarily burning off his right hand in a nearby fire. As a result of such Roman heroism, Porsenna was supposed to have made peace with Rome and withdrawn his army.
              </p>
              <p>
                One prevalent modern view is that the monarchy at Rome was incidentally terminated through military defeat and foreign intervention. This theory sees Rome as a site highly prized by the Etruscans of the 6th century <e ty="s">bc</e>, who are known to have extended their power and influence at the time across the Tiber into Latium and even farther south into Campania. Toward the end of the 6th century, Rome may have been involved in a war against King Porsenna of Clusium, who defeated the Romans, seized the city, and expelled its last king. Before Porsenna could establish himself as monarch, he was forced to withdraw, leaving Rome kingless. In fact, Porsenna is known to have suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the combined forces of the other Latins and the Greeks of Campanian Cumae. Rather than restoring <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="583666" tocid="">Tarquin</xref> from exile to power, the Romans replaced the kingship with two annually elected magistrates called consuls.

              <headtitle>The struggle of the orders</headtitle>
              <p>
                As the Roman state grew in size and power during the early republic (509–280 <e ty="s">bc</e>), new offices and institutions were created, and old ones were adapted to cope with the changing military, political, social, and economic needs of the state and its populace. According to the annalistic tradition, all these changes and innovations resulted from a political struggle between two <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social orders</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446617" tocid="">patricians</xref> and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="464495" tocid="">plebeians</xref>, that is thought to have begun during the first years of the republic and lasted for more than 200 years. In the beginning, the patricians were supposed to have enjoyed a monopoly of power (the consulship, the Senate, and all religious offices), whereas the plebeians began with nothing except the right to vote in the assemblies. During the course of the struggle the plebeians, however, were believed to have won concessions gradually from the patricians through political agitation and confrontation, and they eventually attained legal equality with them. Thus ancient historians, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="344974" tocid="">Livy</xref>, explained all aspects of early Rome’s internal political development in terms of a single sustained <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551335" tocid="">social movement</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As tradition has it, the distinction between patricians and plebeians was as old as Rome itself and had been instituted by Romulus. The actual historical dating and explanation of this distinction still constitutes the single biggest unsolved problem of early Roman history. The distinction existed during the middle and late republic, but modern scholars do not agree on when or how it arose; they are increasingly inclined to think that it originated and evolved slowly during the early republic. By the time of the middle and late republic, it was largely meaningless. At that point only about one dozen Roman families were <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446617" tocid="">patrician</xref>, all others being <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="464495" tocid="">plebeian</xref>. Both patrician and plebeian families made up the nobility, which consisted simply of all descendants of consuls. The term “patrician,” therefore, was not synonymous with “noble” and should not be confused with it: the patricians formed only a part of the Roman nobility of the middle and late republic. The only difference between patricians and plebeians in later times was that each group was either entitled to or debarred from holding certain minor offices.

                The discrepancies, inconsistencies, and logical fallacies in Livy’s account of the early republic make it evident that the annalistic tradition’s thesis of a struggle of the orders is a gross oversimplification of a highly complex series of events that had no single cause. Tensions certainly existed; no state can experience 200 years of history without some degree of social conflict and economic unrest. In fact, legal sources indicate that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="332745" tocid="">law</xref> of debt in early Rome was extremely harsh and must have sometimes created much hardship. Yet it is impossible to believe that all aspects of early Rome’s internal political development resulted from one cause. Early documents, if available, would have told the later annalistic historians little more than that a certain office had been created or some law passed. An explanation of causality could have been supplied only by folklore or by the imagination of the historian himself, neither of which can be relied upon. Livy’s descriptions of early republican political crises evince the political <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501179" tocid="">rhetoric</xref> and tactics of the late republic and therefore cannot be given credence without justification. For example, early republican agrarian legislation is narrated in late republican terms. Early republican conflicts between plebeian tribunes and the Senate are likewise patterned after the politics of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="430565" tocid="">Optimates and Populares</xref> of the late republic. Caution therefore must be exercised in examining early Rome’s internal development. Many of the major innovations recorded in the ancient tradition can be accepted, but the ancient interpretation of these facts cannot go unchallenged.

                The later Romans viewed the abolition of the kingship and its replacement by the consulship as marking the beginning of the republic.

They were always regarded as the chief magistrates of the republic, so much so that the names of each pair were given to their year of office for purposes of dating. Thus careful records were kept of these names, which later formed the chronological basis for ancient histories of the republic. The consuls were primarily generals who led Rome’s armies in war. They were therefore elected by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127673" tocid="">centuriate assembly</xref>—that is, the Roman army organized into a voting body. The two consuls possessed equal power. Such <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="125666" tocid="">collegiality</xref> was basic to almost all Roman public offices; it served to check abuses of power because one magistrate’s actions could be obstructed by his colleague.

All consuls before that time were thought to have been patrician, and one major aspect of the struggle of the orders was supposed to have been the plebeians’ persistent agitation to make the office open to them. However, if the classification of patrician and plebeian names known for the middle and late republic is applied to the consular list for the years 509–445 <e ty="s">bc</e>, plebeian names are well represented (30 percent). It is likely that there never was a prohibition against plebeians holding the consulship. The distinction between patrician and plebeian families may have become fixed only by the middle of the 4th century <e ty="s">bc</e>; and the law of that time (367 <e ty="s">bc</e>), which specified that one of the consuls was to be plebeian, may have done nothing more than to guarantee legally that both groups of the nobility would have an equal share in the state’s highest office.

                Despite the advantages of consular collegiality, in military emergencies unity of command was sometimes necessary.

The dictator held supreme military command for no longer than six months. He was also termed the master of the army (<e>magister populi</e>), and he appointed a subordinate cavalry commander, the master of horse (<e>magister equitum</e>). The office was thoroughly constitutional and should not be confused with the late republican dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar, which were simply legalizations of autocratic power obtained through military usurpation.

Its members were collectively termed <e>patres et conscripti</e> (“the fathers and the enrolled”), suggesting that the Senate was initially composed of two different groups. Since the term “patrician” was derived from <e>patres</e> and seems to have originally meant “a member of the <e>patres</e>,” the dichotomy probably somehow involved the distinction between patricians and plebeians.

                During the republic the Senate advised both magistrates and the Roman people. Although in theory the people were sovereign (see below) and the Senate only offered advice, in actual practice the Senate wielded enormous power because of the collective prestige of its members. It was by far the most important deliberative body in the Roman state, summoned into session by a magistrate who submitted matters to it for discussion and debate. Whatever a majority voted in favour of was termed “the Senate’s advice” (<e>senatus consultum</e>). These advisory decrees were directed to a magistrate or the Roman people. In most instances, they were either implemented by a magistrate or submitted by him to the people for enactment into law.

              <p>
                The centuriate assembly evolved through different stages during the early republic, but information exists only about its final organization. It may have begun as the citizen army meeting under arms to elect its commander and to decide on war or peace. During historical times the assembly had a complex organization. All voting citizens were placed into one of five economic classes according to wealth. Each class was allotted varying numbers of centuries, and the entire assembly consisted of 193 units. The first (and richest) class of citizens was distributed among 80 centuries; the second, third, and fourth classes were each assigned 20 units. The fifth class, comprising the poorest persons in the army, was allotted 30 centuries. In addition, there were 18 centuries of knights—men wealthy enough to afford a horse for cavalry service—and five other centuries, one of which comprised the <e>proletarii</e>, or landless people too poor to serve in the army. The knights voted together with the first class, and voting proceeded from richest to poorest. Because the knights and the first class controlled 98 units, they were the dominant group in the assembly, though they constituted the smallest portion of the citizen body. The assembly was deliberately designed to give the greater authority to the wealthier element and was responsible for maintaining the political supremacy of the established nobility.

It accordingly met within the city inside the pomerium and elected magistrates who did not exercise imperium (plebeian tribunes, plebeian aediles, and quaestors). It did most of the legislating and sat as a court for serious public offenses involving monetary fines.

                The tribal assembly was more democratic in its organization than the centuriate assembly. The territory of the Roman state was divided into geographic districts called tribes, and people voted in these units according to residence. The city was divided into four urban tribes. During the 5th century <e ty="s">bc</e>, the surrounding countryside formed 17 rustic tribes. With the expansion of Roman territory in central Italy (387–241 <e ty="s">bc</e>), 14 rustic tribes were added, thus gradually increasing the assembly to 35 units, a number never exceeded.

              <p>
                According to the annalistic tradition, one of the most important events in the struggle of the orders was the creation of the plebeian tribunate. After being worn down by military service, bad economic conditions, and the rigours of early Rome’s debt law, the plebeians in 494 <e ty="s">bc</e> seceded in a body from the city to the Sacred Mount, located three miles from Rome. There they pitched camp and elected their own officials for their future protection. Because the state was threatened with an enemy attack, the Senate was forced to allow the plebeians to have their own officials, the tribunes of the plebs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially there were only 2 tribunes of the plebs, but their number increased to 5 in 471 <e ty="s">bc</e> and to 10 in 457 <e ty="s">bc</e>. They had no insignia of office, like the consuls, but they were regarded as sacrosanct. Whoever physically harmed them could be killed with impunity. They had the right to intercede on a citizen’s behalf against the action of a consul, but their powers were valid only within one mile from the pomerium. They convoked the tribal assembly and submitted bills to it for legislation. Tribunes prosecuted other magistrates before the assembled people for misconduct in office. They could also veto the action of another <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="604799" tocid="">tribune</xref> (<e>veto</e> meaning “I forbid”). Two plebeian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6946" tocid="">aediles</xref> served as their assistants in managing the affairs of the city. Although they were thought of as the champions of the people, persons elected to this office came from aristocratic families and generally favoured the status quo. Nevertheless, the office could be and sometimes was used by young aspiring aristocrats to make a name for themselves by taking up populist causes in opposition to the nobility.

                Modern scholars disagree about the authenticity of the annalistic account concerning the plebs’ first secession and the creation of the plebeian tribunate. The tradition presented this as the first of three secessions, the other two allegedly occurring in 449 and 287 <e ty="s">bc</e>. The second secession is clearly fictitious. Many scholars regard the first one as a later annalistic invention as well, accepting only the last one as historical. Although the first secession is explained in terms resembling the conditions of the later Gracchan agrarian crisis (see below <xref refid="19999" ty="3" topicid="507905" tocid="26627">

However, the urban-civilian character of the plebeian tribunate complements the extra-urban military nature of the consulship so nicely that the two offices may have originally been designed to function cooperatively to satisfy the needs of the state rather than to be antagonistic to one another.

              <p>
                The next major episode after the creation of the plebeian tribunate in the annalistic version of the struggle of the orders involved the first systematic codification of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref>. The plebeians were supposed to have desired a written law code in which consular imperium would be circumscribed to guard against abuses. After years of tribunician agitation the Senate finally agreed. A special board of 10 men (<e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="155038" tocid="">decemviri</xref>
                </e>) was appointed for 451 <e ty="s">bc</e> to draw up a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="332806" tocid="">law code</xref>. Since their task was not done after one year, a second board of 10 was appointed to finish the job, but they became tyrannical and stayed in office beyond their time. They were finally forced out of power when one commissioner’s cruel lust for an innocent maiden named Verginia so outraged the people that they seceded for a second time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The law code was inscribed upon 12 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="81000" tocid="">bronze</xref> tablets and publicly displayed in the Forum. Its provisions concerned <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477661" tocid="">legal procedure</xref>, debt foreclosure, paternal authority over children, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479032" tocid="">property rights</xref>, inheritance, funerary regulations, and various major and minor offenses.

                Because the law code seems not to have had any specific provisions concerning consular imperium, the annalistic explanation for the codification appears suspect. The story of the second tyrannical board of 10 is an annalistic invention patterned after the 30 tyrants of Athenian history. The tale of Verginia is likewise modeled after the story of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350678" tocid="">Lucretia</xref> and the overthrow of Rome’s last king. Thus the second secession, which is an integral part of the story, cannot be regarded as historical. On the basis of existing evidence, one cannot say whether the law code resulted from any social or economic causes. Rome was a growing city and may simply have been in need of a systematic body of law.

              <p>
                The creation of the office of military tribunes with consular power in 445 <e ty="s">bc</e> was believed to have involved the struggle of the orders. The annalistic tradition portrayed the innovation as resulting from a political compromise between plebeian tribunes, demanding access to the consulship, and the Senate, trying to maintain the patrician monopoly of the office. Henceforth, each year the people were to decide whether to elect two patrician consuls or military tribunes with consular power who could be patricians or plebeians. The list of magistrates for 444 to 367 <e ty="s">bc</e> shows that the chief magistracy alternated between consuls and military tribunes. Consuls were more frequently elected down to 426 but rarely thereafter. At first there were three military tribunes, but the number increased to four in 426, and to six in 406. The consular tribunate was abolished in 367 <e ty="s">bc</e> and replaced by the consulship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Livy indicates that according to some sources the consular tribunate was created because Rome was faced with three wars simultaneously. Because there is evidence that there was no prohibition against plebeians becoming consuls, scholars have suggested that the reason for the innovation was the growing military and administrative needs of the Roman state; this view is corroborated by other data. Beginning in 447 <e ty="s">bc</e> two <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="485995" tocid="">quaestors</xref> were elected as financial officials of the consuls, and the number increased to four in 421 <e ty="s">bc</e>.

They drew up official lists of Roman citizens, assessed the value of their property, and assigned them to their proper tribe and century within the tribal and centuriate assemblies. The increase in the number of military tribunes coincided with Rome’s first two major wars, against Fidenae and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624685" tocid="">Veii</xref>. In 366 <e ty="s">bc</e> six undifferentiated military tribunes were replaced with five magistrates that had specific functions: two consuls for conducting wars, an urban <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473655" tocid="">praetor</xref> who handled lawsuits in Rome, and two curule aediles who managed various affairs in the city. In 362 <e ty="s">bc</e> the Romans began to elect annually six military tribunes as subordinate officers of the consuls.

              <p>
                The law reinstating the consulship was one of three tribunician bills, the so-called Licinio-Sextian Rogations of 367 <e ty="s">bc</e>. Another forbade citizens to rent more than 500 <e>iugera</e> (330 acres) of public land, and the third provided for the alleviation of indebtedness. The historicity of the second bill has often been questioned, but the great increase in the size of Roman territory resulting from Rome’s conquest of Veii renders this law plausible. The law concerning indebtedness is probably historical as well, since other data suggest that debt was a problem in mid-4th-century Rome. In 352 <e ty="s">bc</e> a five-man commission was appointed to extend public credit in order to reduce private indebtedness. A Genucian law of 342 <e ty="s">bc</e> (named after Genucius, tribune of that year) temporarily suspended the charging of interest on loans. In 326 or 313 <e ty="s">bc</e> a Poetelian law ameliorated the harsh conditions of the Twelve Tables regarding debt servitude by outlawing the use of chains to confine debt bondsmen.
              </p>
              <p>Rome’s economic advancement is reflected in its replacement of a cumbersome bronze currency with silver coinage adopted from the Greek states of southern Italy, the so-called Romano-Campanian didrachms. The date of this innovation is disputed. Modern estimates range from the First Samnite War to the Pyrrhic War. Rome was no longer a small town of central Italy but rather was quickly becoming the master of the Italian peninsula and was taking its place in the larger Mediterranean world.</p>
              <p>
                The process of expansion is well illustrated by innovations in Roman private law about 300 <e ty="s">bc</e>. Since legal business could be conducted only on certain days (<e>dies fasti</e>), knowledge of the calendar was important for litigation. In early times the <e>rex sacrorum</e> at the beginning of each month orally proclaimed in Rome before the assembled people the official calendar for that month. Though suited for a small agricultural community, this parochial procedure became increasingly unsuitable as Roman territory grew and more citizens lived farther from Rome. In 304 <e ty="s">bc</e> a curule aedile named <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="209800" tocid="">Gnaeus Flavius</xref> upset conservative opinion but performed a great <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119404" tocid="">public service</xref> by erecting an inscription of the calendar in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507743" tocid="">Roman Forum</xref> for permanent display. From early times, Roman private law and legal procedure had largely been controlled and developed by the priesthood of pontiffs. In 300 <e ty="s">bc</e> the Ogulnian law (after the tribunes Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius) ended the patrician monopoly of two priestly colleges by increasing the number of pontiffs from four to eight and the number of augurs from four to nine and by specifying that the new priests were to be plebeian.

              <p>
                In 287 <e ty="s">bc</e> the third (and perhaps the only historical) secession of the plebs occurred. Since Livy’s account has not survived, detailed knowledge about this event is lacking. One source suggests that debt caused the secession. Many sources state that the crisis was ended by the passage of the Hortensian law (after <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="272473" tocid="">Quintus Hortensius</xref>, dictator for 287), which was thought to have given enactments of the tribal assembly the same force as resolutions of the centuriate assembly. However, since similar measures were supposed to have been enacted in 449 and 339 <e ty="s">bc</e>, doubt persists about the meaning of these laws. It is possible that no difference ever existed in the degree of legal authority of the two assemblies. The three laws could be annalistic misinterpretations of a provision of the Twelve Tables specifying that what the people decided last should be binding. One source indicates that the Hortensian law made all assembly days eligible for legal business. If debt played a role in the secession, the Hortensian law may have been designed to reduce the backlog of lawsuits in the praetor’s court in Rome.

Although the Latin states occasionally waged war among themselves, in times of common danger they banded together for mutual defense. Each state contributed military forces according to its strength.

Sometimes the Latins even founded colonies upon hostile territory as military outposts, which became new, independent Latin states, enjoying the same rights as all the other ones. Modern scholars use the term “Latin League” to describe this collection of rights and duties.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to ancient tradition, Rome’s last three kings not only transformed Rome into a real city but also made it the leader of the Latin League. There is probably exaggeration in this claim. Roman historians were eager to portray early Rome as destined for future greatness and as more powerful than it actually was. Rome certainly became one of the more important states in Latium during the 6th century, but Tibur, Praeneste, and Tusculum were equally important and long remained so. By the terms of the first <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="603884" tocid="">treaty</xref> between Rome and Carthage (509 <e ty="s">bc</e>), recorded by the Greek historian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="468317" tocid="">Polybius</xref> (<e>c.</e> 150 <e ty="s">bc</e>), the Romans (or perhaps more accurately, the Latins generally) claimed a coastal strip 70 miles south of the Tiber River as their sphere of influence not to be encroached upon by the Carthaginians.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rome’s rapid rise during the 6th century was the achievement of its Etruscan overlords, and the city quickly declined with the collapse of Etruscan power in Campania and Latium about 500 <e ty="s">bc</e>. Immediately after the fall of the Roman monarchy, amid Porsenna’s conquest of Rome, his defeat by the Latins, and his subsequent withdrawal, the plain of Latium began to be threatened by surrounding hill tribes (Sabines, Aequi, and Volsci), who experienced overpopulation and tried to acquire more land. Thus Rome’s external affairs during the 5th century largely revolved around its military assistance to the Latin League to hold back these invaders. Many details in Livy’s account of this fighting are, however, unreliable. In order to have a literary theme worthy of Rome’s later greatness, Livy’s annalistic sources had described these conflicts in the most grandiose terms. Yet the armies, military ranks, castrametation (<e>i.e.</e>, techniques in making and fortifying encampments), and tactics described belong to the late republic, not the Rome of the 5th century.

            <headtitle>Roman expansion in Italy</headtitle>
            <p>
              Toward the end of the 5th century, while Rome and the Latins were still defending themselves against the Volsci and the Aequi, the Romans began to expand at the expense of Etruscan states. Rome’s incessant warfare and expansion during the republic has spawned modern debate about the nature of Roman imperialism. Ancient Roman historians, who were often patriotic senators, believed that Rome always waged <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308720" tocid="">just wars</xref> in self-defense, and they wrote their accounts accordingly, distorting or suppressing facts that did not fit this view. The modern thesis of Roman defensive imperialism, which followed this ancient bias, is now largely discredited. Only the fighting in the 5th century <e ty="s">bc</e> and the later wars against the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="227066" tocid="">Gauls</xref> can clearly be so characterized. Rome’s relentless expansion was more often responsible for provoking its neighbours to fight in self-defense. Roman consuls, who led the legions into battle, often advocated war because victory gained them personal glory. Members of the centuriate assembly, which, as noted above, decided war and peace, may sometimes have voted for war in expectation that it would lead to personal enrichment through seizure and distribution of booty. The evidence concerning Roman expansion during the early republic is poor, but the fact that Rome created 14 new rustic tribes during the years 387–241 <e ty="s">bc</e> suggests that population growth could have been a driving force. Furthermore, Romans living on the frontier may have strongly favoured war against restless neighbours, such as Gauls and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="520565" tocid="">Samnites</xref>. The animal husbandry of the latter involved seasonal migrations between summer uplands and winter lowlands, which caused friction between them and settled Roman farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the Romans did not wage wars for religious ends, they often used religious means to assist their war effort. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="205491" tocid="">fetial</xref> priests were used for the solemn official declaration of war. According to fetial law, Rome could enjoy divine favour only if it waged just wars—that is, wars of self-defense. In later practice, this often simply meant that Rome maneuvered other states into declaring war upon it. Then Rome followed with its declaration, acting technically in self-defense; this strategy had the effect of boosting Roman morale and sometimes swaying international public opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rome’s first major war against an organized state was fought with Fidenae (437–426 <e ty="s">bc</e>), a town located just upstream from Rome. After it had been conquered, its land was annexed to Roman territory. Rome next fought a long and difficult war against Veii, an important Etruscan city not far from Fidenae. Later Roman historians portrayed the war as having lasted 10 years (406–396 <e ty="s">bc</e>), patterning it after the mythical <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606309" tocid="">Trojan War</xref> of the Greeks. After its conquest, Veii’s tutelary goddess, Queen Juno, was solemnly summoned to Rome. The city’s territory was annexed, increasing Roman territory by 84 percent and forming four new rustic tribes. During the wars against Fidenae and Veii, Rome increased the number of military tribunes with consular power from three to four and then from four to six. In 406 <e ty="s">bc</e> Rome instituted military pay, and in 403 <e ty="s">bc</e> it increased the size of its cavalry. The conquest of Veii opened southern Etruria to further Roman expansion. During the next few years, Rome proceeded to found colonies at Nepet and Sutrium and forced the towns of Falerii and Capena to become its allies. Yet, before Roman strength increased further, a marauding Gallic tribe swept down from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="465567" tocid="">Po River</xref> valley, raided Etruria, and descended upon Rome. The Romans were defeated in the battle of the Allia River in 390 <e ty="s">bc</e>, and the Gauls captured and sacked the city; they departed only after they had received ransom in gold. Henceforth the Romans greatly feared and respected the potential strength of the Gauls. Later Roman historians, however, told patriotic tales about the commanders Marcus Manlius and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="91012" tocid="">Marcus Furius Camillus</xref> in order to mitigate the humiliation of the defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Roman power had suffered a great reversal, and 40 years of hard fighting in Latium and Etruria were required to restore it fully. The terms of the second treaty between Rome and Carthage (348 <e ty="s">bc</e>) show Rome’s sphere of influence to be about the same as it had been at the time of the first treaty in 509, but Rome’s position in Latium was now far stronger.
            </p>
            <h3 tocid="26603">
              <headtitle>The Samnite Wars</headtitle>
              <p>During the 40 years after the second treaty with Carthage, Rome rapidly rose to a position of hegemony in Italy south of the Po valley. Much of the fighting during this time consisted of three wars against the Samnites, who initially were not politically unified but coexisted as separate Oscan-speaking tribes of the central and southern Apennines. Rome’s expansion was probably responsible for uniting these tribes militarily to oppose a common enemy. Both the rugged terrain and the tough Samnite soldiers proved to be formidable challenges, which forced Rome to adopt military innovations that were later important for conquering the Mediterranean.</p>
              <p>
                Despite its brevity (343–341 <e ty="s">bc</e>), the First Samnite War resulted in the major acquisition to the Roman state of the rich land of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="91129" tocid="">Campania</xref> with its capital of Capua. Roman historians modeled their description of the war’s beginning on the Greek historian Thucydides’ account of the outbreak of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="449362" tocid="">Peloponnesian War</xref> between Athens and Sparta. Nevertheless, they were probably correct in stating that the Campanians, when fighting over the town of Capua with the Samnites, allied themselves with Rome in order to utilize its might to settle the quarrel. If so, this may have been the first of many instances in which Rome went to war after being invited into an alliance by a weaker state already at war. Once invited in, Rome usually absorbed the allied state after defeating its adversary. In any event, Campania now somehow became firmly attached to Rome; it may have been granted Roman citizenship without the right to vote in Rome (<e>civitas sine suffragio</e>). Campania was a major addition to Rome’s strength and manpower.
              </p>
              <p>
                The absorption of Campania provoked the Latins to take up arms against Rome to maintain their independence. Since the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 <e ty="s">bc</e>, the city had become increasingly dominant within the Latin League. In 381 <e ty="s">bc</e> Tusculum was absorbed by being given Roman citizenship. In 358 <e ty="s">bc</e> Rome created two more rustic tribes from territory captured along the Volscian coast. The Latin War (340–338 <e ty="s">bc</e>) was quickly decided in Rome’s favour. Virtually all of Latium was given Roman citizenship and became Roman territory, but the towns retained their local governments. The large states of Praeneste and Tibur maintained nominal independence by becoming Rome’s military allies. Thus the Latin League was abolished; but the legal rights that the Latins had enjoyed among themselves were retained by Rome as a legal status, the Latin right (<e>ius Latii</e>), and used for centuries as an intermediate step between non-Roman status and full Roman citizenship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rome was now the master of central Italy and spent the next decade organizing and pushing forward its frontier through conquest and colonization. The Romans soon confronted the Samnites of the middle Liris (modern Liri) River valley, sparking the Second, or Great, Samnite War (326–304 <e ty="s">bc</e>). During the first half of the war Rome suffered serious defeats, but the second half saw Rome’s recovery, reorganization, and ultimate victory. In 321 <e ty="s">bc</e> a Roman army was trapped in a narrow canyon near the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="100380" tocid="">Caudine Forks</xref> and compelled to surrender, and Rome was forced to sign a five-year treaty. Later Roman historians, however, tried to deny this humiliation by inventing stories of Rome’s rejection of the peace and its revenge upon the Samnites. In 315 <e ty="s">bc</e>, after the resumption of hostilities, Rome suffered a crushing defeat at Lautulae. Ancient sources state that Rome initially borrowed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="271570" tocid="">hoplite</xref> tactics from the Etruscans (used during the 6th or 5th centuries <e ty="s">bc</e>) but later adopted the manipular system of the Samnites, probably as a result of Samnite success at this time. The manipular formation resembled a checkerboard pattern, in which solid squares of soldiers were separated by empty square spaces. It was far more flexible than the solidly massed hoplite formation, allowing the army to maneuver better on rugged terrain. The system was retained throughout the republic and into the empire. During these same years Rome organized a rudimentary navy, constructed its first military roads (construction of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30587" tocid="">Via Appia</xref> was begun in 312 <e ty="s">bc</e> and of the Via Valeria in 306), and increased the size of its annual military levy as seen from the increase of annually elected military tribunes from 6 to 16. During the period 334–295 <e ty="s">bc</e>, Rome founded 13 colonies against the Samnites and created six new rustic tribes in annexed territory. During the last years of the war, the Romans also extended their power into northern Etruria and Umbria. Several successful campaigns forced the cities in these areas to become Rome’s allies. The Great Samnite War finally ended in Rome’s victory. During the final phase of this war, Rome, on another front, concluded its third treaty with Carthage (306 <e ty="s">bc</e>), in which the Carthaginians acknowledged all of Italy as Rome’s sphere of influence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Third Samnite War (298–290 <e ty="s">bc</e>) was the last desperate attempt of the Samnites to remain independent. They persuaded the Etruscans, Umbrians, and Gauls to join them. Rome emerged victorious over this formidable coalition at the battle of Sentinum in 295 and spent the remainder of the war putting down lingering Samnite resistance. They henceforth were bound to Rome by a series of alliances.

                The Pyrrhic War, 280–275 <e ty="s">bc</e>
              </headtitle>
              <p>
                Rome spent the 280s <e ty="s">bc</e> putting down unrest in northern Italy, but its attention was soon directed to the far south as well by a quarrel between the Greek city of Thurii and a Samnite tribe. Thurii called upon the assistance of Rome, whose naval operations in the area provoked a war with the Greek city of Tarentum. As in previous conflicts with Italian peoples, Tarentum summoned military aid from mainland Greece, calling upon King <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="485118" tocid="">Pyrrhus</xref> of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="190156" tocid="">Epirus</xref>, one of the most brilliant generals of the ancient world. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="485118" tocid="">Pyrrhus</xref> arrived in southern Italy in 280 <e ty="s">bc</e> with 20 elephants and 25,000 highly trained soldiers. After defeating the Romans at Heraclea and stirring up revolt among the Samnites, he offered peace terms that would have confined Roman power to central Italy. When the Senate wavered, Appius Claudius, an aged blind senator, roused their courage and persuaded them to continue fighting. Pyrrhus again defeated the Romans in 279 at Asculum. His losses in the two battles numbered 7,500 (almost one-third of his entire force). When congratulated on his victory, Pyrrhus, according to Plutarch, “replied . . . that one other such would utterly undo him.” This type of victory has since been referred to as Pyrrhic victory. Pyrrhus then left Italy and aided the Greeks of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="542800" tocid="">Sicily</xref> against Carthage; he eventually returned to Italy and was defeated by the Romans in 275 <e ty="s">bc</e> at Beneventum. He then returned to Greece, while Rome put down resistance in Italy and took Tarentum itself by siege in 272.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rome was now the unquestioned master of Italy. Roman territory was a broad belt across central Italy, from sea to sea. Latin colonies were scattered throughout the peninsula. The other peoples of Italy were bound to Rome by a series of bilateral alliances that obligated them to provide Rome with military forces in wartime. According to the Roman census of 225 <e ty="s">bc</e>, Rome could call upon 700,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalry from its own citizens and allies. The conquest of Italy engendered a strong military ethos among the Roman nobility and citizenry, provided Rome with considerable manpower, and forced it to develop military, political, and legal institutions and practices for conquering and absorbing foreign peoples. The Pyrrhic War demonstrated that Rome’s civilian army could wage a successful war of attrition against highly skilled mercenaries of the Mediterranean world.

                The proximate cause of the first outbreak was a crisis in the city of Messana (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="377202" tocid="">Messina</xref>). A band of Campanian mercenaries, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="360778" tocid="">Mamertini</xref>, who had forcibly established themselves within the town and were being hard pressed in 264 by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="265034" tocid="">Hieron II</xref> of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578823" tocid="">Syracuse</xref>, applied for help to both Rome and Carthage. The Carthaginians, arriving first, occupied Messana and effected a reconciliation with Hieron. The Roman commander, nevertheless, persisted in forcing his troops into the city; he succeeded in seizing the Carthaginian admiral during a parley and induced him to withdraw. This aggression involved Rome in war with Carthage and Syracuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Operations began with their joint attack upon Messana, which the Romans easily repelled. In 263 the Romans advanced with a considerable force into Hieron’s territory and induced him to seek peace and alliance with them. In 262 they besieged and captured the Carthaginian base at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="9760" tocid="">Agrigentum</xref> on the south coast of the island. The first years of the war left little doubt that Roman intentions extended beyond the protection of Messana.

                </thumbasm>In 260 the Romans built their first large fleet of standard battleships. At <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400404" tocid="">Mylae</xref> (Milazzo), off the north Sicilian coast, their admiral <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="173221" tocid="">Gaius Duilius</xref> defeated a Carthaginian squadron of more maneuverable ships by grappling and boarding. This left Rome free to land a force on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="138780" tocid="">Corsica</xref> (259) and expel the Carthaginians, but it did not suffice to loosen their grasp on Sicily. A large Roman fleet sailed out in 256, repelled the entire Carthaginian fleet off Cape Ecnomus (near modern Licata), and established a fortified camp on African soil at Clypea (Kélibia in Tunisia<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="609229" tocid=""></xref>). The Carthaginians, whose citizen levy was utterly disorganized, could neither keep the field against the invaders nor prevent their subjects from revolting. After one campaign they were ready to sue for peace, but the terms offered by the Roman commander <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="496279" tocid="">Marcus Atilius Regulus</xref> were intolerably harsh. Accordingly, the Carthaginians equipped a new army in which cavalry and elephants formed the strongest arm. In 255 they offered battle to Regulus, who had taken up position with an inadequate force near Tunis, outmaneuvered him, and destroyed the bulk of his army. A second Roman fleet, which reached Africa after defeating the full Carthaginian fleet off <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="72642" tocid="">Cape Hermaeum</xref> (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="72642" tocid="">Cape Bon</xref>), withdrew all the remaining troops.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Romans now directed their efforts once more against Sicily. In 254 they captured the important fortress of Panormus (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439625" tocid="">Palermo</xref>), but when Carthage moved reinforcements onto the island, the war again came to a standstill. In 251 or 250 the Roman general Caecilus <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378091" tocid="">Metellus</xref> at last staged a pitched battle near Panormus, in which the enemy’s force was effectively crippled. This victory was followed by a siege of the chief Punic base at Lilybaeum (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="366439" tocid="">Marsala</xref>), together with Drepanum (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="603389" tocid="">Trapani</xref>), by land and sea. In the face of resistance, the Romans were compelled to withdraw in 249; in a surprise attack upon Drepanum the Roman fleet under the command of admiral <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120531" tocid="">Publius Claudius Pulcher</xref> lost 93 ships. This was the Romans’ only naval defeat in the war. Their fleet, however, had suffered a series of grievous losses by storm and was now so reduced that the attack upon Sicily had to be suspended. At the same time, the Carthaginians, who felt no less severely the financial strain of the prolonged struggle, reduced their forces and made no attempt to deliver a counterattack.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 242 Rome resumed operations at sea. A fleet of 200 warships was equipped and sent out to renew the blockade of Lilybaeum. The Carthaginians hastily assembled a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497046" tocid="">relief</xref> force, but in a battle fought off the Aegates, or Aegusae (Aegadian) Islands, west of Drepanum, their fleet was caught at a disadvantage and was largely sunk or captured (March 10, 241). This victory, by giving the Romans undisputed command of the sea, rendered certain the ultimate fall of the Punic strongholds in Sicily. The Carthaginians accordingly opened negotiations and consented to a peace by which they ceded Sicily and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189371" tocid="">Lipari Islands</xref> to Rome and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents. The protracted nature of the war and the repeated loss of ships resulted in an enormous loss of life and resources on both sides.

A gross breach of the treaty was perpetrated when a Roman force was sent to occupy <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="524148" tocid="">Sardinia</xref>, whose insurgent garrison had offered to surrender the island (238). To the remonstrances of Carthage the Romans replied with a declaration of war and only withheld their attack upon the cession of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of a further indemnity.

              <p>
                From this episode it became clear that Rome intended to use the victory to the utmost. To avoid further infringement of its hegemony, Carthage had little choice but to respond with force. The recent complications of foreign and internal strife had indeed so weakened the Punic power that the prospect of renewing the war under favourable circumstances seemed remote. Yet <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="253349" tocid="">Hamilcar Barca</xref> sought to rebuild Carthaginian strength by acquiring a dominion in Spain where Carthage might gain new wealth and manpower. Invested with an unrestricted foreign command, he spent the rest of his life founding a Spanish empire (237–228). His work was continued by his son-in-law <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="256510" tocid="">Hasdrubal</xref> and his son <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="254423" tocid="">Hannibal</xref>, who was placed at the head of the army in 221. These conquests aroused the suspicions of Rome, which in a treaty with Hasdrubal confined the Carthaginians to the south of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177649" tocid="">Ebro River</xref>. At some point Rome also entered into relations with Saguntum (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="516338" tocid="">Sagunto</xref>), a town on the east coast, south of the Ebro. To the Carthaginians it seemed that once again Rome was expanding its interests into their sphere of hegemony. In 219 Hannibal laid siege to Saguntum and carried the town in spite of stubborn defense. The Romans responded with an ultimatum demanding that the Carthaginians surrender Hannibal or go to war. The Carthaginian council supported Hannibal and accepted the war.

              <p>It seemed that the superiority of the Romans at sea ought to have enabled them to choose the field of battle. They decided to send one army to Spain and another to Sicily and Africa. But before their preparations were complete, Hannibal began the series of operations that dictated the course of the war for the greater part of its duration. He realized that as long as the Romans commanded the resources of an undivided Italian confederacy, no foreign attack could overwhelm them beyond recovery. Thus he conceived the plan of cutting off their source of strength by carrying the war into Italy and causing a disruption of the league. His chances of ever reaching Italy seemed small, for the sea was guarded by the Roman fleets and the land route was long and arduous.</p>
              <p>
                But the very boldness of his enterprise contributed to its success; after a six months’ march through Spain and Gaul and over the Alps, which the Romans were nowhere in time to oppose, Hannibal arrived (autumn 218) in the plain of the Po with 20,000 foot soldiers and 6,000 horses, the pick of his African and Spanish levies. At the end of the year, Hannibal, by superior tactics, repelled a Roman army on the banks of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="603899" tocid="">Trebbia River</xref>, inflicting heavy losses, and thus made his position in northern Italy secure.

                In 217 the campaign opened in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194570" tocid="">Etruria</xref>, into which the invading army, largely reinforced by Gauls, penetrated via an unguarded pass. A rash pursuit by the Roman field force led to its being entrapped on the shore of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="603438" tocid="">Lake Trasimene</xref> (Trasimeno) and destroyed with a loss of at least 15,000 men. This catastrophe left Rome completely uncovered; but Hannibal, having resolved not to attack the capital before he could collect a more overwhelming force, directed his march toward the south of Italy, where he hoped to stir up the peoples who had formerly been the most stubborn enemies of Rome. The Italians, however, were slow everywhere to join the Carthaginians. A new Roman army under the dictator Quintus <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="199706" tocid="">Fabius Maximus</xref> (“Cunctator”) dogged Hannibal’s steps on his forays through <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483005" tocid="">Apulia</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="91129" tocid="">Campania</xref> and prevented him from acquiring a permanent base of operations.

              <p>
                The eventful campaign of 216 was begun by a new, aggressive move on the part of Rome. An exceptionally strong field army, variously estimated at between 48,000 and 85,000 men, was sent to crush the Carthaginians in open battle. On a level plain near <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="92664" tocid="">Cannae</xref> in Apulia, Hannibal deliberately allowed his centre to be driven in by the numerically superior Romans, while Hasdrubal’s cavalry wheeled around so as to take the enemy in flank and rear. The Romans, surrounded on all sides, were practically annihilated, and the loss of citizens was perhaps greater than in any other defeat that befell the republic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effect of the battle on morale was no less momentous. The southern Italian peoples seceded from Rome, the leaders of the movement being the people of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="94379" tocid="">Capua</xref>, at the time the second greatest town of Italy. Reinforcements were sent from Carthage, and several neutral powers prepared to throw their weight into the scale on Hannibal’s behalf. But the great resources of Rome, though terribly reduced in respect to both men and money, were not yet exhausted. In northern and central Italy the insurrection spread but little and could be sufficiently guarded against with small detachments. In the south the Greek towns of the coast remained loyal, and the numerous Latin colonies continued to render important service by interrupting free communication between the rebels and detaining part of their forces.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Rome itself the crisis gave way to a unanimity unparalleled in the annals of the republic. The guidance of operations was henceforth left to the Senate, which, by maintaining a persistent policy until the conflict was brought to a successful end, earned its greatest title to fame. But it also produced a severe strain, released through cruel religious rites, which were an embarrassment to later Roman authors. The disasters were interpreted as evidence of divine wrath at Roman impiety, to be propitiated by punishment (burial alive) of two offending <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626935" tocid="">Vestal Virgins</xref> and by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275881" tocid="">human sacrifice</xref> of a Gallic and Greek man and woman.
              </p>
              <p>
                The subsequent campaigns of the war in Italy assumed a new character. Though the Romans contrived at times to raise 200,000 men, they could spare only a moderate force for field operations. Their generals, among whom the veterans Fabius and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364120" tocid="">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</xref> frequently held the most important commands, rarely ventured to engage Hannibal in the open and contented themselves with observing him or skirmishing against his detachments. Hannibal, whose recent accessions of strength were largely discounted by the necessity of assigning troops to protect his new allies or secure their wavering loyalty, was still too weak to undertake a vigorous offensive. In the ensuing years the war resolved itself into a multiplicity of minor engagements, which need not be followed in detail. In 216 and 215 the chief seat of war was Campania, where Hannibal, vainly attempting to establish himself on the coast, experienced a severe repulse at Nola.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 214 the main Carthaginian force was transferred from Apulia in hopes of capturing Tarentum (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="583349" tocid="">Taranto</xref>), a suitable harbour by which Hannibal might have secured his overseas communications. In 213–212 the greater part of Tarentum and other cities of the southern seaboard at last came into Hannibal’s power, but in the meantime the Romans were suppressing the revolt in Campania and in 212 were strong enough to place Capua under blockade. They severely defeated a Carthaginian relief force and could not be permanently dislodged even by Hannibal himself. In 211 Hannibal made a last effort to relieve his allies by a feint upon Rome itself, but the besiegers refused to be drawn away from their entrenchments, and eventually Capua was starved into surrender. The Romans in 209 gained a further important success by recovering Tarentum. Though Hannibal still won isolated engagements, he was slowly being driven back into the extreme south of the peninsula.

              <p>
                In 207 the arrival of a fresh invading force produced a new crisis. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="256514" tocid="">Hasdrubal</xref>, who in 208–207 had marched overland from Spain, appeared in northern Italy with a force scarcely inferior to the army that his brother had brought in 218. After levying contingents of Gauls and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="340874" tocid="">Ligurians</xref>, he marched down the east coast with the object of joining his brother in central Italy for a direct attack upon Rome itself. By this time the steady drain of men and money was telling so severely upon the confederacy that some of the most loyal allies protested their inability to render further help. Nonetheless, by exerting a supreme effort, the Romans raised their war establishment to the highest total yet attained and sent a strong field army against each Carthaginian leader. Before reaching Hannibal, Hasdrubal was met in northern Italy by the army of Marcus Livius Salinator, reinforced by part of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223590" tocid="">Gaius</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120493" tocid="">Claudius</xref> Nero<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409505" tocid=""></xref>’s army. The battle on the banks of the Metaurus (Metauro) River was evenly contested until Nero, with a dexterous flanking movement, cut off the enemy’s retreat. The bulk of Hasdrubal’s army was destroyed, and he himself was killed. His head was tossed into his brother’s camp as an announcement of his defeat.

              <p>
                The campaign of 207 decided the war in Italy. Though Hannibal still maintained himself for some years in southern Italy, this was chiefly due to the exhaustion of Rome. In 203 Hannibal, in accordance with orders received from home, sailed back to Africa; and another expedition under his brother <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="357706" tocid="">Mago</xref>, which had sailed to Liguria in 205 and endeavoured to rouse the slumbering discontent of the people in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118628" tocid="">Cisalpine Gaul</xref> and Etruria, was forced to withdraw.

                Concurrently with the great struggle in Italy, the Second Punic War was fought on several other fields. To the east King <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456214" tocid="">Philip V</xref> of Macedon began the First <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="354319" tocid="">Macedonian War</xref> (214–205) in concert with the Carthaginians, when the Roman power seemed to be breaking up after Cannae.

              </p>
              <p>Agriculture in Italy had collapsed, and the Romans had to look to Sardinia and Sicily for their food supply. Sardinia was attacked by Carthaginians in 215, but a small Roman force was enough to repel the invasion. In Sicily the death of Hieron II, Rome’s steadfast friend, in 215 left the realm of Syracuse to his inexperienced grandson Hieronymus. The young prince abruptly broke with the Romans, but before hostilities commenced he was assassinated. The Syracusan people now repudiated the monarchy and resumed their republican constitution. When the Romans threatened terrible punishment, the Syracusans found it necessary to cooperate with the Carthaginians.</p>

                The Roman army and fleet under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364120" tocid="">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</xref>, which speedily appeared before the town, were completely baffled by the mechanical contrivances that the Syracusan mathematician Archimedes had invented in 213 for the defense of the city.

In 212 Marcellus at last broke through the defense of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578823" tocid="">Syracuse</xref> and, in spite of the arrival of a Carthaginian relief force, took control of the whole town in 211. By the end of 210 Sicily was wholly under the power of Rome.

              <p>
                The conflict in Spain was second in importance only to the Italian war. From this country the Carthaginians drew large supplies of troops and money that might serve to reinforce Hannibal; hence it was in the interest of the Romans to challenge their enemy within Spain. Though the force that Rome at first spared for this war was small in numbers and rested entirely upon its own resources, the generals <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="529042" tocid="">Publius Cornelius</xref> and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, by skillful strategy and diplomacy, not only won over the peoples north of the Ebro and defeated the Carthaginian leader Hasdrubal Barca in his attempts to restore communication with Italy but also carried their arms along the east coast into the heart of the enemy’s domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                But eventually the Roman successes were nullified by a rash advance. Deserted by their native contingents and cut off by Carthaginian cavalry, among which the Numidian prince <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367882" tocid="">Masinissa</xref> rendered conspicuous service, the Roman generals were killed and their troops destroyed (211).

              <p>
                Disturbances in Africa prevented the Punic commanders from exploiting their success. Before long the fall of Capua enabled Rome to transfer troops from Italy to Spain; and in 210 the best Roman general of the day, the young son and namesake of Publius Scipio, was placed in command by popular vote, despite his youth and lack of the prerequisite senior magistracies. He signalized his arrival by a bold and successful coup de main upon the great arsenal of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="97167" tocid="">Carthago Nova</xref> (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="97167" tocid="">Cartagena</xref>) in 209. Though after an engagement at Baecula (Bailen; 208) he was unable to prevent Hasdrubal Barca from marching away to Italy, Scipio profited by his opponent’s departure to push back the remaining hostile forces the more rapidly. A last effort by the Carthaginians to retrieve their losses with a fresh army was frustrated by a great Roman victory at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="282852" tocid="">Ilipa</xref>, near Sevilla (Seville), and by the end of the year 206 the Carthaginians had been driven out of Spain.

He was met there by a combined levy of Carthage and King <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578767" tocid="">Syphax</xref> of Numidia and for a time was penned to the shore near Utica.

These disasters induced the Carthaginians to sue for peace; but before the very moderate terms that Scipio offered could be definitely accepted, a sudden reversal of opinion caused them to recall Hannibal’s army for a final trial of war and to break off negotiations. In 202 Hannibal assumed command of a composite force of citizen and mercenary levies reinforced by a corps of his veteran Italian troops.

                After negotiations failed, Scipio and Hannibal met in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="655514" tocid="">Battle of Zama</xref>. Scipio’s force was somewhat smaller in numbers but well trained throughout and greatly superior in cavalry. His infantry, after evading an attack by the Carthaginian elephants, cut through the first two lines of the enemy but was unable to break the reserve corps of Hannibal’s veterans. The battle was ultimately decided by the cavalry of the Romans and their new ally Masinissa, who by a maneuver recalling the tactics of Cannae took Hannibal’s line in the rear and destroyed it.

              <p>
                The Carthaginians again applied for peace and accepted the terms that Scipio offered.

The failure of Hannibal’s brilliant endeavour was ultimately due to the stern determination of the Romans and to the nearly inexhaustible manpower from their Italian confederacy, which no shock of defeat or strain of war could entirely disintegrate. Although Rome and its allies suffered casualties of perhaps one-fifth of their adult male population, they continued fighting.

              <p>
                Just before the Second Punic War, Rome had projected its power across the Adriatic Sea against the Illyrians. As noted, Philip V of Macedon in turn had joined the Carthaginians for a time during the war in an attempt to stem the tide of Roman expansion but had agreed to terms of peace with Rome’s allies, the Aetolians, in 206 and then with Rome in the Peace of Phoenice of 205. Immediately after the Second Punic War the Roman Senate moved to settle affairs with Philip, despite the war-weary centuriate assembly’s initial refusal to declare war. Historians have debated Rome’s reasons for this momentous decision, with suggestions ranging from a desire to protect Athenians and other Greeks from Philip out of philhellenism to fear of a secret alliance between Philip and the Seleucid king <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28361" tocid="">Antiochus III</xref>. Yet these suggestions are belied by the fact that Rome later treated the Greek cities callously and that no fear is apparent in Rome’s increasing demands on Philip and in its refusal to negotiate seriously with him through the course of the war. Rather, the Second <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="354319" tocid="">Macedonian War</xref> (200–196) fits the long pattern of Roman readiness to go to war in order to force ever more distant neighbours to submit to superior Roman power.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the winter of 200–199, Roman legions marched into the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="50325" tocid="">Balkans</xref> under the command of Publius Sulpicius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223861" tocid="">Galba</xref>. During the next two years there was no decisive battle, as the Romans gathered allies among the Greeks—not only their previous allies, the Aetolians, but also Philip’s traditional allies, the Achaeans, who recognized Roman military superiority. The consul of 198, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="209437" tocid="">Titus Quinctius Flamininus</xref>, took over the command and defeated Philip at the battle of Cynoscephalae in 197. The terms of settlement allowed Philip to remain king of Macedon but stipulated payment of an indemnity and restrictions on campaigning beyond the borders of his kingdom. Flamininus then sought to win the goodwill of the Greeks with his famous proclamation of their liberation at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="297037" tocid="">Isthmian Games</xref> of 196. To lend credibility to this proclamation, he successfully argued against senatorial opposition for the withdrawal of Roman troops from all Greece, including the strategically important “Fetters” (the key garrisons of Acrocorinth, Chalcis, and Demetrias).
              </p>
              <p>
                Even before the Romans withdrew, the seeds had been sown for their reentry into the East. As an active king, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28361" tocid="">Antiochus III</xref> set out to recover the ancestral possessions of his kingdom on the western coast of Anatolia and in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="593540" tocid="">Thrace</xref>. In response to the Roman demand that he stay out of Europe, the king attempted to negotiate. When the Romans showed little interest in compromise, Antiochus accepted the invitation of Rome’s former allies, the Aetolians, who felt they had not been duly rewarded with additional territory after the victory over Philip, to liberate the Greeks. Upon crossing into Greece, however, the king found no enthusiasm among the other Greeks for a war of liberation and was defeated at Thermopylae in 191 by legions under the command of Manius Acilius Glabrio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Antiochus returned home to gather a larger army. In 190 Lucius Cornelius Scipio was elected consul in Rome and was authorized to recruit a force for a campaign against Antiochus. Accompanying Lucius as a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="334911" tocid="">legate</xref> was his brother, the great general Scipio Africanus. In an attempt to avert war, Antiochus offered to accept the earlier Roman terms, only to find that the Romans had now extended their demands to keep Antiochus east of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="584415" tocid="">Taurus Mountains</xref> of Anatolia. Unable to accept, Antiochus fought and lost to Scipio’s army at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="356876" tocid="">Magnesia ad Sipylum</xref> in the winter of 190–189. In the following Treaty of Apamea (188), the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="533278" tocid="">Seleucid kingdom</xref> was limited to Asia east of the Taurus range and was required to pay an indemnity of 15,000 talents and to give up its elephants and all but 10 ships. Rome punished its opponents, the Aetolians, and rewarded its supporters, notably Pergamum and Rhodes, which were granted new territories, including Greek cities, at the expense of “the liberation of the Greeks.” The consul of 189, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, came east with reinforcements, took command of the legions, and proceeded to plunder the Galatians of Anatolia on the pretext of restoring order.
              </p>
              <p>
                The withdrawal of Roman legions this time did not entail the withdrawal of a Roman presence from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="260307" tocid="">Hellenistic</xref> East. On the contrary, according to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="468317" tocid="">Polybius</xref>, the Romans now “were displeased if all matters were not referred to them and if everything was not done in accordance with their decision.” Continuing jealousies and disputes in the Greek world offered Rome opportunities to adjudicate and ultimately to intervene once again. In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="449351" tocid="">Peloponnese</xref> the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="3396" tocid="">Achaean League</xref> was at odds with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="558311" tocid="">Sparta</xref>, wishing to bring Sparta into the league and to suppress the radical social program of its king, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="401285" tocid="">Nabis</xref>. Flamininus in 195 supported the independence of Sparta, but in 192 the Achaean leader, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456701" tocid="">Philopoemen</xref>, induced Sparta to join the league with a promise of no interference in its internal affairs. When an infringement of the promise prompted the Spartans to secede, Philopoemen in 188 led an Achaean army to take Sparta, kill the anti-Achaean leaders, and force the city back into the league. Although the Senate heard complaints, it took no immediate action. Then, in 184, the Senate reasserted its own terms for settlement but was circumvented by Philopoemen, who reached a separate agreement with the Spartans. The independent-minded Philopoemen died the following year in a campaign by the league to suppress a revolt of Messene. His death led to a change of leadership, as the pro-Roman Callicrates (regarded by Polybius as a sycophant) began a policy of obeying Rome’s every wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, tensions between Rome and Philip were increasing. Philip had supported Rome’s war with Antiochus in the hope of recovering Thessalian and Thracian territory, but in this he was disappointed by the Romans. They did, however, return Philip’s younger son, Demetrius, taken to Rome as a hostage in 197—a reward with tragic consequences. During his years as a hostage, Demetrius had made senatorial friendships, which aroused suspicions at home that the Romans would prefer to see Demetrius rather than his elder brother, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="452697" tocid="">Perseus</xref>, succeed Philip. Philip ordered the death of Demetrius in 181 and then died in 179, leaving his throne to Perseus, the last king of Macedon.
              </p>
              <p>Perseus’ activism started a stream of complaints to the Senate from neighbouring Greek powers from 175 onward. The king’s real intentions are unclear; perhaps Polybius was right that he wished to make the Romans “more cautious about delivering harsh and unjust orders to Macedonians.” The Senate listened to the unfavourable interpretations of Perseus’ enemies, who claimed that the king’s actions revealed an intent to attack Rome. Like his father, Perseus campaigned to extend Macedonian power to the northeast and south and marched through Greece as far as Delphi. He solicited alliances with the Achaean League and other Greek states, which some of the leaders hostile to Rome would have liked to accept. He arranged dynastic marriages with other Hellenistic kings, taking the daughter of Seleucus IV as his wife and giving the hand of his sister to Prusias II of Bithynia. Although these actions could have been viewed as the behaviour expected of a Hellenistic monarch, Eumenes of Pergamum suggested to the Senate that Perseus was preparing for war against Rome. After the Senate decided on war, it sent Quintus Marcius Philippus to propose a truce and to give Perseus false hopes of negotiation in order to allow the consul of 171, Publius Licinius Crassus, to land his army on the Illyrian coast unhindered—a ploy decried by some older senators as “the new wisdom.”</p>
              <p>
                Perseus’ initial success against the Roman army in Thessaly in 171 did not alter the massive imbalance of power; the Romans again refused the king’s offer to negotiate. Over the next three years Roman commanders devoted more effort to plunder than to the defeat of Perseus. In a notorious incident, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473655" tocid="">praetor</xref> Lucius Hortensius anchored his fleet at Abdera, a city allied with Rome, and demanded supplies; when the Abderitans asked to consult the Senate, Hortensius sacked the town, executed the leading citizens, and enslaved the rest. When complaints reached the Senate, weak attempts were made to force the Roman commanders to make restitution. In 168 the experienced Lucius Aemilius Paullus was reelected consul and sent out to restore discipline. He quickly brought the Third <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="354319" tocid="">Macedonian War</xref> to an end by defeating Perseus in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="484531" tocid="">Battle of Pydna</xref> in June 168. Perseus was deposed, and Macedonia was divided into four republics, which were forbidden to have relations with one another; they paid tribute to Rome at half the rate they had previously paid to the king.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 167 Rome proceeded to punish those who had sided with Perseus (such as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283105" tocid="">Illyrian</xref> Genthius), those whose loyalty had wavered (such as Eumenes), and even those who had contemplated acting as mediators in the war (such as the Rhodians). In Illyria, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447198" tocid="">Paullus</xref>, on instructions from the Senate, swept through the countryside enslaving 150,000 inhabitants from 70 Epirote towns. In Achaea, 1,000 leading men suspected of Macedonian sympathies were taken as hostages to Rome. (Among them was Polybius, who befriended the noble Scipionic family and wrote his great history of the rise of Rome with the aid of privileged access to the views of the senatorial leadership.) Eumenes was refused a hearing before the Senate on his visit to Italy; his fall from favour prompted his enemies to dispute his territory, and in 164 a Roman embassy in Anatolia publicly invited complaints against the king. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501581" tocid="">Rhodes</xref> had thrived as the leading trade centre of the eastern Mediterranean, using its considerable resources to control <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="461493" tocid="">piracy</xref>; now Rome undermined its economy and power by making the island of Delos a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218417" tocid="">free port</xref>, thereby depriving Rhodes of its income from harbour dues. Territory in Lycia and Caria on the mainland, granted to Rhodes in 189, was now taken away. But the far harsher proposal in the Senate to declare Rhodes an enemy and to destroy it was opposed by senior senators such as Cato the Censor and was voted down. As a result of the weakening of Rhodes, piracy became rampant in the eastern Mediterranean (the young <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88114" tocid="">Julius Caesar</xref> was captured by pirates). During the next century Roman senators did not find the political will to suppress the piracy, perhaps in part because it served their interests; pirates supplied tens of thousands of slaves for their Italian estates and disrupted the grain trade, thus raising prices for their produce in Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                The arrangements of 167 served the Roman policy of weakening the powers of the eastern Mediterranean. In the previous year Rome had also intervened to stop Seleucid expansion into <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="180382" tocid="">Egypt</xref>. In a famous episode, the Roman ambassador Gaius Popillius Laenas delivered to Antiochus IV the Senate’s demand that the king withdraw from Egypt. When the king requested time for consultation, Popillius “drew a circle around the king with a stick he was carrying and told him not to leave the circle until he gave his response. The king was astonished at this occurrence and the display of superiority, but, after a brief time, said he would do all the Romans demanded.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The power vacuum fostered by the Romans was not ultimately conducive to stability. An adventurer, Andriscus, claiming to be descended from the Macedonian dynasty, was able to enter the Macedonian republics without serious resistance. He was successful enough in raising an army to defeat the first Roman force sent against him in 149 under the command of the praetor Publius Iuventius Thalna (who was killed). A second Roman army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus defeated the pretender in 148. With the death of Callicrates, leadership of the Achaean League passed to Critolaus and Diaeus, outspoken proponents of Greek independence from Rome. In 147 a Roman embassy was sent to intervene in the affairs of the league by supporting the secession of Sparta and also by calling for the detachment of Corinth and Argos from the league. The embassy provoked a violent reply. When further negotiations were blocked by Critolaus, Rome declared war on the Achaeans in 146, citing as reason the ill-treatment of their embassy. Metellus (now with the appellation of “Macedonicus”), having delayed with his army, marched against Critolaus and defeated him in Locris. Then <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="397336" tocid="">Lucius Mummius</xref> Archaicus, consul of 146, took over the command and defeated Diaeus and the remaining Achaeans. The Senate ordered Mummius to teach a lesson to the Greeks: the venerable city of Corinth was sacked, its treasures taken to Rome, and its buildings burned to the ground.

                The nature of Roman domination in the East began to change decisively after these wars: in place of influence through embassies, arbitration of disputes, and the occasional military incursion came direct rule. Macedonia was annexed as a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="480673" tocid="">province</xref>, to be governed and taxed by a Roman proconsul, who also watched over the Greek cities to the south, where the leagues were disbanded. Farther east, the kingdom of Pergamum was added as the province of Asia, as a bequest to the Roman people from Attalus III in 133.

                If Roman military intervention in the east was sporadic in the 2nd century, campaigning in northern Italy and Spain was nearly continuous. During Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="289440" tocid="">Insubres</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="71745" tocid="">Boii</xref>, Gallic peoples in the Po valley, had joined the Carthaginians against Rome.

In the following years consular armies repeatedly attacked the Gauls. In 194 Lucius Valerius Flaccus won a decisive victory over the Insubres; in 192 the leading Boii under severe pressure went over to the Roman side, signaling the coming defeat of their tribe. Following their victories, the Romans sent thousands of new colonists to the Po valley to reinforce the older colonies of Placentia and Cremona (190) and to establish new colonies, notably Bononia (189) and Aquileia (181).
              </p>
              <p>
                During the same period the Romans were at war with the Ligurian tribes of the northern Apennines. The serious effort began in 182, when both consular armies and a proconsular army were sent against the Ligurians. The wars continued into the 150s, when victorious generals celebrated two triumphs over the Ligurians. Here also the Romans drove many natives off their land and settled colonies in their stead (<e>e.g.</e>, Luna and Luca in the 170s).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result of the Second Punic War, Roman legions had marched into Spain against the Carthaginians and remained there after 201. The Romans formalized their rule in 197 by creating two provinces, Nearer and Further Spain. They also exploited the Spanish riches, especially the mines, as the Carthaginians had done. In 197 the legions were withdrawn, but a Spanish revolt against the Roman presence led to the death of one governor and required that the two praetorian governors of 196 be accompanied by a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="335026" tocid="">legion</xref> each. The situation was serious enough for the consul of 195, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99975" tocid="">Cato the Censor</xref>, to be sent to Spain with two legions. From Cato comes the earliest extant firsthand account of Roman conquest. His comments show that he prided himself on his bravery and lack of greed as compared with other Roman commanders. Yet his narrative must overstate the extent and decisiveness of his success because fighting persisted for years to come, as later Roman governors sought to extend Roman control over more Spanish peoples—the Celtiberi of northeastern Spain, the Lusitani of modern-day Portugal, and the Vettones and Vaccaei of northwestern Spain. In 177 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="240427" tocid="">Tiiberius Sempronius Gracchus</xref> celebrated a triumph over the Celtiberi. The size of the Roman forces was probably then reduced from four to two legions; from 173 to 155 there was a lull in the regular campaigning. During these decades Spanish peoples brought complaints to Rome about corrupt governors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Annual warfare resumed in Spain in 154, being perhaps in part a violent reaction to corrupt administration, and dragged on until 133. Labeled a “fiery war” (really wars), these struggles acquired a reputation for extreme cruelty; they brought destruction to the native population (<e>e.g.</e>, 20,000 Vaccaei were killed in 151 after giving themselves up to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350697" tocid="">Lucius Licinius Lucullus</xref>) and made recruiting legionaries in Italy difficult. In Further Spain the Lusitanian leader Viriathus enjoyed some successes, including the surrender of a Roman army in 141–140 and a favourable treaty with Rome, but the next governor of the province, Quintus Servilius Caepio, arranged for his assassination in 139. Two years later in Nearer Spain, the Numantines also forced the surrender of an army under Gaius Hostilius Mancinus; the Senate later disavowed the agreement of equal terms and handed Mancinus, bound and naked, over to the Spaniards to absolve themselves of responsibility before the gods. The wars in Spain were brought to a conclusion in 133 by Publius Cornelius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="529059" tocid="">Scipio Aemilianus</xref>, who took <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422274" tocid="">Numantia</xref> after a long siege, enslaved the population, and razed the city.

              <p>
                It was Scipio Aemilianus (b. 185/184) who in the previous decade had imposed a similar final solution on Carthage in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483533" tocid="">Third Punic War</xref> (149–146). After the Second Punic War, Carthage had recovered to the point that in 191 it offered to repay the remainder of the 50-year tribute of 200 talents per year in one lump sum. Rome’s refusal of the offer suggests that beyond its monetary value the tribute had the symbolic importance of signifying subjection. Carthage’s neighbour, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422426" tocid="">Numidian</xref> king <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367882" tocid="">Masinissa</xref>, had been granted as a reward for his support of Rome at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="655514" tocid="">Battle of Zama</xref> his paternal kingdom and the western Numidian kingdom ruled by Syphax. During the next half century Masinissa periodically tried to exploit his favour in Rome by encroaching on Carthaginian territory. Initially, the Carthaginians submissively sought the arbitration of Rome in these disputes, but more often than not Roman judgment went in favour of Masinissa. After a series of losses, the Carthaginians in 151 decided to act on their own and raised an army to ward off the Numidian attacks. When a Roman delegation observed the Carthaginian army raised in breach of the treaty of 201, Rome was provided with the casus belli for a declaration of war in 149; Polybius, however, claims that the Senate had decided on this war “long before.” The elderly Cato had been ending his speeches in the Senate since 153 with the notorious exhortation that “Carthage must be destroyed.” Carthage desperately and pathetically tried to make amends, executing the generals of the expedition against the Numidians, surrendering to Rome, and handing over hostages, armour, and artillery. Only then did the Romans deliver their final demand: Carthage must be abandoned and the population moved to a new site inland. Such extreme terms could not be accepted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The war against Carthage, with its prospects of rich booty, presented no recruiting problems for the Romans: huge land and naval forces were sent out under both consuls of 149, Lucius Marcius Censorinus and Manius Manilius. The imbalance of resources meant that the outcome was never in doubt, but the fortifications of Carthage delayed the Roman victory. The young Scipio Aemilianus was elected consul for 147, and by popular vote he was assigned the task of bringing the war to an end. He blockaded the city by land and sea, inflicting terrible suffering. Finally, in 146, the Roman army took <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="97373" tocid="">Carthage</xref>, enslaved its remaining 50,000 inhabitants, burned the buildings to the ground, and ritually sowed the site with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="519691" tocid="">salt</xref> to guarantee that nothing would ever grow there again. Carthaginian territory was annexed as the province of Africa.

              <headtitle>Explanations of Roman expansion</headtitle>
              <p>
                As one of the decisive developments in western history, Roman expansion has invited continual reinterpretation by historians. Polybius, who wrote his history in order to explain to other Greeks the reasons for Roman success, believed that after their victory over Hannibal the Romans conceived the aim of dominating all before them and set out to achieve it in the Second Macedonian War. If one accepts the Roman view that they fought only “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308720" tocid="">just wars</xref>”—that is, only when provoked—then Roman conquest emerges as “one of the most important accidents in European history,” as Rome had to defend itself from threats on all sides. Historians have suggested other motives for empire, such as a desire to profit from war, an interest in commercial expansion, or a love of the Greeks, who asked for protection against Hellenistic monarchs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Major historical phenomena of this kind rarely receive final, decisive interpretations, but several assertions may be ventured. Some of the interpretations are anachronistic impositions on the ancient world; ancient testimony, for example, gives no support to commercial or mercantile explanations. Cultural and economic interpretations seem more appropriate. Roman culture placed a high value on success in war: <e>virtus</e> (courage and qualities of leadership) was displayed, above all, in war, and the triumph, a parade through Rome celebrating a major victory over an enemy, was the honour most highly prized by the senatorial generals who guided Roman decisions about war and peace. Moreover, these leaders, and the whole Roman people, were fully aware of the increasing profits of victory; in the 2nd century commanders and soldiers, as well as the city itself, were enriched by the glittering booty from Africa and the Greek East.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, it is rightly pointed out, Roman intervention in the East was sporadic, not systematic, and the Romans did not annex territory in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="50325" tocid="">Balkans</xref>, Anatolia, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418538" tocid="">North Africa</xref> for more than 50 years after their initial victories. The latter point, however, is not telling, since the Romans regarded defeated states allied to them as part of their <e>imperium</e>, whether or not they were under Roman provincial administration. The sporadic timing of the wars would seem to support the Romans’ claim that they only reacted, justly, to provocations. But attention to the individual provocations should not blind the historian to the larger pattern of Roman behaviour. From 218 the Romans annually fielded major armies decade after decade. Rome was able to go to war every year in response to provocations only because it chose to define its interests and make alliances farther and farther afield. Polybius, as noted, reveals how the Romans were the masters of manipulation of circumstances to force opponents to behave in a way they could interpret as provocative. Therefore, the Roman interpretation of “just wars” and the Polybian interpretation of a universal aim to conquer need not be contradictory. The concept of “just war” may have justified any given war but does not explain the perpetual Roman readiness to go to war. For that the historian must look to Polybius’ universal aim or to general political, social, economic, and cultural features of Rome. Finally, it must be remembered that in some instances it was clearly the Roman commander who provoked the war in order to plunder and to win a triumph (<e>e.g.</e>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="339720" tocid="">Licinius</xref> Lucullus, governor of Nearer Spain, in 151).

            <headtitle>Beginnings of provincial administration</headtitle>
            <p>
              Rome dominated its Latin and Italian neighbours by incorporating some into the Roman citizen body and by forming bilateral alliances with most of the Italian city-states. After the Punic Wars, Rome undertook to rule newly acquired territories directly as subject provinces. In 241 Sicily became Rome’s first province, followed by Sardinia-Corsica in 238, and Spain, divided into two provinces, in 197. After a 50-year hiatus, Macedonia and Africa were annexed in 146, and the province of Asia (northwestern Anatolia) in 133. In principle, each province was to be administered in accordance with its <e>lex provinciae</e>, a set of rules drawn up by the conquering commander and a senatorial embassy. The <e>lex provinciae</e> laid down the organization of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="584578" tocid="">taxation</xref>, which varied from province to province.
            </p>
            <p>
              The provincial administrative apparatuses were minimal and unprofessional, as the Romans relied heavily on the local elites as mediators. Each year a senatorial magistrate was sent out to govern with nearly unfettered powers. Because initially the governors were usually praetors, the addition of new provinces required the election of more praetors (increased to four in 227 and to six in 197). The assignments to provinces were done by lot. The governor took with him one of the quaestors to oversee the finances of provincial <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="240105" tocid="">government</xref> and senatorial friends and relatives to serve as deputies and advisors (<e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="334911" tocid="">legati</xref>
              </e>). Among the humbler functionaries assisting the governor were scribes to keep records and lictors with fasces (bundles of rods and axes) to symbolize gubernatorial authority and to execute sentences pronounced by the governor in criminal cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The governor’s main duties were to maintain order and security and to collect revenues. The former often entailed command of an army to ward off external threats and to suppress internal disorders such as banditry. When not commanding his army, the governor spent his time hearing legal cases and arbitrating disputes. During the republic, revenue collection was left to private companies of <e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482582" tocid="">publicani</xref>
              </e>, so called because they won by highest bid the contract to collect the revenues. It was the governor’s responsibility to keep the <e>publicani</e> within the bounds of the <e>lex provinciae</e> so that they did not exploit the helpless provincials too mercilessly, but this was difficult. Governors expected to make a profit from their term of office, and some collaborated with the <e>publicani</e> to strip the provinces of their wealth.

Yet Rome’s very successes in the 2nd century undermined these features, leading to profound changes in the republic’s politics, culture, economy, and society.</p>

            </headtitle>
            <p>
              The Romans organized their citizenry in a way that permitted expansion. This was regarded as a source of strength by contemporaries such as Philip V, who noted that Rome replenished its citizen ranks with freed slaves. The extension of citizenship continued in the early 2nd century, as in the grant of full citizen rights to Arpinum, Formiae, and Fundi in 188. Yet Rome’s glittering successes made such openness ever more problematic. For one, the city attracted increasing numbers of Latins and allies, who wished to use their ancient right to migrate and take up Roman citizenship. The depletion of Latin and Italian towns prompted protests, until in 177 Rome took away the right of migration and forced Latin and Italian migrants to return to their hometowns to register for military service. Such measures were sporadically repeated in the following years. In addition, the flood of slaves into Rome from the great conquests increased the flow of foreign-born freedmen into the citizen body. Sempronius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="240424" tocid="">Gracchus</xref> (father of the famous <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="604799" tocid="">tribunes</xref>) won senatorial approbation as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="101964" tocid="">censor</xref> in 168 by registering the freedmen in a single urban tribe and thus limiting their electoral influence. Despite these efforts, the nature and meaning of Roman citizenship were bound to change, as the citizen body became ever more diffuse and lived dispersed from Rome, the only place where the right of suffrage could be exercised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polybius greatly admired Rome’s balanced constitution, with its elements of monarchy (magistrates), aristocracy (Senate), and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="157129" tocid="">democracy</xref> (popular assemblies). According to Greek political theory, each form of constitution was believed to be unstable and susceptible to decline until replaced by another. Yet Rome’s system of balance, Polybius thought, was a check on the cycle of decline. By forcing the Roman constitution into the mold of Greek political theory, however, he exaggerated the symmetry of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="108283" tocid="">checks and balances</xref>. In reality, the Senate enjoyed a period of steady domination through the first two-thirds of the 2nd century, having emerged from the Second Punic War with high prestige. Only occasionally did the developing tensions and contradictions surface during these decades.

            <p>
              Politics during the period was largely a matter of senatorial families competing for high office and the ensuing lucrative commands. Because offices were won in the centuriate and tribal assemblies, senators had to cultivate support among the <e>populus</e>. Yet the system was not as democratic as it might appear. Senators with illustrious names and consular ancestors dominated the election to the highest offices, increasing their share of the consulates from about one-half to two-thirds during the 2nd century. These proportions can be interpreted in two ways: the Senate was not a closed, hereditary aristocracy but was open to new families, who usually rose through the senatorial ranks in the course of generations with the patronal support of established families; yet a small circle of prominent families (<e>e.g.</e>, the Aemilii, Claudii, and Cornelii) were disproportionately successful, surprisingly so in view of the popular electoral process. Since the campaigning was not oriented toward issues, the great families were able to maintain their superiority over the centuries by their inherited resources: their famous names, their wealth, and their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121483" tocid="">clienteles</xref> of voters.
            </p>
            <p>
              While aristocratic electoral competition was tradition during the republic, this period began to exhibit the escalation in competitiveness that was later fatal to the republic. For example, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="529046" tocid="">Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus</xref> emerged from the Second Punic War as the Roman whose <e>dignitas</e> (prestige) far surpassed that of his peers. Nonetheless, a number of senators attacked him and his brother Lucius Cornelius with legal charges until he finally retired from Rome to end his life at his Campanian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="628966" tocid="">villa</xref> at Liternum. For younger senators, however, Scipio’s spectacular achievement was something to emulate. The ambitious young Flamininus moved swiftly through the senatorial <e>cursus honorum</e> (“course of honors”) to win the consulship and command against Philip V at the age of 30. Such cases prompted laws to regulate the senatorial <e>cursus</e>: iteration in the same magistracy was prohibited, the praetorship was made a prerequisite for the consulship, and in 180 the <e>lex Villia annalis</e> (Villian law on minimum ages) set minimum ages for senatorial magistrates and required a two-year interval between offices. The consulship (two elected to it per year) could be held from age 42, the praetorship (six per year) from age 39, and the curule aedileship from 36. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446617" tocid="">Patricians</xref>, still privileged in this area, were probably allowed to stand for these offices two years earlier. The senatorial career was preceded by 10 years of military service, from age 17, and formally began with a quaestorship, the most junior senatorial magistracy (eight per year), at age 30 or just under. The offices between the quaestorship and praetorship, the aedileship (four per year) and the plebeian tribunate (10 per year), were not compulsory but provided opportunities to win popularity among the voters by staging aedilician games and supporting popular causes, respectively. Here again, excess elicited restraint, and legal limits were placed on the lavishness of the games. More broadly, from 181 legislation designed to curb electoral <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="79186" tocid="">bribery</xref> was intermittently introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problems of electoral competition did not disappear. In the late 150s second consulships were prohibited altogether, but within decades the rules were broken. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="529059" tocid="">Scipio Aemilianus</xref>, grandson by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6298" tocid="">adoption</xref> of Scipio Africanus, challenged the system. Returning from the Carthaginian campaign to Rome to stand for the aedileship, he was elected instead to the consulship, even though he was underage and had not held the prerequisite praetorship. He was then elected to a second consulship for 134. Scipio had no subversive intent, but his career set the precedent for circumventing the <e>cursus</e> regulations by appeal to the popular assemblies.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the 2nd century was a time of heated competition among senators, it was generally a period of quiescence of the plebs and their magistrates, the tribunes. Nevertheless, signs of the upheaval ahead are visible. For one, the long plebeian struggle against arbitrary abuse of magisterial power continued. A series of Porcian laws were passed to protect citizens from summary execution or scourging, asserting the citizen’s right of appeal to the assembly (<e>ius provocationis</e>). A descendant of the Porcian clan later advertised these laws on coins as a victory for freedom. Moreover, the massive annual war effort provoked occasional resistance to military service. In 193 the tribunes started to investigate complaints about overly long military service. Interpreting this as a challenge to magisterial authority, the Senate responded with a declaration of an emergency levy, and the tribunes stopped their activity. In 151 the tribunes tried to protect some citizens from the levy for the unpopular war in Spain. A confrontation between the tribunes and the recruiting <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134489" tocid="">consuls</xref> ensued, in which the tribunes briefly imprisoned the consuls until a compromise relieved the crisis. The scene of tribunes taking consuls to jail was repeated in 138 during a period of renewed difficulties over recruiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the Hortensian law of 287, the plebs had the constitutional power to pass laws binding on the entire state without senatorial approval. During the next century and a half few attempts were made to use the power for purposes of major reform against the Senate’s will, in part because the plebeian tribunes, as members of the senatorial order, generally shared the Senate’s interests and in part because the plebeians benefited from Rome’s great successes abroad under senatorial leadership. Yet senatorial fear of unbridled popular legislative power is perceptible in the Aelian and Fufian law of about 150. This law, imperfectly known from later passing references, provided that a magistrate holding a legislative assembly could be prevented from passing a bill on religious grounds by another magistrate claiming to have witnessed unfavourable omens in a procedure called <e>obnuntiatio</e>. In addition, the days of the year on which legislative assemblies could be held were reduced. As conservative senators worked to restrain the democratic element in the political processes, the plebeians sought to expand their freedom. Voting in electoral and judicial assemblies had been public, allowing powerful senators more easily to manage the votes of their clients. The Gabinian law (139) and Cassian law (137) introduced secret written ballots into the assemblies, thus loosening the control of patrons over their clients. Significantly, the reform was supported by Scipio Aemilianus, the sort of senator who stood to benefit by attracting the clients of other patrons through his personal popularity. These reforms, together with the changing composition of the electorate in the city, carried the potential, soon to be realized, for more volatile assemblies.

              Expansion brought Rome into contact with many diverse cultures. The most important of these was the Greek culture in the eastern Mediterranean with its highly refined <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="343579" tocid="">literature</xref> and learning. Rome responded to it with ambivalence: although Greek <e>doctrina</e> was attractive, it was also the culture of the defeated and enslaved. Indeed, much Greek culture was brought to Rome in the aftermath of military victories, as Roman soldiers returned home not only with works of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="630806" tocid="">art</xref> but also with learned Greeks who had been enslaved. Despite the ambivalence, nearly every facet of Roman culture was influenced by the Greeks, and it was a Greco-Roman culture that the Roman empire bequeathed to later European civilization.
            </p>
            <p>As Roman aristocrats encountered Greeks in southern Italy and in the East in the 3rd century, they learned to speak and write in Greek. Scipio Africanus and Flamininus, for example, are known to have corresponded in Greek. By the late republic it became standard for senators to be bilingual. Many were reared from infancy by Greek-speaking slaves and later tutored by Greek slaves or freedmen. Nonetheless, despite their increasing fluency in Greek, senators continued to insist on Latin as the official language of government; visiting dignitaries from the East addressing the Senate in Greek had their speeches translated—as a mark of their subordination.</p>
            <p>
              Because Greek was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="342377" tocid="">lingua franca</xref> of the East, Romans had to use Greek if they wished to reach a wider audience. Thus the first histories by Romans were written in Greek. The patrician Fabius Pictor, who, as noted above, founded the Roman tradition of historiography during the Second Punic War, wrote his annalistic history of Rome in Greek partly in order to influence Greek views in favour of Rome, and he emphasized Rome’s ancient ties to the Greek world by incorporating in his history the legend that the Trojan hero Aeneas had settled in Latium. Because Roman history was about politics and war, the writing of history was always judged by Romans to be a suitable pastime for men of politics—<e>i.e.</e>, for senators such as Fabius.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rome had had a folk tradition of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="466108" tocid="">poetry</xref> in the native <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="525231" tocid="">Saturnian verse</xref> with a metre based on stress, but not a formal literature. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="344903" tocid="">Lucius Livius Andronicus</xref> was regarded as the father of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331905" tocid="">Latin literature</xref>, a fact that illustrates to what extent the development of Roman literature was bound up with conquest and enslavement. Livius, a native Greek speaker from Tarentum, was brought as a slave to Rome, where he remained until his death (<e>c.</e> 204). Becoming fluent in Latin, he translated the Homeric <e>Odyssey</e> into Latin in Saturnian verse. Thus <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331905" tocid="">Latin literature</xref> began with a translation from Greek into the native metre. Livius reached wider audiences through his translations of Greek plays for public performance. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="401487" tocid="">Gnaeus Naevius</xref>, the next major figure (<e>c.</e> 270–<e>c.</e> 201), was again not a native Roman but an Oscan speaker from Campania. In addition to translating Greek drama, he wrote the first major original work in Latin, an epic poem about the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483505" tocid="">First Punic War</xref>. Naevius’ successors, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="188565" tocid="">Quintus Ennius</xref> from Calabria (239–169) and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="597352" tocid="">Titus</xref> Maccius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="464334" tocid="">Plautus</xref> from Umbria (<e>c.</e> 254–184), transformed the Latin poetic genres by importing Greek metrical forms based on the length of syllables rather than on stress. Ennius was best known for his epic history of Rome in verse, the <e>Annales</e>, but he also wrote tragedies and satires. Plautus produced comedies adapted from Greek <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="411281" tocid="">New Comedy</xref>. He is the only early author whose work is well represented in the corpus of surviving literature (21 plays judged authentic by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="623569" tocid="">Marcus Terentius Varro</xref>, Rome’s greatest scholar). None of the plays of his younger contemporaries, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88030" tocid="">Caecilius Statius</xref> (<e>c.</e> 210–168) and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="437938" tocid="">Marcus Pacuvius</xref> (<e>c.</e> 220–130), survive, nor do the once highly esteemed tragedies of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="2980" tocid="">Lucius Accius</xref> (170–<e>c.</e> 86). The six extant comedies of Terence (Publius Terentius Afer; <e>c.</e> 190–159) provide a sense of the variation in the comic tradition of the 2nd century. These authors also were outsiders, coming from the Celtic Po valley, Brundisium, Umbria, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418538" tocid="">North Africa</xref>, respectively. Thus, while assorted foreigners, some of servile origin, established a Latin literature by adapting Greek genres, metrical forms, and content, native Roman senators began to write history in Greek.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other forms of Greek learning were slower to take root in Rome. Later Romans remembered that a Greek doctor established a practice in Rome for the first time just before the Second Punic War, but his reputation did little to stimulate Roman interest in the subject. Like doctors, Greek philosophers of the 2nd century were regarded with interest and suspicion. In the early 3rd century Romans had erected in public a statue of Pythagoras, a 6th-century Greek philosopher who had founded communities of philosophers in southern Italy. In the mid-2nd century some senators displayed an interest in philosophy. Scipio Aemilianus, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="327646" tocid="">Gaius Laelius</xref> (consul 140), and Lucius Furius Philus (consul 136) were among those who listened to the lectures of the three leaders of the Athenian philosophical schools visiting Rome on a diplomatic mission in 155—the academic Carneades, the peripatetic Critolaus, and the stoic Diogenes. On an official visit to the East in 140, Scipio included in his entourage the leading stoic Panaetius. In the same period, another stoic, Blossius of Cumae, was said to have influenced the reforming tribune <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="240427" tocid="">Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus</xref>. Yet the philosophical influence should not be exaggerated; none of these senators was a philosopher or even a formal student of philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, the sophisticated rhetoric of the philosophers—in 155 Carneades lectured in favour of natural justice one day and against it the next—was perceived by leading Romans such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99975" tocid="">Cato the Censor</xref> as subversive to good morals. At his urging the Senate quickly concluded the diplomatic business of Carneades, Critolaus, and Diogenes in 155 and hurried them out of Rome. This was part of a broader pattern of hostility to philosophy: in 181 the (spurious) Books of Numa, falsely believed to have been influenced by Pythagoras, were burned, and the following decades witnessed several expulsions of philosophers from the city. In comedies of the period, the discipline was held up for ridicule.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hostility toward philosophy was one aspect of a wider Roman sense of unease about changing mores. Cato, a “new man” (without senatorial ancestors) elected consul (195) and censor (184), represented himself as an austere champion of the old ways and exemplifies the hardening Roman reaction against change under foreign influence. Although Cato knew Greek and could deploy allusions to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244649" tocid="">Greek literature</xref>, he advised his son against too deep a knowledge of the literature of that “most worthless and unteachable race.” Cato despised those senatorial colleagues who ineptly imitated Greek manners. He asserted the value of Latin culture in the role of father of Latin prose literature. His treatise on estate management, the <e>De agricultura</e> (<e>c.</e> 160), has survived with its rambling discourse about how to run a 200-<e>iugera</e> (124-acre) farm, including advice on everything from buying and selling slaves to folk medicine. Cato’s greater, historical work, the <e>Origines</e>, survives only in fragments: it challenged the earlier Roman histories insofar as it was written in Latin and emphasized the achievements of the Italian peoples rather than those of the few great senatorial families of Rome (whose names were conspicuously omitted).
            </p>
            <p>
              Elected censor in 184 to protect Roman mores, Cato vowed “to cut into pieces and burn like a hydra all luxury and voluptuousness.” He expelled seven men from the Senate on various charges of immorality and penalized through taxation the acquisition of such luxuries as expensive clothing, jewelry, carriages, and fancy slaves. The worry about luxury was widespread, as evidenced by the passage of a series of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573467" tocid="">sumptuary laws</xref> supported by Cato. During the depths of the Second Punic War the Oppian law (215) was passed to meet the financial crisis by restricting the jewelry and clothing women were allowed to wear; in 195, after the crisis, the law was repealed despite Cato’s protests. Later sumptuary laws were motivated not by military crisis but by a sense of the dangers of luxury: the Orchian law (182) limited the lavishness of banquets; the Fannian law (161) strengthened the Orchian provisions, and the Didian law (143) extended the limits to all Italy. A similar sense of the dangers of wealth may also have prompted the <e>lex Voconia</e> (169), which prohibited Romans of the wealthiest class from naming women as heirs in their wills.
            </p>
            <p>
              The laws and censorial actions ultimately could not restrain changes in Roman mores. Economic conditions had been irreversibly altered by conquest; the magnitude of conspicuous consumption is suggested by a senatorial decree of 161 that restricted the weight of silver tableware in a banquet to 100 pounds—10 times the weight for which Publius Cornelius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="512347" tocid="">Rufinus</xref> was punished in 275. Moreover, the very competitiveness that had traditionally marked the senatorial aristocracy ensured the spread of cultural innovations and new forms of conspicuous consumption among the elite. In contrast to the austere Cato, other senators laid claim to prestige by collecting Greek art and books brought back by conquering armies, by staging plays modeled on Greek drama, and by commissioning literary works, public buildings, and private sculptural monuments in a Greek style.
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the influence of Greek high culture was felt principally in a small circle of elite Romans who had the wealth to acquire Greek art and slaves and the leisure and education to read Greek authors, the influence of religions from the eastern Mediterranean was perceived as potentially subversive to a far wider audience. Polybius praised the Romans for their conscientious behaviour toward the gods. Romans were famous for their extreme precision in recitation of vows and performance of sacrifices to the gods, meticulously repeating archaic words and actions centuries after their original meanings had been forgotten. Guiding these state cults were priestly colleges; and priestly offices such as of pontifex and augur were filled by senators, whose dominance in politics was thus replicated in civic religion.</p>
            <p>
              In earlier centuries Rome’s innate religious conservatism was, however, counterbalanced by an openness to foreign gods and cults. As Rome incorporated new peoples of Italy into its citizen body, it accepted their gods and religious practices. Indeed, among the most authoritative religious texts, consulted in times of crisis or doubt, were the prophetic Sibylline Books, written in Greek and imported from Cumae. The receptivity appears most pronounced in the 3rd century: during its final decades temples were built in the city for Venus Erycina from Sicily and for the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="243491" tocid="">Magna Mater</xref>, or Great Mother, from Pessinus in Anatolia; games were instituted in honour of the Greek god <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="29868" tocid="">Apollo</xref> (212) and the Magna Mater after the war. The new cults were integrated into the traditional structure of the state religion, and the “foreignness” was controlled (<e>i.e.</e>, limits were placed on the orgiastic elements in the cult of the Great Mother performed by her eunuch priests).
            </p>
            <p>
              The openness, never complete or a matter of principle, tilted toward resistance in the early 2nd century. In 186 Roman magistrates, on orders from the Senate, brutally suppressed Bacchic worship in Italy. Associations of worshipers of the Greek god Bacchus (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="164280" tocid="">Dionysus</xref>) had spread across Italy to Rome. Their members, numbering in the thousands, were initiated into secret mysteries, knowledge of which promised life after death; they also engaged in orgiastic worship. The secrecy soon gave rise to reports of the basest activities, such as uncontrolled drinking, sexual promiscuity, forgery of wills, and poisoning of kin. According to Livy, more than 7,000 were implicated in the wrongdoing; many of them were tried and executed, and the consuls destroyed the places of Bacchic worship throughout Italy. For the future, the (extant) senatorial decree prohibited men from acting as priests in the cult, banned secret meetings, and required the praetor’s and Senate’s authorization of ceremonies to be performed by gatherings of more than five people. The terms of the decree provide a sense of what provoked the harsh senatorial reaction. It was not that the Bacchic cult spread heretical beliefs about the gods—Roman civic religion was never based on theological doctrine with pretensions to exclusive truth; rather, the growing secret cult led by male priests threatened the traditionally dominant position of senators in state religion. The decree did not aim to eliminate Bacchic worship but to bring it under the supervision of senatorial authorities. The following centuries witnessed sporadic official actions against foreign cults; it happens to be recorded that a praetor of 139 removed private altars built in public areas and expelled astrologers and Jews from the city. Thus the reaction to eastern religions paralleled that to Greek philosophy; both were perceived as new ways of thinking that threatened to undermine traditional mores and the relations of authority implicit in them.

            <headtitle>Demographic and economic developments</headtitle>
            <p>
              It seems certain that the economy and society of Italy were transformed in the wake of Rome’s conquest of the Mediterranean world, even though the changes can be described only incompletely and imprecisely, owing to the dearth of reliable information for the preceding centuries. Romans of the 1st century <e ty="s">bc</e> believed that their ancestors had been a people of small farmers in an age uncorrupted by wealth. Even senators who performed heroic feats were said to have been of modest means—men such as Lucius Quinctius Cinncinatus, who was said to have laid down his plow on his tiny farm to serve as dictator in 458 <e ty="s">bc</e>. Although such legends present an idealized vision of early Rome, it is probably true that Latium of the 5th and 4th centuries was densely populated by farmers of small plots. Rome’s military strength derived from its superior resources of manpower levied from a pool of small landowning citizens (<e>assidui</e>). A dense population is also suggested by the emigration from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="332009" tocid="">Latium</xref> of scores of thousands as colonists during the 4th and 3rd centuries. The legends of senators working their own fields seem implausible, but the disparity in wealth was probably much less noticeable than in the late republic. The 4th-century artifacts uncovered by archaeologists display an overall high quality that makes it difficult to distinguish a category of luxury goods from the pottery and terra-cottas made for common use.
            </p>
            <p>
              War and conquest altered this picture; yet certain fundamental features of the economy remained constant. Until its fall, the Roman Empire retained agriculture as the basis of its economy, with probably four-fifths of the population tilling the soil. This great majority continued to be needed in food production because there were no labour-saving technological breakthroughs. The power driving agricultural and other production was almost entirely supplied by humans and animals, which set modest limits to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178400" tocid="">economic growth</xref>. In some areas of Italy, such as the territory of Capena in southern Etruria, archaeologists have found traditional patterns of settlement and land division continuing from the 4th to the end of the 1st century—evidence that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483518" tocid="">Second Punic War</xref> and the following decades did not bring a complete break with the past.
            </p>
            <p>Economic change came as a result of massive population shifts and the social reorganization of labour rather than technological improvement. The Second Punic War, and especially Hannibal’s persistent presence in Italy, inflicted a considerable toll, including loss of life on a staggering scale, movement of rural populations into towns, and destruction of agriculture in some regions. Although the devastation has been overestimated by some historians, partial depopulation of the Italian countryside is evident from the literary and archaeological records: immediately after the war enough land stood vacant in Apulia and Samnium to settle between 30,000 and 40,000 of Scipio’s veterans, while areas of Apulia, Bruttium, southern Campania, and south-central Etruria have yielded no artifacts indicating settlement in the postwar period.</p>
            <p>Populations have been known to show great resilience in recovering from wars, but the Italian population was given no peace after 201. In subsequent decades Rome’s annual war effort required a military mobilization unmatched in history for its duration and the proportion of the population involved. During the 150 years after Hannibal’s surrender, the Romans regularly fielded armies of more than 100,000 men, requiring on average about 13 percent of the adult male citizens each year. The attested casualties from 200 to 150 add up to nearly 100,000. The levy took Roman peasants away from their land. Many never returned. Others, perhaps 25,000, were moved in the years before 173 from peninsular Italy to the colonies of the Po valley. Still others, in unknown but considerable numbers, migrated to the cities. By the later 2nd century some Roman leaders perceived the countryside to be depopulated.</p>
            <p>
              To replace the peasants on the land of central and southern Italy, slaves were imported in vast numbers. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="548305" tocid="">Slavery</xref> was well established as a form of agricultural labour before the Punic Wars (slaves must have produced much of the food during the peak mobilization of citizens from 218 to 201). The scale of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="548305" tocid="">slavery</xref>, however, increased in the 2nd and 1st centuries as a result of conquests. Enslavement was a common fate for the defeated in ancient warfare: the Romans enslaved 5,000 Macedonians in 197; 5,000 Histri in 177; 150,000 Epirotes in 167; 50,000 Carthaginians in 146; and in 174 an unspecified number of Sardinians, but so many that “Sardinian” became a byword for “cheap” slave. These are only a few examples for which the sources happen to give numbers. More slaves flooded into Italy after Rome destabilized the eastern Mediterranean in 167 and gave pirates and bandits the opportunity to carry off local peoples of Anatolia and sell them on the block at Delos by the thousands. By the end of the republic Italy was a thoroughgoing slave society with well over one million slaves, according to the best estimates. No census figures give numbers of slaves, but slaveholding was more widespread and on a larger scale than in the antebellum American South, where slaves made up about one-third of the population. In effect, Roman soldiers fought in order to capture their own replacements on the land in Italy, although the shift from free to servile labour was only a partial one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The influx of slaves was accompanied by changes in patterns of landownership, as more Italian land came to be concentrated in fewer hands. One of the punishments meted out to disloyal allies after the Second Punic War was confiscation of all or part of their territories. Most of the <e>ager Campanus</e> and part of the Tarentines’ lands—perhaps two million acres in total—became Roman <e>ager publicus</e> (public land), subject to rent. Some of this property remained in the hands of local peoples, but large tracts in excess of the 500-<e>iugera</e> limit were occupied by wealthy Romans, who were legally <e>possessores</e> (<e>i.e.</e>, in possession of the land, although not its owners) and as such paid a nominal rent to the Roman state. The trend toward concentration continued during the 2nd century, propelled by conquests abroad. On the one side, subsistence farmers were always vulnerable in years of poor harvests that could lead to debt and ultimately to the loss of their plots. The vulnerability was exacerbated by army service, which took peasants away from their farms for years at a time. On the other side, the elite orders were enriched by the booty from the eastern kingdoms on a scale previously unimaginable. Some of the vast new wealth was spent on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482523" tocid="">public works</xref> and on new forms of luxury and part was invested to secure future income. Land was the preferred form of investment for senators and other honourable men: farming was regarded as safer and more prestigious than manufacture or trade. For senators, the opportunities for trade were limited by the Claudian law of 218 prohibiting them from owning large ships. Wealthy Romans thus used the proceeds of war to buy out their smaller neighbours. As a result of this process of acquisition, most senatorial estates consisted of scattered small farms. The notorious <e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331650" tocid="">latifundia</xref>
              </e>, the extensive consolidated estates, were not widespread. Given the dispersion of the property, the new landlord was typically absentee. He could leave the working of the farms in the hands of the previous peasant owners as tenants, or he could import slaves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best insights into the mentality of the estate-owning class of this period come from Cato’s <e>De agricultura</e>. Although based on Greek handbooks discussing estate management, it reflects the assumptions and thinking of a 2nd-century senator. Cato envisaged a medium-sized, 200-<e>iugera</e> farm with a permanent staff of 11 slaves. As with other Roman enterprises, management of the farm was left to a slave bailiff, who was helped by his slave wife. While Cato, like the later agricultural writers Varro and Lucius Junius Columella, assumed the economic advantage of a slave <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="326796" tocid="">work force</xref>, historians today debate whether estates worked by slaves were indeed more profitable than smaller peasant farms. Cato had his slaves use much the same <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="585418" tocid="">technology</xref> as the peasants, although a larger estate could afford large processing implements, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="241944" tocid="">grape</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427691" tocid="">olive</xref> crushers, which peasants might have to share or do without. Nor did Cato bring to bear any innovative management advice; his suggestions aimed to maximize profits by such commonsense means as keeping the slave work force occupied all year round and buying cheap and selling dear. Nevertheless, larger estates had one significant advantage in that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="213151" tocid="">slave labour</xref> could be bought and sold and thus more easily matched to labour needs than was possible on small plots worked by peasant families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cato’s farm was a model representing one aspect of the reality of the Italian countryside. Archaeologists have discovered the villas characteristic of the Catonian estate beginning to appear in Campania in the 2nd century and later in other areas. The emergence of slave agriculture did not exclude the continuing existence in the area of peasants as owners of marginal land or as casual day labourers or both. The larger estates and the remaining peasants formed a symbiotic relationship, mentioned by Cato: the estate required extra hands to help during peak seasons, while the peasants needed the extra wages from day labour to supplement the meagre production of their plots. Yet in many areas of Italy the villa system made no inroads during the republic, and traditional peasant farming continued. Other areas, however, underwent a drastic change: the desolation left by the Second Punic War in the central and southern regions opened the way for wealthy Romans to acquire vast tracts of depopulated land to convert to grazing. This form of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="198903" tocid="">extensive agriculture</xref> produced cattle, sheep, and goats, herded by slaves. These were the true <e>latifundia</e>, decried as wastelands by Roman imperial authors such as the elder Pliny.
            </p>
            <p>
              The marketplace took on a new importance as both the Catonian estate and the <e>latifundium</e> aimed primarily to produce goods to sell for a profit. In this sense, they represented a change from peasant agriculture, which aimed above all to feed the peasant’s family. The buyers of the new commodities were the growing cities—another facet of the complex economic transformation. Rome was swelled by migrants from the countryside and became the largest city of preindustrial Europe, with a population of about one million in the imperial era; other Italian cities grew to a lesser extent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mass of consumers created new, more diverse demands for foodstuffs from the countryside and also for manufactured goods. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365647" tocid="">market</xref> was bipolar, with the poor of the cities able to buy only basic foodstuffs and a few plain manufactured items and the rich demanding increasingly extravagant luxury goods. The limitations of the poor are reflected in the declining quality of humble temple offerings. The craftsmen and traders produced mainly for the rich minority. The trading and artisanal enterprises in Rome were largely worked by slaves and freedmen imported to Rome by the wealthy. Although honourable, freeborn Romans considered it beneath their dignity to participate directly in these businesses, they willingly shared in the profits through ownership of these slaves and through collection of rents on the shops of humbler men. Thus, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="849534" tocid="">manufacturing</xref> and trading were generally small-scale operations, organized on the basis of household or family. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref> did not recognize business corporations with the exception of publican companies holding state contracts; nor were there guilds of the medieval type to organize or control production. Unlike some later medieval cities, Rome did not produce for export to support itself; its revenues came from booty, provincial taxes, and the surplus brought from the countryside to the city by aristocratic Roman landlords. Indeed, after 167 provincial revenues were sufficient to allow for the abolition of direct taxes on Roman citizens.
            </p>
            <p>Building projects were the largest enterprises in Rome and offered freeborn immigrants jobs as day labourers. In addition to the private building needed to house the growing population, the early and middle 2nd century witnessed public building on a new scale and in new shapes. The leading senatorial families gained publicity by sponsoring major new buildings named after themselves in the Forum and elsewhere. The Basilica Porcia (built during Marcus Porcius Cato’s censorship of 184), the Basilica Aemilia et Fulvia (179), and the Basilica Sempronia (170–169) were constructed out of the traditional tufa blocks but in a Hellenized style.</p>
            <p>
              New infrastructures were required to bring the necessities of life to the growing population. The Porticus Aemilia (193), a warehouse of 300,000 square feet on the banks of the Tiber, illustrates how the new needs were met with a major new building technology, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131278" tocid="">concrete</xref> construction. Around 200 <e ty="s">bc</e> in central Italy it was discovered that a wet mixture of crushed stone, lime, and sand (especially a volcanic sand called <e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473488" tocid="">pozzolana</xref>
              </e>) would set into a material of great strength. This construction technique had great advantages of economy and flexibility over the traditional cut-stone technique: the materials were more readily available, the concrete could be molded into desired shapes, and the molds could be reused for repetitive production. The Porticus Aemilia, for example, consisted of a series of roughly identical arches and vaults—the shapes so characteristic of later Roman <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32876" tocid="">architecture</xref>. The new technology also permitted improvements in the construction of the aqueducts needed to increase the city’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="637293" tocid="">water supply</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The economic development outside of Rome encompassed some fairly large-scale manufacturing enterprises and export trade. At <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473499" tocid="">Puteoli</xref> on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="402901" tocid="">Bay of Naples</xref> the ironworks <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="287256" tocid="">industry</xref> was organized on a scale well beyond that of the household, and its goods were shipped beyond the area. Puteoli flourished during the republic as a port city, handling imports destined for Rome as well as exports of manufactured goods and processed agricultural products. In their search for markets, the large Italian landowners exported wine and olive oil to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118628" tocid="">Cisalpine Gaul</xref> and more distant locations. Dressel I amphoras, the three-foot pottery jars carrying these products, have been found in substantial quantities in Africa and Gaul. Yet the magnitude of the economic development should not be exaggerated: the ironworks industry was exceptional, and most pottery production continued to be for local use.

            <headtitle>Social changes</headtitle>
            <p>
              Major social changes and dislocations accompanied the demographic shifts and economic development. Relations between rich and poor in Rome had traditionally been structured by the bond existing between patron and client. In the daily morning ritual of the <e>salutatio</e>, humble Romans went to pay their respects in the houses of senators, who were obligated to protect them. These personal relationships lent stability to the social hierarchy. In the 2nd century, however, the disparity between rich and poor citizens grew. While this trend increased the personal power of individual senators, it weakened the social control of the elite as a whole; the poor had become too numerous to be controlled by the traditional bond of patron and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121483" tocid="">client</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until the end of the 170s the impoverishment of humble citizens had been counterbalanced to some extent by the founding of colonies, because dispossessed peasants were given new lands in outlying regions. During the middle decades of the 2nd century, however, colonization ceased, and the number of dispossessed increased, to judge from the declining number of small landowners in the census. The problem created by a growing proletariat was recognized by a few senators. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="327646" tocid="">Gaius Laelius</xref>, probably during his consulship of 140, proposed a scheme of land redistribution to renew the class of smallholders, but it was rejected by the Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the dispossessed went to Rome, where, together with the increasing numbers of slaves and freedmen, they contributed to the steadily growing population. This density led to the miseries associated with big cities, which were exacerbated by the absence of regulation. By 200 <e ty="s">bc</e> the pressure of numbers necessitated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="29370" tocid="">apartment buildings</xref> of three stories. Constructed without a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="83856" tocid="">building code</xref>, these structures were often unsound and prone to collapse. Moreover, closely placed and partly made of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="647253" tocid="">wood</xref>, they were tinderboxes, ever ready to burst into flame. The population density also increased the vulnerability to food shortages and plagues. In 188 fines were levied against dealers for withholding grain, attesting to problems of supply. The 180s and 170s witnessed repeated outbreaks of plague. The state, which could use its power to increase the grain supply, was helpless against diseases. In general, the republican state developed few new institutions to manage the growing urban problems: until the reign of Augustus matters were left to the traditional authority of urban magistrates, who were unaided by a standing <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="207834" tocid="">fire brigade</xref> or police force. Consequently, Rome held an increasing potential for social discontent and conflicts without a corresponding increase in means of control.
            </p>
            <p>
              The family, regarded by Romans as a mainstay of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social order</xref>, also was affected by the wider economic and social transformations of the 2nd century <e ty="s">bc</e>. In the early republic the family had formed a social, economic, and legal unity. The woman generally married into her husband’s family and came under his legal authority (or that of his father if he was still alive), and her dowry merged with the rest of the estate under the ownership of the husband. The husband managed the family’s affairs outside the house, while the wife was custodian within. Marriage was an arrangement for life; divorces were rare and granted only in cases of serious moral infractions, such as adultery or wine-tippling on the part of the wife. The children of the couple were subject to the father’s nearly absolute legal powers (<e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446579" tocid="">patria potestas</xref>
              </e>), including the power of life and death, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="138384" tocid="">corporal punishment</xref>, and a monopoly of ownership of all property in the family. The father’s power lasted until his death or, in the case of a daughter, until her marriage. When the father died, his sons, his wife, and his unmarried daughters became legally independent, and all inherited equal shares of the family’s property unless otherwise specified in a will. The imperial authors idealized the early republic as a time of family harmony and stability, which was lost through the corruption of the later republic.
            </p>
            <p>
              When family life emerged into the full light of history in the 2nd century <e ty="s">bc</e>, it had changed in significant ways. A form of marriage, commonly called “free marriage,” was becoming prevalent. Under this form, the wife no longer came into her husband’s power or property regime but remained in that of her father; upon her father’s death she became independent with rights to own and dispose of property. But she was not a member of the family of her husband and children and had no claim to inheritance from them, even though she lived with them in the same house. Because many women inherited part of their fathers’ estates, they could use their independent fortunes to exert influence on husbands, children, and people outside the house. In the same period divorce became far more common; moral infractions were no longer needed to justify divorce, which could be initiated by either side. Frequent divorce and remarriage went hand in hand with the separation of marital property. There is plausibility in the suggestion that these changes were brought on by a desire of the women’s fathers to avoid having their daughters’ portions of the larger family estates slip irrevocably into the hands of their husbands. Although the changes in law and practice were not motivated by any movement to emancipate women, the result was that propertied women of the late republic, always excluded from the public sphere of male citizens, came to enjoy a degree of freedom and social power unusual before the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>Slaves came to permeate the fabric of family life and altered relationships within the household. They were regularly assigned the tasks of child-rearing, traditionally the domain of the mother, and of education, until then the responsibility of both the father and the mother. Whereas children had acquired the skills needed for their future roles by observing their parents in a kind of apprenticeship, in wealthy houses sons and, to a lesser extent, daughters were now given a specialized education by slaves or freedmen. The management of aristocratic households was entrusted to slaves and freedmen, who served as secretaries, accountants, and managers. The wife was no longer needed as custodian of the household, though domestic guardianship remained an element in the idealization of her role. Later moralists attributed a decline in Roman virtue and discipline to the intrusion of slaves into familial relationships and duties.</p>

            <headtitle>Rome and Italy</headtitle>
            <p>During the middle republic the peoples of Italy began to coalesce into a fairly homogeneous and cohesive society. Polybius, however, does not give insight into this process, because, living in Rome, he too little appreciated the variety of Italian cultures under Roman sway, from the Gallic peoples in the mountains of the north to the urbane Greeks on the southern coasts. Other evidence, though meagre, nonetheless suggests several processes that contributed to the increasing cohesion.</p>
            <p>
              First, the Romans built a network of roads that facilitated communication across Italy. As stated above, the first great road was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30587" tocid="">Via Appia</xref>, which was laid out by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120520" tocid="">Appius Claudius Caecus</xref> in 312 to connect Rome to Capua. Between the First and Second Punic Wars roads were built to the north: the Via Aurelia (241?) along the Tyrrhenian coast, the Via Flaminia (220) through Umbria, and the Via Clodia through Etruria. Then, in the 2nd century, Roman presence in the Po valley was consolidated by the Via Aemilia (187) from Ariminum on the Adriatic coast to the Latin colony of Placentia and by the Via Postumia (148) running through Transpadane Gaul to Aquileia in the east and Genua in the west.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, internal migration—Italians moving to Rome and Romans being sent to Latin <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="126237" tocid="">colonies</xref> throughout Italy—promoted social and cultural homogeneity. Some of these colonies were set alongside existing settlements; others were founded on new sites. The colonies re-created the physical and social shape of Rome; the town plans and architecture, with forums including temples to Jupiter, were modeled on those of Rome. The imposition of a Latin colony on the Greek city of Paestum in Lucania (273) entailed the implantation of a Roman-style <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="214381" tocid="">forum</xref> in the centre of the existing city in a way that rudely intruded on the old sanctuary of Hera. The initial system governing the distribution of land to Latin colonists aimed to replicate the Roman social hierarchy differentiated by wealth: it is recorded of the colonists sent to Aquileia in 181 that the 3,000 infantrymen each received 50 <e>iugera</e> (31 acres), the centurions 100 <e>iugera</e> (62 acres), and the cavalrymen 140 <e>iugera</e> (86 acres). The unifying effect of the colonies is evident in Paestum’s notable loyalty to Rome during the Second Punic War.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third, although Rome did not seek to govern Italy through a regular administration, it influenced local affairs through formal bonds of personal friendship (<e>amicitia</e>) and hospitality (<e>hospitium</e>) between the Roman elite and their local counterparts. Through these ties the leading men of Italy were gradually drawn into the ruling class in Rome. The most prominent example of the 2nd century is that of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365552" tocid="">Gaius Marius</xref> of Arpinum, who, only two generations after his town had received full citizen rights, began his meteoric senatorial career under the patronage of the great Roman nobles, the Metelli.
            </p>
            <p>Fourth, the regular military campaigns brought together Romans and Italians of all classes under the command of Roman magistrates. The Italian troops appear to have been levied in a fashion similar to the one used for the Romans, which would have required a Roman-style census as a means of organizing the local citizenries. In the absence of direct administration, military service was the context in which Italians most regularly experienced Roman authority.</p>
            <p>
              Fifth, Rome occasionally deployed its troops in Italy to maintain social order. Rome suppressed an uprising of serfs in Etruscan <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="632409" tocid="">Volsinii</xref> in 265 and a sedition in Patavium in 175. When the massive influx of slaves raised the spectre of rebellions across Italy, Roman troops were deployed to put down uprisings: in 195, 5,000 slaves were executed in Latin Setia; in 196 the praetor was sent with his urban legion to Etruria to fight a pitched battle in which many slaves were killed; and the praetor of 185 dealt with rebellious slaves in Apulia, condemning 7,000 to death. The later slave revolt in Sicily (<e>c.</e> 135–132) was not contained so effectively and grew to include perhaps 70,000. The slaves defeated the first consular army sent in 134; the efforts of two more consuls were required to restore order. The revolts, unusual for their frequency and size, are not to be explained by abolitionist programs (nonexistent in antiquity) nor by maltreatment. The causes lay in the enslavement and importation of entire communities with their native leadership and in the free reign given to slave shepherds who roamed armed around the countryside serving as communication lines between slave plantations. These uprisings made it clear that the social fabric of Italy, put under stress by the transformations brought about by conquest, had to be protected by Roman force.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exercise of Roman authority and force was sometimes resented by Italians, Rome’s power made its mores and culture worthy of imitation. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331848" tocid="">Latin language</xref> and Roman political institutions slowly spread. A request from the old Campanian city of Cumae in 180 that it be allowed to change its official language from Oscan to Latin was a sign of things to come.

              The fall of Carthage and Corinth did not even mark a temporary end to warfare. War and military glory were an essential part of the Roman aristocratic ethos and, hence, of Roman political life. Apart from major wars still to come, small wars on the frontiers of Roman power—never precisely fixed—continued to provide an essential motive in Roman history: in Spain, Sardinia, Illyria, and Macedonia, barbarians could be defeated and triumphs won. Thus the limits of Roman power were gradually extended and the territories within them pacified, while men of noble stock rivaled the <e>virtus</e> of their ancestors and new men staked their own competing claims, winning glory essential to political advancement and sharing the booty with their officers and soldiers. Cicero could still depict it as a major disgrace for Lucius Piso (consul; 58 <e ty="s">bc</e>) that he had won no triumph in the traditionally “triumphal” province of Macedonia. Nonetheless, the coincidence of the capture of Corinth and Carthage was even in antiquity regarded as a turning point in Roman history: it was the end (for the time being) of warfare against civilized powers, in which the danger was felt to be greater and the glory and the booty were superior to those won against barbarian tribes.

            <h3 tocid="26625">
              <headtitle>Changes in provincial administration</headtitle>
              <p>
                The first immediate effect was on the administration of the empire. The military basis of provincial administration remained: the governor (as he is called) was in Roman eyes a commander with absolute and unappealable powers over all except Roman citizens, within the limits of the territory (his <e>provincia</e>) assigned to him (normally) by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="534333" tocid="">Senate</xref>. He was always prepared—and in some provinces expected—to fight and win. But it had been found that those unlimited powers were often abused and that Senate control could not easily be asserted at increasing distances from Rome. For political and perhaps for moral reasons, excessive abuse without hope of a remedy could not be permitted. Hence, when the decision to annex Carthage and Macedonia had been made in principle (149 <e ty="s">bc</e>), a permanent court (the <e>quaestio repetundarum</e>) was established at Rome to hear complaints against former commanders and, where necessary, to assure repayment of illegal exactions. No penalty for offenders was provided, and there was no derogation from the commander’s powers during his tenure; nevertheless, the step was a landmark in the recognition of imperial responsibility, and it was also to have important effects on Roman politics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another result of the new conquests was a major administrative departure. When Africa and Macedonia became <e>provinciae</e> to be regularly assigned to commanders, it was decided to break with precedent by not increasing the number of senior magistrates (praetors). Instead, prorogation—the device of leaving a magistrate in office <e>pro magistratu</e> (“in place of a magistrate”) after his term had expired, which had hitherto been freely used when emergencies had led to shortages of regular commanders—was established as part of the administrative system: thenceforth, every year at least two praetors would have to be retained as promagistrates. This was the beginning of the dissociation between urban magistracy and foreign command that was to become a cardinal principle of the system of Sulla and of the developed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507739" tocid="">Roman Empire</xref>.

Moreover, the end of large-scale booty led to economic recession in Rome, thus intensifying poverty and discontent. But the underlying crisis had been building up over a long period.</p>

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="594862" tocid="">Tiberius</xref> Gracchus, grandson of Scipio Africanus and son of the Gracchus who had conquered the Celtiberi and treated them well, was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="485995" tocid="">quaestor</xref> in Mancinus’ army when it faced annihilation; on the strength of his <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="575298" tocid="">family name</xref>, he personally negotiated the peace that saved it. When the Senate—on the motion of his cousin <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="529059" tocid="">Scipio Aemilianus</xref>, who later finished the war—renounced the peace, Tiberius felt aggrieved; he joined a group of senior senators hostile to Aemilianus and with ideas on reform. Elected tribune for 133, in Scipio’s absence, Tiberius attempted to find a solution for the social and military crisis, with the political credit to go to himself and his backers. Tiberius had no intention of touching private property; his idea was to enforce the legal but widely ignored limit of 500 <e>iugera</e> (309 acres) on occupation of public land and to use the land thus retrieved for settling landless citizens, who would both regain a secure living and be liable for service. The slave war in Sicily, which had lasted several years and had threatened to spread to Italy, had underlined both the danger of using large numbers of slaves on the land and the need for a major increase in military citizen manpower.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tiberius’ proposal was bound to meet with opposition in the Senate, which consisted of large landowners. On the advice of his eminent backers, he took his bill—which made various concessions to those asked to obey the law and hand back excess public land—straight to the Assembly of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="464495" tocid="">Plebs</xref>, where it found wide support. This procedure was not revolutionary; bills directly concerning the people appear to have been frequently passed in this way. But his opponents persuaded another aristocratic tribune, Marcus Octavius, to veto the bill. Tiberius tried the constitutional riposte: an appeal to the Senate for arbitration. But the Senate was unwilling to help, and Octavius was unwilling to negotiate over his veto—an action apparently unprecedented, though not (strictly speaking) unconstitutional. Tiberius had to improvise a way out of the impasse. He met Octavius’ action with a similarly unprecedented retort and had Octavius deposed by the Assembly. He then passed his bill in a less conciliatory form and had himself, his father-in-law, and his brother appointed commissioners with powers to determine boundaries of public land, confiscate excess acreage, and divide it in inalienable allotments among landless citizens. As it happened, envoys from Pergamum had arrived to inform the Senate that Attalus III had died and made the Roman people his heirs (provided the cities of his kingdom were left free). Tiberius, at whose house the envoys were lodging, anticipated Senate debate and had the inheritance accepted by the people and the money used to finance his agrarian schemes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tiberius’ opponents now charged him with aiming at tyranny, a charge that many may well have believed: redistribution of land was connected with demagogic tyranny in Hellenistic states, and Tiberius’ subsequent actions had been high-handed and beyond the flexible borderline of what was regarded as <e>mos majorum</e> (constitutional custom). Fearing prosecution once his term in office was over, he now began to canvass for a second tribunate—another unprecedented act, bound to reinforce fears of tyranny. The elections took place in an atmosphere of violence, with nearly all his tribunician colleagues now opposed to him. When the consul <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="526254" tocid="">Publius Scaevola</xref>, on strict legal grounds, refused to act against him, Publius Scipio Nasica, the chief pontiff, led a number of senators and their clients to the Assembly, and Tiberius was killed in a resulting scuffle. Widespread and bloody repression followed in 132. Thus political murder and political martyrdom were introduced into Roman politics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The land commission, however, was allowed to continue because it could not easily be stopped. Some evidence of its activities survives. By 129, perhaps running out of available land held by citizens, it began to apply the Gracchan law to public land held by Italian individuals or communities. This had probably not been envisaged by Tiberius, just as he did not include noncitizens among the beneficiaries of distributions. The Senate, on the motion of Scipio Aemilianus, upheld the Italians’ protests, transferring decisions concerning Italian-held land from the commission to a consul. This seriously hampered the commission’s activities. Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, chairman of the commission and consul in 125, tried to solve the problem by offering the Italians the citizenship (or alternatively the right to appeal against Roman executive acts to the Roman people) in return for bringing their holdings of public land under the Gracchan law. This aroused fears of uncontrollable political repercussions. Flaccus was ordered by the Senate to fight a war in southern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="215768" tocid="">France</xref> (where he gained a triumph) and had to abandon his proposal. There is no sign of widespread Italian interest in it at this time, though the revolt of the Latin colony Fregellae (destroyed 125) may be connected with its failure.

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                In 123 Gaius Gracchus, a younger brother of Tiberius, became tribune. He had served on Tiberius’ land commission and had supported Flaccus’ plan. Making the most of his martyred brother’s name, Gaius embarked on a scheme of general reform in which, for the first time in Rome, Greek theoretical influences may be traced. Among many reforms—including provision for a stable and cheap wheat price and for the foundation of colonies (one on the site of Carthage), to which Italians were admitted—two major ideas stand out: to increase public revenues (both from the empire and from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="584578" tocid="">taxes</xref>) and pass the benefit on to the people; and to raise the wealthiest nonsenators (particularly the equites, holders of the “public horse”—who received state financial aid for the purchase and upkeep of their horses—and next to senators in social standing) to a position from which, without actually taking part in the process of government, they could watch over senatorial administration and make it more responsible. The idea was evoked by Tiberius’ death. As early as 129 a law compelled senators to surrender the “public horse” (which hitherto they had also held) and possibly in other ways enhanced the group consciousness and privileges of the equites. Regarding the increase of public revenue, Gaius put the <e>publicani</e> (public contractors, hitherto chiefly concerned with army and building contracts and with farming minor taxes) in charge of the main tax of Asia—a rich province formed out of Attalus’ inheritance, which would henceforth provide Rome with the major part of its income. This was expected both to reduce senatorial corruption and to improve efficiency. Gaius also put eminent nonsenators (probably defined by wealth, but perhaps limited to the equites, or equestrian class) in charge of the <e>quaestio repetundarum</e>, whose senatorial members had shown too much leniency to their colleagues, and he imposed severe penalties on senators convicted by that court. Finally, in a second tribunate, he hoped to give citizenship to Latins and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308669" tocid="">Latin rights</xref> to other Italians, with the help of Flaccus who, though a distinguished former consul, took the unique step of becoming tribune. But a consul and a tribune of 122 together persuaded the citizen voters that it was against their interests to share the privileges of citizenship: the bill was defeated, and Gaius failed in his attempt to be re-elected once more. In 121, preparing (as private citizens) to use force to oppose the cancellation of some of their laws, Gaius and Flaccus were killed in a riot, and many of their followers were executed.
              </p>
              <p>During the next decade the measures benefiting the people were largely abolished, though the Gracchan land distributions, converted into private property, did temporarily strengthen the Roman citizen peasantry. The provisions giving power to wealthy nonsenators could not be touched, for political reasons, and they survived as the chief effect of Gaius’ tribunates. The court seems to have worked better than before, and, during the next generation, several other standing criminal courts were instituted, as were occasional ad hoc tribunals, always with the same class of jurors. In 106 a law adding senators to the juries was passed, but it remained in force for only a short time.</p>

It would be mere paradox to deny the importance in republican Rome, as in better known aristocratic republics, of family feuds, alliances, and policies, and parts of the picture are known—<e>e.g.</e>, the central importance of the family of the Metelli, prominent in politics for a generation after the Gracchi and dominant for part of that time.

Rome’s usual diplomatic methods failed to stop Jugurtha from disposing of his brothers, but the massacre of Italian settlers at Cirta by his soldiers forced the Senate to declare war (112). The war was waged reluctantly and ineffectively, with the result that charges of bribery were freely bandied about by demagogic tribunes taking advantage of suspicion of aristocratic political behaviour that had smoldered ever since the Gracchan crisis. Significantly, some eminent men, hated from those days, were now convicted of corruption. The Metelli, however, emerged unscathed, and Quintus Metellus, consul in 109, was entrusted with the war in Africa. He waged it with obvious competence but failed to finish it and thus gave <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365552" tocid="">Gaius Marius</xref>, a senior officer, his chance.

              <headtitle>The career of Gaius Marius</headtitle>
              <p>
                Marius, born of an equestrian family at Arpinum, had attracted the attention of Scipio Aemilianus as a young soldier and, by shrewd political opportunism, had risen to the praetorship and married into the patrician family of the Julii Caesares. Though Marius had deeply offended the Metelli, once his patrons, his considerable military talents had induced <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378097" tocid="">Quintus Metellus</xref> to take him to Africa as a <e>legatus</e>. Marius intrigued against his commander in order to gain a consulship; he was elected (chiefly with the help of the equites and antiaristocratic tribunes) for 107 and was given charge of the war by special vote of the people. He did little better than Metellus had, but in 105 his quaestor Lucius Sulla, in delicate and dangerous negotiations, brought about the capture of Jugurtha, opportunely winning the war for Marius and Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the preceding decade a serious threat to Italy had developed in the north. Starting in 125, several Roman commanders (Marcus Flaccus has been noted) had fought against Ligurian and Gallic tribes in southern France and had finally established a Roman sphere of influence there: a road had been built linking Italy with Spain, and some garrison posts probably secured it; finally, a colony was settled at Narbonne, an important road junction (<e>c.</e> 118). But, unwilling to extend administrative responsibilities, the Senate had refused to establish a regular <e>provincia</e>. Then some migrating German tribes, chief of them the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117886" tocid="">Cimbri</xref>, after defeating a Roman consul, invaded southern France, attracting native sympathy and finding little effective Roman opposition. Two more consular armies suffered defeat, and in October 105 a consul and proconsul with their forces were destroyed at Orange. There was panic in Rome, allayed only by the firm action of the other consul, Publius Rutilius Rufus.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this moment news of Marius’ success in Africa arrived, and he was at once dispensed from legal restrictions and again elected consul for 104. After a brilliant triumph that restored Roman morale, he took over the army prepared and trained by Rutilius. He was reelected consul year after year, while the German tribes delayed attacking Italy. Finally, in 102–101, he annihilated them at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-les-Bains) and, with his colleague, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="100216" tocid="">Quintus Catulus</xref>, on the Campi Raudii (near the Po delta). Another triumph and a sixth consulship (in 101) were his reward.
              </p>
              <p>In his first consulship, Marius had taken a step of great (and probably unrecognized) importance: aware of the difficulties long endemic in the traditional system of recruitment, he had ignored property qualifications in enrolling his army and, as a result, had recruited ample volunteers among men who had nothing to lose. This radical solution was thenceforth generally imitated, and conscription became confined to emergencies (such as the Social and Civil wars). He also enhanced the importance of the legionary eagle (the standard), thus beginning the process that led to each legion’s having a continuing corporate identity. At the same time, Rutilius introduced arms drill and reformed the selection of senior officers. Various tactical reforms in due course led to the increasing prominence of the cohort (one-tenth of a legion) as a tactical unit and the total reliance on non-Roman auxiliaries for light-armed and cavalry service. The precise development of these reforms cannot be traced, but they culminated in the much more effective armies of Pompey and Caesar.</p>
              <p>
                Marius’ African army had been unwilling to engage in another war, and Marius preferred to use newly levied soldiers (no longer difficult to find). But neither he nor the Senate seemed aware of any responsibilities to the veterans. In 103 a tribune, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="525237" tocid="">Lucius Saturninus</xref>, offered to pass a law providing land in Africa for them in return for Marius’ support for some anti-oligarchic activities of his own. Marius agreed, and the large lots distributed to his veterans (both Roman and Italian) turned out to be the beginning of the Romanization of Africa. In 100, with the German wars ended, Saturninus again proved a welcome ally, arranging for the settlement of Marius’ veterans in Gaul. An incidental effect was the departure of Marius’ old commander and subsequent enemy, Quintus Metellus, who refused to recognize the validity of Saturninus’ law and, choosing martyrdom, went into exile. But this time Saturninus exacted a high price. With his ally, the praetor Gaius Glaucia, he introduced laws to gain the favour of plebs and equites and proceeded to provide for the settlement of veterans of wars in Macedonia and Sicily in the same way as for those of Marius’ war. He planned to seek reelection for 99, with Glaucia illegally gaining the consulship. Violence and even murder were freely used to accomplish these aims.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marius now had to make a choice. Saturninus and Glaucia might secure him the continuing favour of the plebs and perhaps the equites, though they might also steal it for themselves. But as the saviour of his country and six times consul, he now hoped to become an elder statesman (<e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="476726" tocid="">princeps</xref>
                </e>), accepted and honoured by those who had once looked down on him as an upstart. To this end he had long laboured, dealing out favours to aristocrats who might make useful allies. This was the reward Marius desired for his achievement; he never thought of revolution or tyranny. Hence, when called on to save the state from his revolutionary allies, he could not refuse. He imprisoned them and their armed adherents and did not prevent their being lynched. Yet, having saved the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427558" tocid="">oligarchy</xref> from revolution, he received little reward; he lost the favour of the plebs, while the oligarchs, in view of both his birth and his earlier unscrupulous ambition, refused to accept him as their equal. Metellus was recalled; this was a bitter blow to Marius’ prestige, and he preferred to leave Rome and visit Asia.
              </p>
              <p>Before long a face-saving compromise was found, and Marius returned; but in the 90s he played no major part. Though he held his own when his friends and clients were attacked in the courts, his old aristocratic protégés now found more promising allies. Sulla is typical: closely associated with Marius in his early career, he was by 91 ready to take the lead in attacking Marius and (significantly) found eager support. The oligarchy could not forgive Marius.</p>

                In foreign affairs the 90s were dominated by Asia, Rome’s chief source of income. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="386057" tocid="">Mithradates VI</xref>, king of Pontus, had built a large empire around the Black Sea and was probing and intriguing in the Roman sphere of influence. Marius had met him and had given him a firm warning, temporarily effective: Mithradates had proper respect for Roman power. Scheming to annex Cappadocia, he had been thwarted by the Senate’s instructing Sulla, as proconsul, to install a pro-Roman king there in 96–95. (It was on this occasion that Sulla received a Parthian embassy—the first contact between the two powers.) But dissatisfaction in the Roman province of Asia gave new hope to Mithradates. Ineffectively organized after <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="26334" tocid="">annexation</xref> and corrupt in its cities’ internal administration, it was soon overrun with Italian businessmen and Roman tax collectors. When the Senate realized the danger, it sent its most distinguished jurist, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="526257" tocid="">Quintus Mucius Scaevola</xref> (consul in 95 and <e>pontifex maximus</e>), on an unprecedented mission to reorganize Asia (94). He took Publius Rutilius Rufus—jurist, stoic philosopher, and former consul—with him as his senior officer, and after Scaevola’s return Rutilius remained behind, firmly applying the new principles they had established. This caused an outcry from businessmen, whose profits Scaevola had kept within bounds; he was prosecuted for “extortion” in 92 and convicted after a trial in which Roman <e>publicani</e> and businessmen unscrupulously used their power among the class that provided criminal juries. The verdict revealed the breakdown of Gaius Gracchus’ system: the class he had raised to watch over the Senate now held irresponsible power, making orderly administration impossible and endangering the empire. Various leading senators were at once vexatiously prosecuted, and political chaos threatened.

              <headtitle>Developments in Italy</headtitle>
              <p>
                The 90s also saw dangerous developments in Italy. In the 2nd century <e ty="s">bc</e>, Italians as a whole had shown little desire for Roman citizenship and had been remarkably submissive under exploitation and ill-treatment. The most active of their governing class flourished in overseas business, and the more traditionally minded were content to have their oligarchic rule supported by Rome. Their admission to citizenship had been proposed as a by-product of the Gracchan reforms. By 122 it had become clear that the Roman people agreed with the oligarchy in rejecting it. The sacrifices demanded of Italy in the Numidian and German wars probably increased dissatisfaction among Italians with their patently inferior status. Marius gave citizenship to some as a reward for military distinction—illegally, but his standing (<e>auctoritas</e>) sufficed to defend his actions. Saturninus admitted Italians to veteran settlements and tried to gain citizenship for some by full admission to Roman colonies. The censors of 97–96, aristocrats connected with Marius, shared his ideas and freely placed eminent Italians on the citizen registers. This might have allayed dissatisfaction, but the consuls of 95 passed a law purging the rolls and providing penalties for those guilty of fraudulent arrogation. The result was insecurity and danger for many leading Italians. By 92 there was talk of violence and conspiracy among desperate men.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was in these circumstances that the eminent young noble, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="172177" tocid="">Marcus Livius Drusus</xref>, became tribune for 91 and hoped to solve the menacing accumulation of problems by means of a major scheme of reforms. He attracted the support of the poor by agrarian and colonial legislation and tried to have all Italians admitted to citizenship and to solve the jury problem by a compromise: the courts would be transferred to the Senate, and 300 equites would be admitted to it. (To cope with the increase in business it would need this expansion in size.) Some leading senators, frightened at the dangerous situation that had developed, gave weighty support. Had Drusus succeeded, the poor and the Italians might have been satisfied; the equites, deprived of their most ambitious element by promotion, might have acquiesced; and the Senate, always governed by the prestige of the noble <e>principes</e> rather than by votes and divisions, could have returned, little changed by the infusion of new blood, to its leading position in the process of government. But Drusus failed. Some members of each class affected were more conscious of the loss than of the gain; and an active consul, Lucius Philippus, provided leadership for their disparate opposition. After much violence, Drusus’ laws were declared invalid. Finally he himself was assassinated. The Italians now rose in revolt (the Social War), and in Rome a special tribunal, manned by the Gracchan jury class, convicted many of Drusus’ supporters until the Senate succeeded in suspending its sittings because of the military danger.

                The first year of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551524" tocid="">Social War</xref> (90) was dangerous: the tribes of central and southern Italy, traditionally among the best soldiers in Rome’s wars, organized in a confederacy for the struggle that had been forced upon them.

Moreover, Rome now showed its old ability to act quickly and wisely in emergencies: the consul Lucius Caesar passed a law giving citizenship to all Italians who wanted it. The measure came in time to head off major revolts in Umbria and Etruria, which accepted at once.

                In 89 the war in central Italy was won, and Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo celebrated a triumph.

A Roman embassy restored them, and he withdrew. However, when the envoys incited Bithynian incursions into his territory, Mithradates launched a major offensive; he overran the two kingdoms and invaded Roman territory, where he attracted the sympathy of the natives by executing thousands of Italians and defeating and capturing the Roman commanders in the area.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Rome, various men, including Marius, had hoped for the Eastern command. But it went to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="572893" tocid="">Sulla</xref>, elected consul for 88 after distinguished service in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551524" tocid="">Social War</xref>. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573008" tocid="">Publius Sulpicius</xref>, a tribune in that year and an old friend of Drusus, tried to continue the latter’s policy of justice to the Italians by abolishing the gerrymandering that in practice deprived the new citizens of an effective vote. Finding the oligarchy firmly opposed, he gained the support of Marius (who still commanded much loyalty) for his plans by having the Eastern command transferred to him. After much street-fighting, the consuls escaped from Rome, and Sulpicius’ bills were passed. Sulla’s response was totally unforeseen: he appealed to the army he had led in the Social War, which was still engaged in mopping-up operations in Campania, and persuaded them to march on Rome. He occupied the city and executed Sulpicius; Marius and others escaped. Significantly, Sulla’s officers left him. It was the first time a private army of citizens had occupied Rome—an effect of Marius’ army reform, which had ended by creating a “client army” loyal chiefly to its commander, and of the Social War, which had made the use of force within Italy seem commonplace. The end of the republic was foreshadowed.

              <p>
                Having cowed Rome into acquiescence and having passed some legislation, Sulla left for the East. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118090" tocid="">Cinna</xref>, one of the consuls of 87, at once called for the overthrow of Sulla’s measures. Resisted by his colleague Octavius, he left Rome to collect an army and, with the help of Marius, occupied the city after a siege. Several leading men were killed or condemned to death, Sulla and his supporters were outlawed, and (after Marius’ death early in 86) another commander was sent to Asia. The policy now changed to one of reconciliation: the Social War was wound up, and the government gained wide acceptance until Cinna was killed by mutinous soldiers (84).

              <p>Sulla meanwhile easily defeated Mithradates’ forces in two battles in Boeotia, took Athens, which under a revolutionary regime had declared for Mithradates, and cleared the king’s army out of Greece. While negotiating with Cinna’s government, Sulla also entered upon negotiations with Mithradates and, when he heard of Cinna’s death, quickly made peace and an alliance with Mithradates, driving the government’s commander in Asia to suicide. After wintering his troops in the rich cities of Asia, Sulla crossed into Greece and then into Italy, where his veteran army broke all resistance and occupied Rome (82). Sulla was elected dictator and, while Italy and all the provinces except Spain were quickly reduced, began a reign of terror (the “proscriptions”), in which hundreds of his enemies or those of his adherents were killed without trial, while their property went to enrich him and his friends. Wherever in Italy he had met resistance, land was expropriated and given to his soldiers for settlement.</p>
              <p>While the terror prevailed, Sulla used his powers to put through a comprehensive program of reform (81). Although he had twice taken Rome with a private proletarian army, he had earlier had connections with the inner circles of the oligarchy, and after Cinna’s death some eminent men who had refused to collaborate with Cinna joined Sulla. By the time Sulla’s success seemed certain, even most of those who had collaborated were on his side, and he was acclaimed as the defender of the nobility who had defeated an illegal revolutionary regime. His reforms aimed chiefly at stabilizing Senate authority by removing alternative centres of power. The tribunate was emasculated; the censors’ powers were reduced; provincial governors were subjected to stricter Senate control; and the equites, who had been purged of Sulla’s opponents by the proscriptions, were deprived of some symbols of dignity and made leaderless by the inclusion of 300 of Sulla’s chief supporters in the Senate. The jury reform of Gaius Gracchus, seen by some leading senators as the prime cause of political disintegration, could now be undone, and the criminal courts could once more become a monopoly of senators.</p>
              <p>
                Sulla’s measures were by no means merely reactionary. His program was basically that of Marcus Drusus. His overriding aim was the restoration of stable government, and this could only come from the Senate, directed by the <e>principes</e> (former consuls and those they chose to consult). Sulla accepted and even extended recent developments where they seemed useful: the Italians retained full citizenship; the system of standing criminal courts was expanded; the practice of praetors normally spending their year of office in Rome and then going to provinces for a second year was extended to consuls and became an integral part of his system. To prevent long command of armies (which might lead to careers like his own), Sulla increased the number of praetors so that, in principle and in normal circumstances, each province might have a new governor every year. As for the overriding problem of poverty, his contribution to solving it was to settle tens of thousands of his veterans on land confiscated from enemies in Italy; having become landowners, the veterans would be ready to defend the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social order</xref>, in which they now had a stake, against the dispossessed.

              <p>
                At the beginning of 80 Sulla laid down his dictatorship and became merely consul, with the senior Metellus (Quintus Metellus Pius), a relative of his wife, as his colleague. The state of emergency was officially ended. At the end of the year, after seeing to the election of two reliable consuls, Sulla retired to Campania as a private citizen; he hoped that the restored oligarchy would learn to govern the state he had handed over to them. For 78 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336832" tocid="">Marcus Lepidus</xref>, an ambitious patrician whom Sulla disliked and distrusted, was elected consul. Sulla did not intervene.

              <p>Pompey was the son of Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, who had triumphed after the Social War but had incurred general hatred because of cold-blooded duplicity during the troubles of 88 and 87. After Strabo’s death, young Pompey, who had served under him and inherited his dubiously won wealth, was protected by Cinna’s government against his father’s enemies. Following in his father’s footsteps, he deserted the government after Cinna’s death, raised a force among his father’s veterans in central Italy, and helped to conquer Italy and, in a lightning campaign, Sicily and the province of Africa for Sulla. Though not old enough to hold any regular magistracy (he was born in 106), he had, from these military bases, blackmailed Sulla into granting him a triumph (81) and had married into the core of the Sullan oligarchy. Out of pique against Sulla, he had supported Lepidus’ election for 78, but he had too great a stake in the Sullan system to permit Lepidus to overthrow it.</p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile a more serious challenge to the system had arisen in Iberia. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="535908" tocid="">Quintus Sertorius</xref>, a former praetor of tough Sabine gentry stock, had refused to follow most of his social betters in joining Sulla; instead he had left for Spain, where he claimed to represent the legitimate government. Although acting throughout as a Roman proconsul, with a “counter-Senate” of eminent Roman citizens, Sertorius won the enthusiastic support of the native population by his fairness, honesty, and charisma, and he soon held most of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="280587" tocid="">Iberian Peninsula</xref>, defending it successfully even against a large force under Quintus <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378100" tocid="">Metellus Pius</xref>. When the consuls of 77 would have nothing to do with this war, Pompey was entrusted by the Senate, through the efforts of his eminent friends and sponsors, with the task of assisting Metellus. The war dragged on for years, with little glory for the Roman commanders. Although Sertorius had many sympathizers in Italy, superior numbers and resources finally wore him down, and he was assassinated by a Roman officer. Pompey easily defeated the remnants of Sertorius’ forces in 72.

              <p>
                The death of Nicomedes IV of Bithynia (74) led to another major war. Like Attalus of Pergamum, Nicomedes left his kingdom to Rome, and this provoked Mithradates, who was in contact with Sertorius and knew of Rome’s difficulties, to challenge Rome again. The Eastern command again led to intrigues in Rome. The command finally went to Lucius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350697" tocid="">Lucullus</xref>, a relative of Sulla and consul in 74, who hoped to build up a countervailing power in the East.

              <p>
                At the same time, Marcus Antonius, father of the later Triumvir, was given a command against the pirates in the eastern Mediterranean (whom his father had already fought in 102–100), partly, perhaps, as further reinsurance against Pompey. With Italian manpower heavily committed, a minor slave rising led by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="558359" tocid="">Spartacus</xref> (73) assumed threatening dimensions, until Marcus Crassus (an old Sullan and profiteer in the proscriptions) volunteered to accept a special command and defeated the slaves. At this point (71) Pompey returned from Spain with his army, crucified the remnants of the slave army, and claimed credit for the victory.

              <p>He and Crassus now confronted each other, each demanding the consulship for 70, though Pompey had held no regular magistracy and was not a senator. Agreeing to join forces, both secured it.</p>
              <p>
                During their consulship, the political, though not the administrative, part of the Sullan settlement was repealed. The tribunes’ powers were fully restored; criminal juries were divided between senators and wealthy nonsenators; and, for the first time since Sulla, two censors—both supporters of Pompey—were elected, who purged the Senate and, in compiling the registers, at last fully implemented the Italians’ citizenship. The year 70 also saw the prosecution of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626413" tocid="">Verres</xref> (son of a “new man” and Sullan profiteer), who had surpassed the liberal Roman conventions in exploiting his province of Sicily. For future impunity he relied on his aristocratic connections (especially the Metelli and their friends), his fortune, and the known corruptibility of the Sullan senatorial juries. But Verres was unlucky. First, he had ill-treated some of Pompey’s important Sicilian clients, thus incurring Pompey’s displeasure; next, his case coincided with the anti-Sullan reaction of 70; finally, the Sicilians succeeded in persuading <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117565" tocid="">Cicero</xref>—an ambitious young “new man” from Arpinum hoping to imitate the success of his fellow citizen Marius by means of his rhetorical ability—to undertake the prosecution. Despite obstruction from Verres’ friends, Cicero collected massive evidence against him, presented his case to fit into the political context of the year, and obtained Verres’ conviction as an act of expiation for the shortcomings of the Sullan order.
              </p>
              <p>
                The year 70 thus marked the loss of control by the Sullan establishment. The nobility (families descended from consuls) continued to gain most of the consulships, with the old patriciate (revived by Sulla after a long decline) stronger than for generations; the Senate still supervised administration and made ordinary political decisions; the system continued to rely essentially on <e>mos majorum</e> (constitutional custom) and <e>auctoritas</e> (prestige)—potent forces in the status society of the Roman Republic. The solid bases of law and power that Sulla had tried to give it had been surrendered, however. The demagogue—tribune or consul—could use the legal machinery of the popular assembly (hence such men are called <e>populares</e>), while the commander could rely on his army in the pursuit of private ambition. The situation that Sulla had tried to remedy now recurred, made worse by his intervention. His massacres and proscriptions had weeded out the defenders of lawful government, and his rewards had gone to the timeservers and the unscrupulous. The large infusion of equites into the Senate had intensified the effect. While eliminating the serious friction between the two classes, which had made the state ungovernable by 91, it had filled the Senate with men whose tradition was the opposite of that sense of mission and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119404" tocid="">public service</xref> that had animated the best of the aristocracy. Few men in the new ruling class saw beyond self-interest and self-indulgence.
              </p>
              <p>
                One result was that massive bribery and civil disorder in the service of ambition became endemic. Laws were repeatedly passed to stop them, but they remained ineffective because few found it in their interest to enforce them. Exploitation of the provinces did not decrease after Verres: governors (still with unlimited powers) feathered their own nests and were expected to provide for all their friends. Extortion cases became a political ritual, with convictions impossible to obtain. Cicero, thenceforth usually counsel for the defense, presented hair-raising behaviour as commonplace and claimed it as acceptable. The Senate’s traditional opposition to annexation faded out. Pompey made Syria<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578856" tocid=""></xref> into a province and added a large part of Pontus to Bithynia (inherited in 74 and occupied in 70); the demagogue <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="122012" tocid="">Clodius</xref> annexed Cyprus—driving its king to suicide—to pay for his massive grain distributions in Rome; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88114" tocid="">Caesar</xref>, finally, conquered Gaul by open aggression and genocide and bled it white for the benefit of his friends and his ambitions. Crassus would have done the same with Parthia, had he succeeded. Opposition to all this in the Senate, where it appeared, was based on personal or political antagonism. If the robber barons were attacked on moral grounds, it was because of the use they made of their power in Rome.

              <p>
                Politically, the 60s lay under the shadow of Pompey. Refusing to take an ordinary province in 69, he waited for his chance. It came in 67 when his adherent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223116" tocid="">Gabinius</xref>, as tribune, secured him, against the opposition of all important men, an extraordinary command with unprecedented powers to deal with the pirates. Pompey succeeded within a few months where Antonius and others had failed. The equites and the people were delighted because trade, including Rome’s food imports, would now be secure. Meanwhile Lucullus had driven Mithradates out of Anatolia and into Armenia; but he had offended Roman businessmen by strict control and his own soldiers and officers by strict discipline. Faced with mutinies, he suffered a reverse and became vulnerable to attacks in Rome. In 66 another tribunician law appointed Pompey, fresh from his naval victories, to take over supreme command in the East, which he did at once, studiously insulting his predecessor. He quickly defeated Mithradates and procured his death, then spent some time in a total reorganization of the East, where Asia (the chief source of revenue) was protected by three further provinces and a ring of client states beyond the frontier. The whole of the East now stood in his <e>clientela</e> (clientship), and most of it owed him money as well. He returned by far the wealthiest man in Rome.

              <headtitle>Political suspicion and violence</headtitle>
              <p>
                Meanwhile Roman politics had been full of suspicion and violence, much of it stirred up by Crassus who, remembering 71, feared Pompey’s return and tried to make his own power impregnable. There was much material for revolution, with poverty (especially in the country, among families dispossessed by Sulla) and debt (among both the poor and the dissolute rich) providing suitable issues for unscrupulous <e>populares</e>. One such man, the patrician <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99879" tocid="">Catiline</xref>, after twice failing to gain the consulship by traditional bribery and intrigue, put himself at the head of a movement planning a coup d’état in Rome to coincide with an armed rising in Italy (late 63). Cicero, as consul, defeated these efforts and, relying on the doubtful legality of a Senate vote in support, had <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99879" tocid="">Catiline</xref>’s eminent Roman associates executed. Catiline himself fell in a desperate battle.
              </p>
              <p>For Cicero—the “new man” who had made his way to the top by his own oratorical and political skill, obliging everyone by unstinting service, representing Pompey’s interests in Rome while avoiding offense to Pompey’s enemies—this was the climax of his life. Like his compatriot Marius, he had saved the state for its rulers: he had taken resolute action when those rulers were weak and vacillating; and, like Marius, he got small thanks for it. Pompey was miffed at having to share his fame with a municipal upstart, and eminent gentlemen could not forgive that upstart for having driven patricians to their death.</p>
              <p>Pompey’s return was peaceful. Like Marius, he wanted recognition, not tyranny. He dismissed his army, to the surprise of Crassus and others, and basked in the glory of his triumph and the honours voted to him. But having given up power, he found himself caught in a net of constitutional obstruction woven by his politically experienced enemies and was unable to have either of his principal demands met: land for his veterans and the ratification of his arrangements in the East. It was at this point that Caesar returned from Spain.</p>
              <p>
                Gaius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88114" tocid="">Julius Caesar</xref>, descended (as he insisted) from kings and gods, had shown talent and ambition in his youth: he opposed Sulla but without inviting punishment, married into the oligarchy but advocated popular causes, vocally defended Pompey’s interests while aiding Crassus in his intrigues and borrowing a fortune from him, flirted with Catiline but refused to dabble in revolution, then worked to save those whom Cicero executed. In 63 he won a startling success: defeating two distinguished <e>principes</e>, he, who had not yet been praetor, was elected <e>pontifex maximus</e>—a post of supreme dignity, power, and patronage. Despite some cynicism among Roman aristocrats toward the state religion, its ceremonial was kept up and was a recognized means of political manipulation; thus priesthoods could give more lasting power than magistracies, in addition to the cachet of social success. Young Caesar was now head of the hierarchy. After his praetorship (62), Caesar successfully governed Spain, clearing a surplus sufficient to pay off his debts. On returning to Rome, he naturally hoped for the consulship of 59; but his enemies, by legal chicanery, forced him to choose between standing for office and celebrating a triumph. He gave up the triumph and easily became consul.

                For his consulship Caesar fashioned an improbable alliance: his skill in having won the trust of both Crassus and Pompey enabled him to unite these two enemies in his support. Crassus had the connections, Pompey had the soldiers’ vote, and Caesar was consul and <e>pontifex maximus</e>. The combination (often misleadingly called the “first <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606116" tocid="">Triumvirate</xref>”) was invincible, especially since the consul Caesar had no scruples about countering legal obstruction with open force. Pompey got what he wanted, and so did Crassus (whose immediate need was a concession to the Asian tax farmers, in whose companies he probably had much of his capital). In return, Caesar got a special command in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118628" tocid="">Cisalpine Gaul</xref> and Illyricum for five years by vote of the people; the Senate itself, on Pompey’s motion, extended it to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="602354" tocid="">Transalpine Gaul</xref>. Marriage alliances sealed the compact, chief of them Pompey’s marriage to Caesar’s daughter Julia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Caesar left for Gaul, but Rome was never the same; the shadow of the alliance hung over it, making the old-style politics impossible. In 58 Publius Clodius, another aristocratic demagogue, was tribune and defended Caesar’s interests. Cicero had incurred Clodius’ enmity and was now sacrificed to him: he was driven into exile as having unlawfully executed citizens in 63. By 57 Caesar’s allies had drifted back into rivalry. Pompey secured Cicero’s return, and Cicero at once tried to break up the alliance by attracting Pompey to the Senate’s side. Just when he seemed about to succeed, the three dynasts secretly met and revived their compact (56). Rome had to bow once more. In 55 Pompey and Crassus were consuls, and the contents of their secret agreement were slowly revealed. Caesar, whom his enemies had made efforts to recall, was prolonged in his command for five years and (it later appeared) had been promised another consulship straight after, to secure him against prosecution and give him a chance of another army command. Pompey was given a special command over all of Spain, which he exercised through deputies while he himself remained just outside Rome to keep an eye on the city. Crassus, who now needed glory and new wealth to equal those of his allies, was to attack <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="444876" tocid="">Parthia</xref> with a large army. Thus the three dynasts would practically monopolize military power for the foreseeable future.
              </p>
              <p>Cicero, among others, had to submit and was thenceforth their loyal spokesman. After his achievement of 63 he had dreamed of leading a coalition of all “right-thinking” men in Italy in defending the traditional oligarchy, but he had found little support among the oligarchy. He now used this fact to rationalize his surrender. His brother took service in Gaul under Caesar.</p>
              <p>The dynasts’ pact did not even bring peace. Clodius, as tribune, had created a private army, and there was no state force to counter it. Pompey could have done it by calling his soldiers in, but the Senate did not trust him enough to request this, and Pompey did not wish to parade himself as an unashamed tyrant. Other men formed private armies in opposition to Clodius, and one Milo at last managed to have him killed after a scuffle (52). By then, however, Roman politics had radically and unexpectedly changed.</p>

              <p>
                Julia died in 54, breaking the ties between Caesar and Pompey. Caesar pressed Pompey to renew them, but Pompey held off, preserving his freedom of action. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="141893" tocid="">Crassus’</xref> Parthian campaign ended in disaster and in Crassus’ death (53). By 52 Pompey and Caesar stood face to face, still nominally friends but with no personal link between them and no common interests. Caesar, by conquering the whole of Gaul, had almost equaled Pompey’s prestige and, by his utterly ruthless way of waging war, Pompey’s wealth. Unlike Pompey, he used his wealth to dispense patronage and buy useful friends. At this point Pompey cautiously offered the oligarchy his support. It had much to give him that he wanted—control of the administrative machine, respectability, and the seal of public approval. Its leaders (even the intransigent young Cato, who had led opposition to the three individually long before their alliance and to their joint oppression of the state ever since) now recognized that acceptance of Pompey’s terms and surrender to his protection was their only chance of survival. Pompey at once turned firmly against Milo, who presented a political threat: if Milo could use the force that had killed Clodius to keep firm control of Rome, he—an ambitious man of known conservative views—might in due course offer an alternative and more trustworthy champion to the oligarchy. But he was not yet ready. Pompey forced them to make their choice at once, and they chose Pompey in preference. He was made sole consul and had Milo convicted by an intimidated court. Meanwhile he had made a marriage alliance with the noblest man in Rome, Quintus Metellus Scipio, who became his colleague in the consulship. The state had captured Pompey (or vice versa), and Caesar stood alone in opposition to both of them. During the next two years there were a series of maneuvers: the Senate leaders, with Pompey’s silent support, worked for Caesar’s recall, which would have meant his instantly sharing the fate of Milo; while Caesar and his agents in Rome tried to strike some bargain that would ensure his safety and his future in politics. Finally, Pompey declared himself, and, early in 49, the Senate voted to outlaw Caesar. Two tribunes supporting him (one of them Mark Antony) had to flee. By the time they reached him, Caesar had already crossed the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="511950" tocid="">Rubicon:</xref> he now had a cause.

                Pompey had exuded confidence over the outcome if it came to war. In fact, however, Caesar’s veterans were unbeatable, and both men knew it. To the disgust of his followers, Pompey evacuated Rome, then Italy. His plan was to bottle Caesar up in Italy and starve him out. But Caesar, in a lightning sweep, seized Massilia and Spain from Pompey’s commanders, then crossed into Greece, where a short campaign ended in Pompey’s decisive defeat at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="455221" tocid="">Pharsalus</xref> (48). Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was assassinated by a man hoping thus to curry Caesar’s favour. This was by no means the end of the war.

              <headtitle>The dictatorship and assassination of Caesar</headtitle>
              <p>
                In Rome the administrative machine had inevitably been disrupted, and Caesar had always remained in control, as consul or as dictator. Those who had feared proscriptions, or hoped for them, were proved wrong. Some of Caesar’s enemies had their property confiscated, but it was sold at fair value; most were pardoned and suffered no loss. One of these was Cicero, who, after much soul-searching, had followed his conscience by joining <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469463" tocid="">Pompey</xref> before Pharsalus. Poverty and indebtedness were alleviated, but there was no wholesale cancellation of debts or redistribution of property, and many of Caesar’s adherents were disappointed. Nor was there a general reform of the republic. (Caesar’s only major reform was of the calendar: indeed, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307826" tocid="">Julian calendar</xref> proved adequate for centuries.) The number of senators and magistrates was increased, the citizenship was more freely given, and the province of Asia was relieved of some of its tax burden. But Caesar had no plan for reforming the system—not even to the extent that Sulla had tried to do, for Sulla had at least planned for his own retirement. For a time, honourable men, such as Cicero, hoped that the “Dictator for Settling the Constitution” (as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88114" tocid="">Caesar</xref> called himself) would produce a real constitution—some return to free institutions. By late 45 that hope was dead. Caesar was everywhere, doing everything to an almost superhuman degree. He had no solution for the crisis of the republic except to embody it in himself and none at all for the hatred of his peers, which he knew this was causing. He began to accept more and more of the honours that a subservient Senate invidiously offered, until finally he reached a position perilously close to kingship (an accursed term in Rome) and even deification. Whether he passed those hazy boundary lines is much debated and not very important. He had put himself in a position in which no Roman ought to have been and which no Roman aristocrat could tolerate. As a loyal friend of his was later to say: “With all his genius, he saw no way out.” To escape the problem or postpone it, he prepared for a Parthian war to avenge Crassus—a project most likely to have ended in similar disaster. Before he could start on it, about 60 men—former friends and old enemies, honourable patriots and men with grievances—struck him down in the Senate on March 15, 44 <e ty="s">bc</e>.

But a challenger for the position of leader of the Caesarians soon appeared in the person of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43047" tocid="">Octavian</xref>, Caesar’s son by adoption and now his heir. Though not yet 20, Octavian proved an accomplished politician; he attracted loyalty as a Caesarian while cooperating against Antony with the Senate, which, under Cicero’s vigorous leadership, now turned against the consul. Cicero hoped to fragment and thus defeat the Caesarian party, with the help of Brutus and Cassius, who were making good progress in seizing control of the eastern provinces and armies. In 43 the two consuls (both old Caesarian officers) and Octavian defeated Antony at Mutina, and success seemed imminent. But the consuls died, and Octavian demanded and, by armed force, obtained the consulship; and the armies of Italy, Spain, and Gaul soon showed that they would not fight against one another. Octavian, Antony, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336835" tocid="">Lepidus</xref> (the senior Caesarian with an army) now had themselves appointed “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606116" tocid="">Triumvirs</xref> for Settling the Constitution” for five years and secured control of Italy by massive proscriptions and confiscations (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117565" tocid="">Cicero</xref>, Antony’s chief enemy, was among the first to die). They then defeated and killed Brutus and Cassius at Philippi (42) and divided the Roman world among themselves, with Lepidus, a weak man accidentally thrust into prominence, getting the smallest share. Octavian, who was to control Italy, met armed opposition from Antony’s brother and wife, but they got no help from Antony and were defeated at Perusia (41). <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="424838" tocid="">Octavian</xref> and Antony sealed their alliance with a marriage compact: Antony married Octavia, Octavian’s sister. Octavian then confronted Pompey’s son Sextus <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469447" tocid="">Pompeius</xref>, who had seized control of the islands off Italy. After much diplomatic maneuvering (including another meeting with Antony), Octavian attacked and defeated Sextus; when Lepidus tried to reassert himself, Octavian crushed him and stripped him of his office of Triumvir (while with conspicuous piety leaving him the chief pontificate, now an office without power). Octavian now controlled the West and Antony the East, still officially as Triumvirs (their term of office had been extended), even though Lepidus had been eliminated in 36.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of the two leaders embarked on campaigns and reorganization in his half—Octavian in Illyricum, Antony particularly on the Parthian frontier. But Antony now married <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121230" tocid="">Cleopatra</xref> and tried to make <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="180468" tocid="">Egypt</xref> his military and political base. In a war of propaganda, Octavian gradually convinced the western provinces, Italy, and most of the Roman upper class that Antony was sacrificing Roman interests, trying to become a Hellenistic king in Alexandria, and planning to rule the Roman world from there with Cleopatra. In 32, though he now held no legal position, Octavian intimidated most of Antony’s remaining aristocratic friends into joining him, made the whole West swear allegiance to himself, and in 31, as consul, crossed into Greece to attack Antony. On September 2 he defeated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28869" tocid="">Antony and Cleopatra</xref> in a naval battle at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="4510" tocid="">Actium</xref>.

          <headtitle>Intellectual life of the Late Republic</headtitle>
          <p>The late Roman Republic, despite its turmoil, was a period of remarkable intellectual ferment. Many of the leading political figures were men of serious intellectual interests and literary achievement; foremost among them were Cicero, Caesar, Cato, Pompey, and Varro, all of them senators. The political upheaval itself leavened intellectual life; imperial senators were to look back to the late republic as a time when great political struggles stimulated great oratory, something the more ordered world of the emperors could no longer do.</p>
          <p>
            The seeds of intellectual development had been sown in the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries; the flowering came in the last generation of the republic. As late as the 90s <e ty="s">bc</e> the Romans still appear relatively unsophisticated. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244231" tocid="">Greek</xref> intellectuals were absorbed in debates among themselves, giving only passing nods to Romans by dedicating untechnical works to them. In 92 the censors issued an edict closing down the schools of Latin rhetoric in Rome. Serious students such as Cicero had to go east in the 80s to receive their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="265464" tocid="">higher education</xref> from leading Greek philosophers and rhetoricians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The centre of intellectual life began to shift toward the West after the 90s. As a result of the Mithradatic wars, libraries were brought from the East to Italy. The Hellenistic kingdoms, which had provided the patronage for much intellectual activity, were dismantled by Pompey and Octavian, and Greek intellectuals increasingly joined the retinues of great Roman senators such as Pompey. Private Roman houses, especially senatorial villas on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="402901" tocid="">Bay of Naples</xref>, became the focus of intellectual life; it was there that libraries were reassembled and Greek teachers kept as dependents.
          </p>
          <p>Roman traditions favoured the development of certain disciplines, creating a pattern that was distinct from the Greek. Disciplines related to the public life of senators prospered—notably oratory, law, and history; certain fields of study were judged fit for diversions in leisure hours, and still others were considered beneath the dignity of an honourable Roman. Areas such as medicine and architecture were left to Greeks and others of lower status, and mathematics and the sciences aroused little interest. Greek slaves especially played an important role in the intellectual life of the late republic, serving in roles as diverse as teachers, copyists of manuscripts, and oral readers to aristocrats.</p>
          <p>
            By the beginning of the imperial era the maturing of Roman intellectual culture was evident. Caesar had commissioned Varro to organize the first public library in Rome, and Greek scholars such as the geographer <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="567832" tocid="">Strabo</xref> moved west to pursue their studies in Rome.
          </p>
          <h2 tocid="26647">
            <headtitle>Grammar and rhetoric</headtitle>
            <p>
              The education of the Roman elite was dominated by training in language skills, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="240915" tocid="">grammar</xref>, and rhetoric. The <e>grammatici</e>, who taught grammar and literature, were lower-class and often servile dependents. Nevertheless, they helped to develop a Roman consciousness about “proper” spelling and usage that the elite adopted as a means of setting themselves off from humbler men. This interest in language was expressed in Varro’s work on words and grammar, <e>De Lingua Latina</e> (43?), with its prescriptive tone. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501179" tocid="">Rhetoric</xref>, though a discipline of higher status, was still taught mainly by Greeks in Greek. The rhetoricians offered rules for composition: how to elaborate a speech with ornamentation and, more important, how to organize a work through the dialectical skills of definition and division of the subject matter into analytical categories. The Romans absorbed these instructions so thoroughly that the last generation of the republic produced an equal of the greatest Greek orators in Cicero. The influence on Roman culture of dialectical thinking, instilled through rhetoric, can hardly be overstated; the result was an increasingly disciplined, well-organized habit of thinking. This development can be seen most clearly in the series of agricultural works by Roman authors: whereas Cato’s 2nd-century <e>De agricultura</e> is rambling and disorganized, Varro’s three books on <e>Res rusticae</e> (37), with their division of soils into 99 types, seem excessively organized.

          <h2 tocid="26648">
            <headtitle>Law and history</headtitle>
            <p>
              <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref>, though traditional in content, was also deeply influenced by Greek dialectic. For centuries the law had been passed down orally by pontifical priests. It emerged as an intellectual discipline only in the late republic, when men who saw themselves as legal specialists began to write treatises aimed at organizing existing law into a system, defining principles and concepts, and then applying those principles systematically. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="526259" tocid="">Quintus Mucius Scaevola</xref> was a pivotal figure: a pontifex in the traditional role, he published the first systematic legal treatise, <e>De iure civili</e>, in the 80s. Cicero credited his contemporary <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573010" tocid="">Servius Sulpicius Rufus</xref> with being the jurist who transformed law into a discipline (<e>ars</e>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The decisive events of the late republic stimulated the writing of history. The first extant historical works in Latin (rather than in Greek) date from this period: Sallust’s <e>Bellum Iugurtinum</e> (<e>Iugurthine War</e>) and <e>Bellum Catilinae</e> (<e>Catilinarian Conspiracy</e>) and Caesar’s memoirs about his Gallic and civil wars. The rapid changes also prompted antiquarian studies as Roman senators looked back to archaic institutions and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="504688" tocid="">religious rituals</xref> of the distant past to legitimize or criticize the present. Varro’s 41 books (now lost) on <e>Antiquitates terum humanarum et divinarum</e> (“Antiquities of things human and divine”) were influential in establishing the traditions of early Rome for future generations.

            <headtitle>Philosophy and poetry</headtitle>
            <p>
              Philosophy and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331905" tocid="">poetry</xref> were suitable as pastimes for senators; few, however, were as serious about philosophy as the younger Cato and Cicero. Even Cicero’s philosophical works were not technical treatises by Greek standards; rather, they were presented as dialogues among leading senators in their leisure. Similarly, Lucretius’ <e>De rerum natura</e> (<e>On the Nature of Things</e>; 50s) offered, in verse, a nontechnical explanation of Epicureanism. The technical philosophical works were written by humbler men and are now lost. A survey of their names and titles, however, shows that stoicism was not yet the dominant philosophical school it later became; more in evidence were the Epicureans, peripatetics, and academics. There also were revivals of Aristotelian and Pythagorean studies in this period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best-known poets of the late republican and civil war periods came from well-to-do Italian families. Catullus from Verona (<e>c.</e> 84–<e>c.</e> 54) had a reputation as <e>doctus</e> (learned) for his exquisitely crafted poems full of literary allusions in the Alexandrian style. Far from cumbersome, however, were many of his short, witty poems that challenged traditional Roman mores and deflated senatorial pretensions. Rome’s greatest poets, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629832" tocid="">Virgil</xref> (70–19) and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="271624" tocid="">Horace</xref> (65–8), were born during the republic, came of age during the civil wars, and survived to celebrate the victory of their patron, Augustus. Virgil’s <e>Eclogues</e> one and nine, written during the civil wars, poignantly evoke the suffering of the upheaval that ironically inspired Rome’s highest intellectual and artistic achievements.

                Law and order had vanished from the Roman state when its ruling aristocrats refused to curb their individual ambitions, when the most corrupt and violent persons could gain protection for their crimes by promising their support to the ambitious, and when the ambitious and the violent together could thus transform a republic based on disciplined liberty into a turbulent cockpit of murderous rivalries. Good government depended on limits being set to unrestrained aspirations, and Octavian was in a position to impose them. But his military might, though sufficiently strong in 31 <e ty="s">bc</e> to guarantee orderly political processes, was itself incompatible with them; nor did he relish the role of military despot. The fate of Julius Caesar, an eagerness to acquire political respectability, and his own esteem for ancestral custom combined to dissuade Octavian from it. He wished to be, in his own words, “the author of the best civilian government possible.” His problem was to regularize his own position so as to make it generally acceptable, without simultaneously reopening the door to violent lawlessness. His pragmatic responses not only ensured stability and continuity but also respected republican forms and traditions so far as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Large-scale demobilization allayed people’s fears; regular consular elections raised their hopes. In 29–28 <e ty="s">bc</e> Octavian carried out, with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="9788" tocid="">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</xref>, his powerful deputy, the first census of the Roman people since 70; and this involved drawing up an electoral roll for the Centuriate Assembly. Elections followed, and Octavian was inevitably chosen consul. Then, on Jan. 13, 27 <e ty="s">bc</e>, he offered to lay down his powers. The Roman Senate rejected this proposal, charging him instead to administer (besides Egypt) Spain, Gaul, and Syria for the next 10 years, while it itself was to supervise the rest of the empire. Three days later, among other honours, it bestowed upon him the name by which he has ever since been known, Augustus.
              </p>
              <p>
                As most of the troops still under arms were in the regions entrusted to Augustus’ charge, the arrangements of 27 <e ty="s">bc</e> hardly affected his military strength. Moreover, so long as he was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134489" tocid="">consul</xref> (he was reelected every year until 23 <e ty="s">bc</e>), he was civilian head of government as well. In other words, he was still preeminent and all-powerful, even if he had, in his own words, placed the <e>res publica</e> at the disposal of the Senate and the Roman people. Augustus particularly wished to conciliate the senatorial class, without whose cooperation civilian government was impossible. But his monopolization of the consulship offended the Senate, making a different arrangement clearly necessary. Accordingly, in 23 Augustus made a change; he vacated the consulship and never held it again (except momentarily in 5 <e ty="s">bc</e> and again in 2 <e ty="s">bc</e>, for a limited, specific purpose). In its place he received the tribunician power (<e>tribunicia potestas</e>). He could not become an actual plebeian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="604799" tocid="">tribune</xref>, because Julius Caesar’s action of making him a patrician had disqualified him for the office. But he could acquire the rights and privileges pertaining to the office; and they were conferred upon him, apparently by the Senate, whose action was then ratified by the popular assembly. He had already been enjoying some of a tribune’s privileges since 36; but he now acquired them all and even some additional ones, such as the right to convene the Senate whenever he chose and to enjoy priority in bringing business before it. Through his tribunician power he could also summon the popular assembly and participate fully in its proceedings. Clearly, although no longer consul, he still retained the legal right to authority in civilian affairs.
              </p>
              <p>The arrangement of 23 entailed an additional advantage. The power of the plebeian tribune was traditionally associated with the protection of citizens, and Augustus’ acquisition of it was therefore unlikely to rouse resentment. Indeed, Augustus thenceforth shrewdly propagated the notion that, if his position in the state was exceptional (which it clearly was), it was precisely because of his tribunician power. Although he held it for only one year at a time, it was indefinitely renewable and was pronounced his for life. Thus, it was both annual and perpetual and was a suitable vehicle for numbering the years of his supremacy. His era (and this is true also of later emperors) was counted officially from the year when he acquired the tribunician power.</p>
              <p>
                The year 23 likewise clarified the legal basis for Augustus’ control of his <e>provincia</e> (the region under his jurisdiction) and its armed forces. The Senate invested him with an <e>imperium proconsulare</e> (governorship and high command), and, while this had a time limit, it was automatically renewed whenever it lapsed (usually every 10 years). This proconsular <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284011" tocid="">imperium</xref>
                </e>, furthermore, was pronounced valid inside Italy, even inside Rome and the <e>pomerium</e> (the boundary within which only Roman gods could be worshiped and civil magistrates rule), and it was superior (<e>majus</e>) to the <e>imperium</e> of any other proconsul. Thus, Augustus could intervene legally in any province, even in one entrusted to someone else.
              </p>
              <p>
                The network of favours owed him that Augustus had cultivated within the state, among people of the greatest authority over their own networks, made his position virtually unassailable, but he avoided provoking this high class of his supporters, senatorial and equestrian, by not drawing attention to the most novel and autocratic of the many grants of power he had received, the <e>imperium proconsulare majus</e>. Instead, he paraded the tribunician power as the expression of his supreme position in the state.
              </p>
              <p>
                After 23 no fundamental change in Augustus’ position occurred. He felt no need to hold offices that in republican times would have conferred exceptional power (e.g., dictatorship, lifetime censorship, or regular consulship), even though these were offered him. Honours, of course, came his way: in 19 <e ty="s">bc</e> he received some consular rights and prerogatives, presumably to ensure that his <e>imperium</e> was in no particular inferior to a consul’s; in 12, when Lepidus died, he became <e>pontifex maximus</e> (he had long since been elected into all of the priestly colleges); in 8 <e ty="s">bc</e> the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42820" tocid="">8th month</xref> of the year was named after him; in 2 <e ty="s">bc</e> he was designated <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1336552" tocid="">pater patriae</xref>
                </e> (“father of his country”), a distinction that he particularly esteemed because it suggested that he was to all Romans what a <e>paterfamilias</e> was to his own household. He also accepted special commissions from time to time: e.g., the supervision of the supply of grain and water, the maintenance of public buildings (including temples), the regulation of the Tiber, the superintendence of the police and fire-fighting services, and the upkeep of Italy’s roads. Such behaviour advertised his will and capacity to improve the lives of people dependent on him. Of that capacity, manifest on a grand scale, his tribunician power and proconsular <e>imperium</e> were only the formal expression. He was a charismatic leader of unrivaled prestige (<e>auctoritas</e>), whose merest suggestions were binding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like an ordinary Roman, he contented himself with three names. His, however, Imperator Caesar Augustus, were absolutely unique, with a magic all their own that caused all later emperors to appropriate them, at first selectively but after <e ty="s">ad</e> 69 in their entirety. Thereby they became titles, reserved for the emperor (or, in the case of the name Caesar, for his heir apparent); from them derive the titles emperor, kaiser, and tsar. Yet, as used by Augustus and his first four successors, the words Imperator Caesar Augustus were names, not titles—that is, respectively, praenomen, nomen (in effect), and cognomen. One title that Augustus did have was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="476726" tocid="">princeps</xref> (prince); this, however, was unofficial—a mere popular label, meaning Rome’s first citizen—and government documents such as inscriptions or coins do not apply it to Augustus. But because of it the system of government he devised is called the principate.

              <headtitle>The Roman Senate and the urban magistracies</headtitle>
              <p>
                Augustus regarded the Senate, whose leading member (<e>princeps senatus</e>) he had become in 28, as a body with important functions; it heard fewer overseas embassies than formerly, but otherwise its dignity and authority seemed unimpaired; its members filled the highest offices; its decrees, although not formally called laws, were just as binding; it soon became a high court, whose verdicts were unappealable; it supervised the older provinces and nominally the state finances as well, and it also in effect elected the urban magistrates; formally, even the emperor’s powers derived from the Senate. Nevertheless, it lacked real power. Its provinces contained few troops (and by <e ty="s">ad</e> 40 it had ceased to control even these few). Hence, it could hardly dispute Augustus’ wishes. In fact, real power rested with Augustus, who superintended state finances and above all controlled membership in the Senate; every senator’s career depended on his goodwill. But he valued the Senate as the repository of the true Roman spirit and traditions and as the body representing <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482436" tocid="">public opinion</xref>. He was considerate toward it, shrewdly anticipated its reactions, and generally avoided contention with it. He regularly kept it informed about his activities; and an imperial council (Consilium Principis), which he consulted on matters of policy, in the manner of a republican magistrate seeking the opinion of his advisory committee, consisted of the consuls, certain other magistrates, and 15 senators—not handpicked by him but chosen by lot every six months.
              </p>
              <p>
                To rid the Senate of unworthy members, he reduced its numbers by successive reviews to about 600 (from the triumviral 1,000 or more). Sons of senators and men of good repute and substance who had served in the army and the <e>vigintiviri</e> (“board of twenty,” minor magistracy) could become members by being elected, at age 25 or over, to the quaestorship. Their subsequent rank in the Senate depended on what other magistracies they managed to win; these were, in ascending order, the aedileship (or plebeian tribunate), the praetorship, and the consulship. No one disliked by Augustus could expect to reach any of them, while anyone whom he nominated or endorsed was sure of election. Despite the emperor’s control, there were usually enough candidates for keen contests. By <e ty="s">ad</e> 5 <e>destinatio</e> seems to have been the practice—that is, a special panel of senators and equites selected the praetors and consuls, and the <e>comitia centuriata</e> automatically ratified their choice. In about <e ty="s">ad</e> 5, likewise, the consulship was shortened to six months. This not only gratified senators and increased the number of high-ranking qualified officials but also showed that the consuls’ duties were becoming largely ceremonial. This was also true, but to a far lesser degree, of the other unpaid magistrates. A senator really made his mark in between his magistracies, when he served in important salaried posts, military or civilian or both, sometimes far from Rome.

              <headtitle>The equestrian order</headtitle>
              <p>
                Senators, however, were either too proud or too few to fill all the posts. Some posts were considered menial and went to the emperor’s freedmen or slaves. Others were entrusted to equites, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="190709" tocid="">equestrian</xref> order soon developed into one of the great institutions of the empire. Augustus decided that membership in the order should be open to Roman citizens of means and reputation but not necessarily of good birth. Ultimately, there were thousands of equites throughout the empire. Although this was a lower aristocracy, a good career was available to them. After tours of duty as an army officer (the so-called <e>militiae equestres</e>), an aspiring <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="190709" tocid="">eques</xref> might serve as the emperor’s agent (procurator) in various capacities and eventually become one of the powerful prefects (of the fleet, of the <e>vigiles</e>, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="207834" tocid="">fire brigade</xref>, of the grain supply, of Egypt, or of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473662" tocid="">Praetorian Guard</xref>). This kind of an equestrian career became standardized only under Claudius I; but Augustus began the system and, by his use of equites in responsible posts, founded the imperial civil service, which later was headed chiefly by them. The equites also performed another function: the senatorial order had difficulty in maintaining its numbers from its own ranks and depended on recruitment from below, which meant from the equestrian order. Because this order was not confined to Rome or even to Italy, the Senate gradually acquired a non-Italian element. The western provinces were already supplying senators under Augustus.

              <headtitle>Administration of Rome and Italy</headtitle>
              <p>
                Ordinary Roman citizens who were neither senators nor equites were of lesser consequence. Although still used, the old formula <e>senatus populusque Romanus</e> (“the Senate and the Roman people”) had changed its meaning: in effect, its <e>populusque Romanus</e> portion now meant “the emperor.” The “Roman people” had become the “Italian people,” and it was embodied in the person of Augustus, himself the native of an Italian town. To reduce the risk of popular demonstrations in Rome, the emperor provided grain doles, occasional donatives, and various entertainments; but he allowed the populace no real power. After <e ty="s">ad</e> 5 the Roman people’s participation in public life consisted in the formality of holding occasional assemblies to ratify decisions made elsewhere. Ultimately, this caused the distinction between the Roman citizens of Italy and the provincial inhabitants of the overseas empire to disappear; under Augustus, however, the primacy of Italy was insistently emphasized.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, Italy and justice for its inhabitants were Augustus’ first cares. Arbitrary triumviral legislation was pronounced invalid after 29 <e ty="s">bc</e>, and ordinary Roman citizens everywhere had access to Augustus’ own court of appeal (his appellate jurisdiction dated from 30 <e ty="s">bc</e> and in effect replaced the republican appeal to the people). His <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473662" tocid="">praetorian</xref> and urban cohorts provided physical security; his officials assured grain supplies; and he himself, with help from such aides as Agrippa, monumentalized Italian towns. The numerous Augustan structures in Italy and Rome (as he boasted, a city of brick before his time and of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="363966" tocid="">marble</xref> afterward) have mostly perished, but impressive ruins survive (e.g., <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31132" tocid="">aqueduct</xref>, forum, and mausoleum in Rome; bridge at Narni; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32510" tocid="">arch</xref> at Fano; gate at Perugia). Doubtless their construction alleviated unemployment, especially among the proletariat at Rome. But economic considerations did not influence Augustus’ policies much (customs tariffs, for instance, were for fiscal, not protective, purposes), nor did he build harbour works at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="434389" tocid="">Ostia</xref>, Rome’s port. Italian commerce and industry—notably fine pottery, the so-called terra sigillata, and wine—nevertheless flourished in the conditions he created. Public finances, mints, and coinage issues, chaotic before him, were placed on a sound basis, partly by the introduction of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="519097" tocid="">sales tax</xref> and of a new levy (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="288220" tocid="">inheritance taxes</xref>) on Roman citizens—who hitherto had been subject only to harbour dues and manumission (see below) charges—and partly by means of repeated subventions to the public treasury (<e>aerarium Saturni</e>) from Augustus’ own enormous private resources (<e>patrimonium Caesaris</e>). His many highways also contributed to Italy’s economic betterment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Augustus’ great achievement in Italy, however, was to restore morale and unify the country. The violence and self-aggrandizement of the 1st century <e ty="s">bc</e> had bred apathy and corruption. To reawaken a sense of responsibility, especially in official and administrative circles, Augustus reaffirmed traditional Italian virtues (by laws aimed against adultery, by strengthening family ties, and by stimulating the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="66760" tocid="">birth rate</xref>) and revived ancestral <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">religion</xref> (by repairing temples, building new shrines, and reactivating moribund cults and rituals). To infuse fresh blood and energy into disillusioned Roman society, he promoted the assimilation of Italy: the elite of its municipal towns entered the Roman Senate, and Italy became firmly one with Rome. To keep the citizen body pure, he made manumission of slaves difficult, and from those irregularly manumitted he withheld the citizenship.

              <p>
                Sharply distinguished from Italy were the provinces of the empire. From 27 <e ty="s">bc</e> on they were of two types. The Senate supervised the long-established ones, the so-called public provinces: their governors were chosen by lot, usually served for a year, commanded no troops, and were called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477800" tocid="">proconsuls</xref> (although only those superintending Asia and Africa were in fact former consuls, the others being former praetors). The emperor supervised all other provinces, and collectively they made up his <e>provincia</e>: he appointed their governors, and these served at his pleasure, none with the title of proconsul because in his own <e>provincia</e> proconsular <e>imperium</e> was wielded by him alone. These imperial provinces might be “unarmed,” but many of them were garrisoned, some quite heavily. Those containing more than one legion were entrusted to former consuls and those with a legion or less to former praetors; in both cases their governors were called <e>legati Augusti pro praetore</e> (“legates of Augustus with authority of a praetor”). There were also some imperial provinces governed not by senators but by equites (usually styled procurators but sometimes prefects); Judaea at the time of Christ’s crucifixion was such an equestrian province, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="460341" tocid="">Pontius Pilate</xref> being its governor. An entirely exceptional imperial province was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="180468" tocid="">Egypt</xref>, so jealously guarded that no senator could visit it without express permission; its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="474622" tocid="">prefect</xref> was unique in being an equestrian in command of legions.

                The provinces paid tribute, which helped to pay for the armed services, various benefactions to supporters, a growing palace staff, and the public-works programs. Periodical censuses, carefully listing provincial resources, provided the basis for the two direct taxes: <e>tributum soli</e>, exacted from occupiers of provincial soil, and <e>tributum capitis</e>, paid on other forms of property (it was not a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="467842" tocid="">poll tax</xref>, except in Egypt and in certain backward areas). In addition, the provinces paid indirect taxes, such as harbour dues. In imperial provinces the direct taxes (<e>tributa</e>) were paid to the emperor’s procurator, an equestrian official largely independent of the governor. In senatorial provinces, quaestors supervised the finances; but, increasingly, imperial procurators also appeared. The indirect taxes (<e>vectigalia</e>) were still collected by <e>

                To reward his troops after faithful service, Caesar had settled them on lands mostly in the provinces, in veteran towns; and Augustus, for the same reason and to reduce the dangerous military presence in the state generally, resorted to the same procedure on a vast scale. Thus, in the space of a single generation, more than 120 new centres were organized across the empire in an explosion of urbanizing energy never equaled or even approached in later times. In the settlements called <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="126390" tocid="">coloniae</xref>
                </e> all residents were to be Roman citizens, and the form of government and many other aspects of life specified in their charters bore a thoroughly Roman character. Some <e>coloniae</e>, in further approximation to Italian models, enjoyed exemption from tribute. In the <e>

                </e> only persons elected as magistrates were awarded Roman citizenship (after <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="251204" tocid="">Hadrian</xref>, in Africa, admission was sometimes extended to the whole of the local senate); but the whole of the local aristocracy in the course of time would be in this way gradually incorporated fully into the state. In <e>municipia</e>, too, charters specified Roman forms of government. Urban centres that were wholly noncitizen, called <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119502" tocid="">civitates</xref>
                </e>, enjoyed autonomy in their own affairs, under the governor’s eye; they paid taxes and administered the rural territory around them. In the west, many of them were eventually granted the status of <e>municipia</e>, and they adopted the originally Italian magistracies (<e>duoviri</e> and <e>aediles</e>, collectively <e>quattuorviri</e>) and senate (<e>

                </e> or <e>ordo</e>), normally numbering 100 members. The entire West rapidly came under the administration of urban centres of these three forms, without which the central government could never have done its job. Moreover, these centres radiated economic and cultural influence around them and so had an immense effect, particularly on the way of life of the more backward areas. In the east, however, urban centres, though equally important for government purposes, had already been in existence and long settled into their own culture and forms of government.

              <p>The provinces were generally better off under the empire. Appointment over them as governor was now and henceforth generally granted with the emperor’s approval.

              <p>
                For this priceless gift of peace many individuals and even whole communities, in Italy and elsewhere, expressed their thanks spontaneously by worshiping Augustus and his family. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="186034" tocid="">Emperor</xref> worship was also encouraged officially, however, as a focus of common loyalty for the polyglot empire. In the provinces, to emphasize the superiority of Italy, the official cult was dedicated to Roma et Augustus; to celebrate it, representatives from provincial communities or groups of communities met in an assembly (Consilium Provinciae), which incidentally might air grievances as well as satisfactions. (This system began in the Greek-speaking provinces, long used to wooing their rulers with divine honours. It penetrated the west only slowly, but from 12 <e ty="s">bc</e> an assembly for the three imperial Gallic provinces existed at Lugdunum.) In Italy the official cult was to the <e>genius Augusti</e> (the life spirit of his family); it was coupled in Rome with the Lares Compitales (the spirits of his ancestors). Its principal custodians (<e>seviri Augustales</e>) were normally freedmen. Both the Senate and the emperor had central control over the institution. The Senate could withhold a vote of posthumous deification, and the emperor could acknowledge or refuse provincial initiatives in the establishment of emperor worship, in the construction for it, or in its liturgical details. The energy, however, that infused emperor worship was to be found almost wholly among the local nobilities.

              <headtitle>The army</headtitle>
              <p>
                It was Augustus’ soldiers, however, not his worshipers, who made him all-powerful. Their allegiance, like the name Caesar, was inherited from his “father,” the deified Julius. The allegiance was to the emperor personally, through a military oath taken in his name every January 1; and the soldiers owed it after his death to his son or chosen successor. This preference of theirs for legitimacy could not be ignored because they were now a standing army, something that the republic had lacked. Demobilization reduced the 60 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="335026" tocid="">legions</xref> of Actium to 28, a number hardly sufficient but all that Augustus’ prudence or economy would countenance. These became permanent formations, each with its own number and name; the soldiers serving in them were called legionaries. Besides the legionaries there was a somewhat smaller body of auxiliaries, or supporting troops. The two corps together numbered more than a quarter of a million men. To them must be added the garrison of Italy—the praetorian cohorts, or emperor’s bodyguard, about 10,000 strong—and the marines of the imperial fleet, which had its main headquarters at Misenum and Ravenna in Italy and subsidiary stations and flotillas on seas and rivers elsewhere (the marines, however, were not reckoned good combat forces). All these troops were long-service professionals—the praetorians serving 16 years; legionaries, 20; auxiliaries, 25; and marines, 28—with differing pay scales, the praetorians’ being the highest. In addition to their pay, the men received donatives, shares of booty, and retirement bonuses from a special treasury (<e>aerarium militare</e>) established in <e ty="s">ad</e> 6 and maintained out of the sales tax and Roman citizens’ death duties. Under Augustus the praetorians were normally Italians, but many legionaries and virtually all auxiliaries were provincials, mainly from the imperial provinces in the west, the legionaries coming from municipal towns and the auxiliaries from tribal areas. The tendency to use provincials grew, and by the year 100 the Roman imperial army was overwhelmingly non-Italian. Nevertheless, it helped greatly to Romanize the empire. The legionaries were Roman citizens from the day they enlisted, if not before, and the auxiliaries (after Claudius anyway) from the day they were discharged; and, though serving soldiers could not legally marry, many had mistresses whose children often became Roman citizens. The troops, other than praetorians and marines, passed their years of service in the “armed” imperial provinces—the auxiliaries in forts near the frontier and the legionaries at some distance from it in camps that showed an increasing tendency, especially after <e ty="s">ad</e> 69, to become permanent (some of them, indeed, developed into great European cities). There was no central reserve, because, although desirable for emergencies, it might prove dangerous in peacetime.

              <p>
                The officers were naturally Roman citizens. In the legions those of the highest rank (<e>

                </e>) might enter directly from Italian or provincial municipalities or might rise through the ranks; by the time they retired, if not sooner, many of them were equites. In the auxiliaries the unit commanders (<e>

                </e>) were equites, often of provincial birth. On retirement the soldiers frequently settled in the provinces where they had served, made friends, and perhaps acquired families. Imperial policy favoured this practice. Thus the army, which had done much to introduce into the provinces Romans of all ranks, with their own way of life, through veteran settlements of the 40s, 30s, and 20s <e ty="s">bc</e>, continued in the same role on a more modest and casual scale throughout the Augustan reign and for two centuries or so afterward.

              <p>
                After Actium and on two other occasions, Augustus solemnly closed the gates of the shrine of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="300515" tocid="">Janus</xref> (a gesture of peace) to show that Rome had peace as well as a <e>princeps</e>. These well-publicized gestures were purely temporary; the gates were swiftly reopened. His proconsular <e>imperium</e> made Augustus the arbiter of peace and war, and an ostensible search for defensible frontiers made his a very warlike reign. While the republic had left the limits of Roman territorial claims rather vague and indefinite, he planned conquests stretching to the boundaries defined by nature (deserts, rivers, and ocean shores), not always, however, with immediate annexation in mind. When annexation did occur, it was followed by the construction of solidly built military roads, paved with thick stone blocks: these also served the official post system (<e>cursus publicus</e>) and were provided with rest stages and overnight lodges at regular intervals.
              </p>
              <p>Areas where subjugation looked arduous and where Romanization seemed problematic were left to client kings, dependent on the emperor’s support and goodwill and under obligation to render military aid to Rome. Such satellite kingdoms spared Augustus the trouble and expense of maintaining strong defenses everywhere; nevertheless, their ultimate and intended destiny was incorporation as soon as it suited their overlord’s convenience. Usually, territory was gained more easily by creating and subsequently incorporating a client kingdom than by launching an expansionist war.</p>
              <p>
                In the south, Augustus found suitable frontiers quickly. In 25 <e ty="s">bc</e> an expedition under Aelius Gallus opened the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="494479" tocid="">Red Sea</xref> to Roman use and simultaneously revealed the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31610" tocid="">Arabian Desert</xref> as an unsurpassed and, indeed, unsurpassable boundary. The same year Gaius Petronius, the prefect of Egypt, tightened Rome’s grip as far as the First Cataract and established a broad military zone beyond it. The vast region north of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="516375" tocid="">Sahara</xref> and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="41302" tocid="">Atlas Mountains</xref> was also secured (<e>c.</e> 25) after a series of punitive raids against native tribes and the annexation of one client kingdom (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422426" tocid="">Numidia</xref>) and the creation of another (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370023" tocid="">Mauretania</xref>). Three legions, two in Egypt and one in Africa (a senatorial province), policed the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the west, consolidation was extended to the Atlantic. Gaul, Julius Caesar’s conquest, was organized as four provinces: senatorial <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="403437" tocid="">Narbonensis</xref> and the imperial three Gauls (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31289" tocid="">Aquitania</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="59258" tocid="">Belgica</xref>, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350938" tocid="">Lugdunensis</xref>). In Spain, after Agrippa successfully ended in 19 <e ty="s">bc</e> the last campaign that Augustus had launched in person in 26, three provinces were formed: senatorial Baetica and imperial Lusitania and Tarraconensis. Three legions enforced Roman authority from Gibraltar to the mouth of the Rhine. Augustus ignored the advice of court poets and others to advance still farther and annex Britain.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the east, Parthia had demonstrated its power against Crassus and Antony, and Augustus proceeded warily. He retained Antony’s ring of buffer client kingdoms, although he incorporated some, including the most celebrated of them, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307117" tocid="">Judaea</xref>; he made it a province in <e ty="s">ad</e> 6, respecting, however, some of the customs of its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303358" tocid="">Jewish</xref> inhabitants. Augustus stationed four legions in Syria and obviously envisaged the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="195441" tocid="">Euphrates River</xref> and the northern extension of the Arabian Desert as the desirable frontier with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="376828" tocid="">Mesopotamia</xref>. Farther north, however, no such natural line existed. North of the Black Sea the client kingdom of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="74787" tocid="">Cimmerian Bosporus</xref>, under its successive rulers Asander and Polemo, helped to contain southward and westward thrusts by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="530361" tocid="">Scythians</xref>, an Iranian people related to the Parthians, and this provided protection in the north for Anatolia and its provinces (senatorial Asia and Bithynia-Pontus and imperial Cilicia and Galatia, the latter a large new province created in 25 <e ty="s">bc</e> out of Amyntas’ client kingdom). By a show of force, Augustus’ stepson <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="594862" tocid="">Tiberius</xref>, in 20 <e ty="s">bc</e>, recovered the standards lost at Carrhae and installed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="595564" tocid="">Tigranes</xref> as client king of Armenia. Although Augustan propaganda depicted this as a famous victory, strategic considerations inevitably obliged the Parthians, once they settled their internal, dynastic dissensions, to dispute Roman control of Armenia. Thus it can hardly be said that Augustus settled the eastern frontier. Missions were sent to the East repeatedly (Agrippa, 17–13 <e ty="s">bc</e>; Gaius Caesar, <e ty="s">ad</e> 1–4; Germanicus, 18–19), and Armenia remained a problem for Augustus’ successors: Tiberius successfully maintained Roman influence there, but Gaius and Claudius failed to do so, leaving Nero with a difficult situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the north, too, there was difficulty. The Alps and their passes were finally subjugated early in Augustus’ reign. This enabled Tiberius and his brother <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="172180" tocid="">Drusus</xref> between 16 and 8 <e ty="s">bc</e> to conquer all the way to the great rivers of central Europe. New provinces were created in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365496" tocid="">Alps and Tyrol</xref> (Maritime and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450070" tocid="">Pennine Alps</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="489424" tocid="">Raetia</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418182" tocid="">Noricum</xref>) and also farther east (Pannonia, Moesia). Stability along the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="151250" tocid="">Danube</xref> was precariously maintained, under Augustus and later, by means of periodical alliances with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365993" tocid="">Maroboduus</xref> and his successors, who ruled Germanic tribes such as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364278" tocid="">Marcomanni</xref> and Quadi in Bohemia to the north of the river, and by the existence of a Thracian client kingdom to the south of its lowest course. The push across the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501316" tocid="">Rhine</xref> began in 12 <e ty="s">bc</e>; although it reached the Elbe, consolidation beyond the Rhine proved elusive. A revolt in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441428" tocid="">Pannonia</xref> (<e ty="s">ad</e> 6–9) interrupted it, and, in <e ty="s">ad</e> 9, German tribes under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="35390" tocid="">Arminius</xref> annihilated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="623607" tocid="">Quinctilius Varus</xref> and three legions in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="589190" tocid="">Teutoburg Forest</xref>. This disaster reduced the number of legions to 25 (it did not reach 28 again until half a century later), and it disheartened Augustus. Old and weary, he withdrew to the Rhine and decided against all further expansion, a policy he urged upon his successor. For the watch on the Rhine the military districts of Upper and Lower Germany were created, containing eight legions between them. Another seven garrisoned the Danubian provinces. These figures reveal imperial anxiety for the northern frontier.

              <p>
                Although widespread, Augustus’ wars chiefly affected the frontier districts. Elsewhere, peace prevailed. Indeed, never before had so large an area been free of war for so long. This state of affairs helped trade. The suppression of piracy and the use of military roads, which the frontier warfare itself brought into being, provided safe arteries of commerce. Stable currency also aided <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178400" tocid="">economic growth</xref>. Activity directly connected with the soil predominated; but there were also many establishments, usually small, engaged in manufacturing, and such products as textiles, pottery, tiles, and papyrus were turned out in surprising quantities. Advanced techniques were also known: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="235045" tocid="">glassblowing</xref>, for example, dates from the Augustan age. Most products were consumed locally, but the specialties or monopolies from any region usually exceeded local needs, and the surplus was sold elsewhere, generating a brisk interchange of goods. Some traveled great distances, even beyond the empire: trade with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="285248" tocid="">India</xref>, for example, reached respectable proportions once the nature of the monsoon was understood, and the Red Sea was opened to Roman shipping. Merchants, especially Levantines, traveled everywhere, and fairs were frequent. The Mediterranean world was linked together as never before, and standardization made considerable headway. In Augustus’ day Italy was economically the most important part of the empire. It could afford to import on a large scale, thanks partly to provincial tribute but above all to its own large productivity. The eastern provinces, for their part, recovered rapidly from the depredations of the civil wars and were industrially quite advanced. The other provinces were less developed, but they soon ceased being mere suppliers of raw materials; they learned to exploit their natural resources by using new techniques and then began overtaking the more advanced economies of Italy and the Greek-speaking regions. The importance of trade in unifying the empire should not be underestimated.

                The culture of the age undoubtedly attained a high level of excellence, dominated by the personality of the emperor and his accomplishments. Imperial art had already reached full development, a matter of no small moment, because Rome’s political predominance made the spread of its influence inevitable. The Mediterranean world was soon assuming a Roman aspect, and this is a measure of Augustus’ extraordinary achievement. Yet it was an achievement with limitations. His professed aim—to promote stability, peace, security, and prosperity—was irreproachable, but perhaps it was also unexciting. Emphasizing conservatism by precept and his own example, he encouraged the simpler virtues of a less sophisticated age, and his success made this sedate but rather static outlook fashionable. People accepted the routine of his continuing rule, at the cost, however, of some loss of intellectual energy and moral fervour. The great literature, significantly, belongs to the years near Actium, when people’s imagination still nursed heady visions of Roman victory and Italian destiny. After the Secular Games the atmosphere became more commonplace and produced the frivolities of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="436057" tocid="">Ovid</xref> and the pedestrian later books of Livy.

              <p>In discharging both military and civilian functions, Augustus was no different from republican consuls or praetors. Admittedly his military power was overwhelming; but, if he chose not to brandish it, the tone of his reign could remain essentially civilian. Constitutional safeguards were indeed lacking; everything was at the emperor’s discretion, and even Augustus passed legislation that made anti-imperial behaviour, real or suspected, treasonable (men were, in fact, executed for conspiracy during his reign). But there had been no constitutional safeguards in the republic, under Sulla, Pompey, the triumvirs, or even Julius Caesar. Augustus’ improved police services probably made lower-class Romans at least feel safer under him. The senatorial class, however, contained a minority resentful of the sheer undeniable preponderance of the princeps’ power, and he was the target of several unsuccessful plots against his life.</p>
              <p>
                The principate was something personal, what the emperor chose to make it, and the relations prevailing between emperor and Senate usually indicated what a reign was like. In Augustus’ case they reveal a regime that was outwardly constitutional, generally moderate, and certainly effective. But, as he himself implied at the end of his life, he was a skillful actor in life’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127459" tocid="">comedy</xref>. Later emperors lacked his sureness of touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Augustus died, the Senate unhesitatingly pronounced him <e>divus</e>—the deified one who had restored peace, organized a standing army to defend the frontiers, expanded those frontiers farther than any previous Roman, improved administrative practices everywhere, promoted better standards of public and private behaviour, integrated Rome and Italy, embellished Rome, reconciled the provinces, expedited Romanization, and above all maintained law and order while respecting republican traditions.
              </p>
              <p>Augustus’ luck was hardly inferior to his statecraft. Despite indifferent health, he headed the Roman state in one capacity or another for 56 years. His rule, one of the longest in European history, consolidated the principate so firmly that what might have been an episode became an epoch. At his death there was practically no one left with any personal memory of the republic, and Augustus’ wish came true: he had fashioned a lasting as well as constitutional government. The principate endured with only minor changes for about 200 years.</p>

              <headtitle>The succession</headtitle>
              <p>
                Like any great Roman magnate, Augustus owed it to his supporters and dependents to maintain the structure of power which they constituted together and which would normally pass from father to son. In accepting the heritage from Caesar, he had only done the right thing, and he was respected for it by his peers. None of them would have advised him later to dismantle what he had since added to it. When, for instance, he was away from Rome, rather than accepting a diminution in his prerogatives of administration, a senator as city prefect was deputed to represent him. Consequently, Augustus began thinking early about who should follow him. The soldiers’ views on legitimacy reinforced his own natural desire to found a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307912" tocid="">dynasty</xref>, but he had no son and was therefore obliged to select his successor. Death played havoc with his attempts to do so. His nephew Marcellus, his son-in-law Agrippa, his grandsons Gaius and Lucius (Julia’s children by Agrippa), were groomed in turn; but they all predeceased him. Augustus, finally and reluctantly, chose a member of the republican nobility, his stepson <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="594862" tocid="">Tiberius</xref>, a scion of the ultra-aristocratic Claudii. In <e ty="s">ad</e> 4 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43047" tocid="">Augustus</xref> adopted Tiberius as his son and had tribunician power and probably proconsular <e>imperium</e> as well conferred upon him. This arrangement was confirmed in 13, and, when Augustus died the following year, Tiberius automatically became emperor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tiberius (ruled 14–37), during whose reign Christ was crucified, was a soldier and administrator of proved capability but of a reserved and moody temperament that engendered misunderstanding and unpopularity. Slander blamed him for the death in 19 of his nephew and heir apparent, the popular <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="231118" tocid="">Germanicus</xref>; and, when informers (<e>delatores</e>), who functioned at Rome like <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479366" tocid="">public prosecutors</xref>, charged notables with treason, Tiberius was thought to encourage them. By concentrating the praetorian cohorts in a camp adjoining Rome, he increased the soldiers’ scope for mischief-making without building any real security, and in 26 he left Rome permanently for the island of Capreae (Capri), entrusting Rome to the care of the city prefect. Tiberius heeded the aged Augustus’ advice and did not extend the empire. (The annexation of Cappadocia, a client kingdom, represented no departure from Augustan policy.) In general he took his duties seriously; however, by administering the empire from Capreae he offended the Senate and was never fully trusted, much less really liked. At his death he was not pronounced <e>divus</e>. His great-nephew, Germanicus’ son Gaius, succeeded him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gaius (better known by his nickname, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="89691" tocid="">Caligula</xref>, meaning Little Boot) ruled from 37 to 41 with the absolutism of an Oriental monarch: his short reign was filled with reckless spending, callous murders, and humiliation of the Senate. Gaius’ <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="213380" tocid="">foreign policy</xref> was inept. Projected annexation proved abortive in Britain; it touched off heavy fighting in Mauretania. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307117" tocid="">Judaea</xref> and Alexandria, Gaius’ contemptuous disregard of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303358" tocid="">Jewish</xref> sentiment provoked near rebellion. When assassination ended his tyranny, the Senate contemplated restoration of the republic but was obliged by the Praetorian Guard to recognize <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120493" tocid="">Claudius</xref>, Germanicus’ brother and therefore Gaius’ uncle, as emperor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claudius I (ruled 41–54) went far beyond Augustus and Tiberius in centralizing <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482290" tocid="">government administration</xref> and, particularly, state finances in the imperial household. His freedmen secretaries consequently acquired great power; they were in effect directors of government bureaus. Claudius himself displayed much interest in the empire overseas; he enlarged it significantly, incorporating client kingdoms (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370023" tocid="">Mauretania</xref> in 42; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352533" tocid="">Lycia</xref>, 43; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="593540" tocid="">Thrace</xref>, 46) and, more important, annexing Britain. Conquest of Britain began in 43, Claudius himself participating in the campaign; the southeast was soon overrun, a <e>colonia</e> established at Camulodunum (Colchester) and a <e>municipium</e> at Verulamium (St. Albans), while Londinium (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346821" tocid="">London</xref>) burgeoned into an important entrepôt. Claudius also promoted Romanization, especially in the western provinces, by liberally granting Roman citizenship, by founding <e>coloniae</e>, and by inducting provincials directly into the Senate—he became censor in 47 and added to the Senate men he wanted, bestowing appropriate quaestorian or praetorian rank upon them to spare the maturer ones among them the necessity of holding junior magistracies; lest existing senators take offense, he elevated some of them to patrician status (a form of patronage often used by later emperors). Claudius’ provincial policies made the primacy of Italy less pronounced, although that was hardly his aim. In fact, he did much for Italy, improving its harbours, roads, and municipal administration and draining its marshy districts. The execution of many senators and equites, the insolence and venality of his freedmen, the excessive influence of his wives, and even his bodily infirmities combined to make him unpopular. Nevertheless, when he died (murdered probably by his fourth wife, <xref refid="1960709" ty="1" topicid="9818" tocid="">Julia Agrippina</xref>, Augustus’ great-granddaughter, who was impatient for the succession of the 16-year-old <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409505" tocid="">Nero</xref>, her son by an earlier marriage), he was pronounced <e>divus</e>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nero (ruled 54–68) left administration to capable advisers for a few years but then asserted himself as a vicious despot. He murdered successively his stepbrother Britannicus, his mother Julia Agrippina, his wife Octavia, and his tutor Seneca. He also executed many Christians, accusing them of starting the great fire of Rome in 64 (this is the first recorded Christian persecution). In Rome his reliance on Oriental favourites and his general misgovernment led to a conspiracy by Gaius Calpurnius Piso in 65, but it was suppressed, leading to yet more executions; the victims included the poet Lucan. The empire was not enlarged under this unwarlike emperor, but it was called upon to put down serious disorders. In Britain in 60–61 the rapacity and brutality of Roman officials provoked a furious uprising under Queen <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="75413" tocid="">Boudicca</xref>; thousands were slaughtered, and Camulodunum, Vernulamium, and Londinium were destroyed. In the east a major military effort under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="137215" tocid="">Corbulo</xref>, Rome’s foremost general, was required (62–65) to reestablish Roman prestige; a compromise settlement was reached, with the Romans accepting the Parthian nominee in Armenia and the Parthians recognizing him as Rome’s client king. In 66, however, revolt flared in Judaea, fired by Roman cruelty and stupidity, Jewish fanaticism, and communal hatreds; the prefect of Egypt, Julius Alexander, prevented involvement of the Jews of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="161756" tocid="">Diaspora</xref>. An army was sent to Judaea under Titus Flavius Vespasianus to restore order; but it had not completed its task when two provincial governors in the west rebelled against Nero—Julius Vindex in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350938" tocid="">Gallia Lugdunensis</xref> and Sulpicius Galba in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="266944" tocid="">Hispania</xref> Tarraconensis. When the praetorians in Rome also renounced their allegiance, Nero lost his nerve and committed suicide. He brought the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307912" tocid="">Julio-Claudian dynasty</xref> to an ignominious end by being the first emperor to suffer <e>damnatio memoriae</e>—his reign was officially stricken from the record by order of the Senate.

              <p>
                Nero’s death ushered in the so-called year of the four emperors. The extinction of the Julio-Claudian imperial house robbed the soldiers of a focus for their allegiance, and civil war between the different armies ensued. The army of Upper Germany, after crushing <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629389" tocid="">Vindex</xref>, urged its commander, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626049" tocid="">Verginius Rufus</xref>, to seize the purple for himself. But he elected to support <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223861" tocid="">Galba</xref>—scion of a republican patrician family claiming descent from Jupiter and Pasiphae—who was recognized as emperor by the Senate. However, the treasury, emptied by Nero’s extravagance, imposed a stringent economy, and this bred unpopularity for Galba; his age (73) was also against him, and unrest grew. Early in January 69 the Rhineland armies acclaimed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="631209" tocid="">Aulus Vitellius</xref>, commander in Lower Germany; at Rome the praetorians preferred <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="434674" tocid="">Marcus Salvius Otho</xref>, whom Galba had alienated by choosing a descendant of the old republican aristocracy for his successor. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="434674" tocid="">Otho</xref> promptly procured Galba’s murder and obtained senatorial recognition; this ended the monopoly of the purple for the republican nobility.

              <p>
                Otho, however, lasted only three months; defeated at Bedriacum, near Cremona in northern Italy, by Vitellius’ powerful Rhineland army, he committed suicide (April 69). The Senate thereupon recognized Vitellius; but the soldiers along the Danube and in the east supported <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626856" tocid="">Vespasianus</xref>, the commander in Judaea.

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                On Dec. 22, 69, the Senate conferred all the imperial powers upon Vespasian <e>en bloc</e> with the famous Lex de Imperio Vespasiani (“Law Regulating Vespasian’s authority”), and the Assembly ratified the Senate’s action. This apparently was the first time that such a law was passed; a fragmentary copy of it is preserved on the Capitol in Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vespasian (ruled 69–79) did not originate from Rome or its aristocracy. His family came from the Sabine municipality Reate, and with his elevation the Italian bourgeoisie came into its own. He and his two sons, both of whom in turn succeeded him, constituted the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="209780" tocid="">Flavian dynasty</xref> (69–96). Vespasian faced the same difficult task as Augustus—the restoration of peace and stability. The disorders of 69 had taken troops away from the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Thereupon, the Danubian lands were raided by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="524377" tocid="">Sarmatians</xref>, a combination of tribes who had overwhelmed and replaced the Scythians, their distant kinsmen, in eastern Europe. The assailants were repelled without undue difficulty; but the Sarmatian Iazyges, now firmly in control of the region between the Tisza and Danube rivers, posed a threat for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developments in the Rhineland were more immediately serious. There in 69 a certain <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119465" tocid="">Civilis</xref> incited the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55763" tocid="">Batavians</xref> serving as auxiliaries in the Roman army to rebel. Gallic tribes joined the movement, and the insurgents boldly overran all but two of the legionary camps along the Rhine. Vespasian sent his relative Petilius Cerealis to deal with the rebels, who, fortunately for Rome, were not united in their aims; by 70 Cerealis had restored order. That same year Vespasian’s elder son, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="597352" tocid="">Titus</xref>, brought the bloody war in Judaea to its end by besieging, capturing, and destroying Jerusalem.
              </p>
              <p>To rehabilitate the public finances, Vespasian introduced new imposts, including a poll tax on Jews, and practiced stringent economies. With the Senate he was courteous but firm. He allowed it little initiative but used it as a reservoir from which to obtain capable administrators. To that end he assumed the censorship and added senators on a larger scale than Claudius had done, especially from the municipalities of Italy and the western provinces. Already before 69 an aristocracy of service had arisen, and the provincialization of the Roman Senate had begun; thereafter this development made rapid headway. Besides the censorship, Vespasian also often held the consulship, usually with Titus as his colleague. His object presumably was to ensure that his own parvenu Flavian house outranked any other. In this he succeeded; the troops especially were ready to accept the Flavians as the new imperial family. On Vespasian’s death in 79, Titus, long groomed for the succession, became emperor and immediately had his father deified.</p>
              <p>
                Titus (ruled 79–81) had a brief reign, marred by disasters (the volcanic eruption that buried <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469420" tocid="">Pompeii</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="262793" tocid="">Herculaneum</xref> and another great fire in Rome); but his attempts to alleviate the suffering and his general openhandedness won him such popularity that he was unhesitatingly deified after his early death.
              </p>
              <p>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="168802" tocid="">Domitian</xref> (ruled 81–96), Titus’ younger brother, had never been formally indicated for the succession; but the praetorians acclaimed him, and the Senate ratified their choice. Throughout his reign Domitian aimed at administrative efficiency, but his methods were high-handed. For him the Senate existed merely to supply imperial servants. He also used equites extensively, more than any previous emperor. He held the consulship repeatedly, was <e>censor perpetuus</e> from 85 on, and demanded other extravagant honours. On the whole, his efficiency promoted the welfare of the empire. Above all, he retained the allegiance of the troops. Although scornful of the Senate’s dignity, he insisted on his own and mercilessly punished any act of disrespect, real or fancied, toward himself. He became even more suspicious and ruthless when Saturninus, commander in Upper Germany, attempted rebellion in 89. He crushed Saturninus; executions and confiscations ensued, and <e>delatores</e> flourished. The tyranny was particularly dangerous to senators, and it ended only with Domitian’s assassination in 96. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="209780" tocid="">Flavian dynasty</xref>, like the Julio-Claudian, ended with an emperor whose memory was officially damned.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disorders in 69 were the cause of some military reforms. Under the Flavians, auxiliaries usually served far from their native hearths under officers of different nationality from themselves. At the same time, the tasks assigned to them came increasingly to resemble those performed by the legionaries. The latter grew less mobile, as camps with stone buildings came to be the rule; and it became common for detachments from a legion (<e>vexillationes</e>), rather than the entire legion, to be used for field operations. This army of a new type proved its mettle in Britain, where the advance halted by Boudicca’s revolt was now resumed. Between 71 and 84 three able governors—Petilius Cerealis, Julius Frontinus, and Julius <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="9529" tocid="">Agricola</xref>, the latter Tacitus’ father-in-law—enlarged the province to include Wales and northern England; Agricola even reached the Scottish highlands before Domitian recalled him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the Rhine, weaknesses revealed by Civilis’ revolt were repaired. Vespasian crossed the river in 74 and annexed the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="9510" tocid="">Agri Decumates</xref>, the triangle of land between the Rhine, Danube, and Main rivers. To consolidate the position, he and Domitian after him penetrated the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="407707" tocid="">Neckar River</xref> valley and Taunus mountains, and fortifications began to take shape to the east of the Rhine, a military boundary complete with strongpoints, watchtowers, and, later, a continuous rampart of earthworks and palisades. Once Saturninus’ revolt in 89 had been suppressed, Domitian felt the situation along the Rhine sufficiently stable to warrant conversion of the military districts of Upper and Lower Germany into regular provinces and the transfer of some Rhineland troops to the Danube. To the north of this latter river, the Dacians had been organized into a strong kingdom, ruled by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154992" tocid="">Decebalus</xref> and centring on modern Romania; in 85 they raided southward across the Danube, and in the next year they defeated the Roman punitive expedition. Domitian restored the situation in 88, but Saturninus’ rebellion prevented him from following up his success. Domitian and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154992" tocid="">Decebalus</xref> thereupon came to terms: Decebalus was to protect the lower Danube against Sarmatian attack, and Domitian was to pay him an annual subsidy in recompense. The Danubian frontier, however, remained disturbed, and Domitian wisely strengthened its garrisons; by the end of his reign it contained nine legions, as against the Rhineland’s six, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441428" tocid="">Pannonia</xref> was soon to become the military <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="242556" tocid="">centre of gravity</xref> of the empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Flavians also took measures to strengthen the eastern frontier. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22897" tocid="">Asia Minor</xref>, Vespasian created a large “armed” province by amalgamating Cappadocia, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="343962" tocid="">Lesser Armenia</xref>, and Galatia; and the whole area was provided with a network of military roads. South of Asia Minor, Judaea was converted into an “armed” province by getting legionary troops; and two client kingdoms—Commagene and Transjordan—were annexed and added to Syria. Furthermore, the legionary camps seem now to have been established right on the Euphrates at the principal river crossings. This display of military strength kept the empire and Parthia at peace for many years.

Unrest subsided only when, overlooking kinsmen of his own, he adopted an outstanding soldier, Marcus Ulpius Trajanus, who was governor of Upper Germany, as his successor. Nerva himself died a few months later.

              <p>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="602150" tocid="">Trajan</xref> (ruled 98–117) was the first and perhaps the only emperor to be adopted by a predecessor totally unrelated to him by either birth or marriage. He was also the first in a series of “good” rulers who succeeded one another by adoption and for most of the 2nd century provided the empire with internal harmony and careful government; they are collectively, if somewhat loosely, called the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28759" tocid="">Antonine</xref> emperors. More significantly still, Trajan, a Spaniard, was also the first princeps to come from the provinces; with the greater number of provincials now in the Senate, the elevation of one of them, sooner or later, was practically inevitable. Throughout his reign, Trajan generally observed constitutional practices. Mindful of the susceptibilities of the Senate, he regularly consulted and reported to it. Modest in his bearing, he did not claim ostentatious honours such as frequent consulships or numerous imperial salutations, and he mixed easily with senators on terms of cordial friendship. This reestablished mutual respect between princeps and Senate. Empire and liberty, in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579997" tocid="">Tacitus’</xref> words, were reconciled, and the atmosphere of suspicion, intrigue, and terror surrounding the court in Domitian’s day disappeared. Trajan endeared himself also to the populace at large with lavish building programs, gladiatorial games, and public distributions of money. Above all, he was popular with the armed forces; he was the soldier-emperor par excellence. Understandably, he received the title Optimus (Best), officially from 114 on (and unofficially for many years earlier).
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet Trajan was a thoroughgoing autocrat who intervened without hesitation or scruple even in the senatorial sphere, whenever it seemed necessary. His aim was efficiency; his desire was to promote public welfare everywhere. He embellished Rome with splendid and substantial structures, and he showed his care for Italy by refurbishing and enlarging the harbours at Ostia, Centumcellae, and Ancona. He sent officials called <e>curatores</e> to Italian municipalities in financial difficulties and helped to rehabilitate them. He greatly expanded an ingenious charity scheme probably begun by Nerva: money was loaned to farmers on easy terms, and the low interest they paid went into a special fund for supporting indigent children. Nor did Trajan neglect Italy’s highway network: he built a new road (Via Traiana) that soon replaced the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30587" tocid="">Via Appia</xref> as the main thoroughfare between Beneventum and Brundisium.

                Interest in Italy implied no neglect of the provinces. <e>Curatores</e> were also sent to them; to rescue Achaea and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="67192" tocid="">Bithynia</xref>, senatorial provinces, from threatened bankruptcy, Trajan made them both temporarily imperial, sending special commissioners of his own to them. His correspondence with his appointee in Bithynia, the younger Pliny, has survived and reveals how conscientiously the emperor responded on even the smallest details. At the same time, it reveals how limited was access to the central government and, consequently, how great a latitude for independent decisions must be left to the governors who lacked some special claim on the emperor’s attention. Trajan’s day was too short to hear every speech of every delegation from the provinces, every recommendation to bestow favour or grant promotion, and every appeal to himself as supreme judiciary. To assist him, he had a “bureaucracy” of only a few hundred in Rome and a few more hundred serving in various capacities in the provinces—to direct the lives of some 60 million people. Clearly, most government must in fact rest in the hands of local aristocracies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the military sphere, Trajan’s reign proved a most dynamic one. He decided to strengthen the dangerous Danube frontier by converting <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="149413" tocid="">Dacia</xref> into a salient of Roman territory north of the river in order to dismember the Sarmatian tribes and remove the risk of large, hostile combinations to a safer distance. Bringing to bear a force of 100,000 men, he conquered <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154992" tocid="">Decebalus</xref> in two hard-fought wars (101–102; 105–106) and annexed Dacia, settling it with people from neighbouring parts of the empire. On the eastern frontier he planned a similar operation, evidently in the conviction, shared by many eminent Romans both before and after him, that only conquest could solve the Parthian problem. Possibly, too, he wished to contain the menace of the Sarmatian Alani in the Caspian region. In a preliminary move, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="401246" tocid="">Nabataean</xref> kingdom of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31566" tocid="">Arabia</xref> Petraea was annexed in 105–106. Then, in 114, Trajan assembled another large army, incorporated the client kingdom of Armenia, and invaded Parthia.
              </p>
              <p>
                After spectacular victories in 115 and 116, he created additional provinces (Northern Mesopotamia, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="39555" tocid="">Assyria</xref>) and reached the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="452764" tocid="">Persian Gulf</xref>. But he had merely overrun Mesopotamia; he had not consolidated it, and, as his army passed, revolts broke out in its rear. The Jews of the Diaspora and others seized their chance to rebel, and before the end of 116 much of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="381192" tocid="">Middle East</xref> besides Parthia was in arms (Cyrene, Egypt, Cyprus, Anatolia). Trajan proceeded resolutely to restore the situation, but death found him still in the East.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before his last illness he had not formally indicated his successor. But high honours and important posts had been accorded his nearest male relative, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="251204" tocid="">Publius Aelius Hadrianus</xref>, the governor of Syria; and, according to Trajan’s widow, Hadrian had actually been adopted by Trajan on his deathbed. Accordingly, both Senate and soldiers recognized him. Trajan’s posthumous deification was never in doubt.

                </thumbasm>Hadrian (ruled 117–138), also a Spaniard, was an emperor of unusual versatility. Unlike Trajan, he was opposed to territorial expansion. Being himself in the East in 117, he renounced Trajan’s conquests there immediately and contemplated evacuating Dacia as well. Furthermore, four of the consular generals particularly identified with Trajan’s military ventures were arrested and executed “for conspiracy”; Hadrian claimed later that the Senate ordered their deaths against his wishes. The only heavy fighting during his generally peaceful reign occurred in Judaea—or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439645" tocid="">Syria Palaestina</xref>, as it was thenceforth called—where <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52477" tocid="">Bar Kokhba</xref> led a furious, if futile, Jewish revolt (132–135) against Hadrian’s conversion of Jerusalem into a Roman colony named <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="7079" tocid="">Aelia Capitolina</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of expansion by war, Hadrian sought carefully delimited but well-defended frontiers, with client states beyond them where possible. The frontiers themselves, when not natural barriers, were strongly fortified: in Britain, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="251254" tocid="">Hadrian’s Wall</xref>, a complex of ditches, mounds, forts, and stone wall, stretched across the island from the Tyne to the Solway; Germany and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="489424" tocid="">Raetia</xref> had a <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="341333" tocid="">limes</xref>
                </e> (fortified boundary) running between Mainz on the Rhine and Regensburg on the Danube. Within the frontiers the army was kept at full strength, mostly by local recruiting of legionaries and apparently of auxiliaries, too (so that Vespasian’s system of having the latter serve far from their homelands gradually ceased). Moreover, the tendency for auxiliaries to be assimilated to legionaries continued; even the officers became less distinguishable, because equites now sometimes replaced senators in high posts in the legions. To keep his essentially sedentary army in constant readiness and at peak efficiency (no easy task), Hadrian carried out frequent personal inspections, spending about half his reign in the provinces (121–125; 128–134).
              </p>
              <p>
                Hadrian also was responsible for significant developments on the civilian side. Under him, equites were no longer required to do military service as an essential step in their career, and many of them were employed in the imperial <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119404" tocid="">civil service</xref>, more even than under Domitian. By now the formative days of the civil service were over; its bureaucratic phase was beginning, and it offered those equites who had no military aspirations an attractive, purely civilian career. Formal titles now marked the different equestrian grades of dignity: a procurator was <e>vir egregius</e>; an ordinary prefect, <e>vir perfectissimus</e>; a praetorian prefect, <e>vir eminentissimus</e>, the latter title being obviously parallel to the designation <e>vir clarissimus</e> for a senator. Thenceforth, equites replaced freedmen in the imperial household and bureaus, and they even appeared in Hadrian’s imperial council.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hadrian also improved legal administration. He had his expert jurists codify the <e>edictum perpetuum</e> (the set of rules gradually elaborated by the praetors for the interpretation of the law). He also appointed four former consuls to serve as circuit judges in Italy. This brought Italy close to becoming a province; Hadrian’s intent, however, was not to reduce the status of Italy but to make all parts of the empire important. For one part of his realm, he was exceptionally solicitous: he spent much time in Greece and lavishly embellished Athens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hadrian maintained good relations with but was never fully trusted by the Senate. His foreign policy seemed to be unheroic, his cosmopolitanism to be un-Roman, and his reforms to encroach on activities traditionally reserved for senators. Moreover, in his last two years he was sometimes capricious and tyrannous. Like Augustus, he had no son of his own and conducted a frustrating search for a successor. After executing his only male blood relative, his grandnephew, in 136, he adopted <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626756" tocid="">Lucius Ceionius Commodus</xref>, renaming him Lucius Aelius Caesar. The latter, however, died shortly afterward, whereupon Hadrian in 138 chose a wealthy but sonless senator, the 51-year-old Titus Aurelius Antoninus; but, evidently intent on founding a dynasty, he made Antoninus in his turn adopt two youths, 16 and 7 years old, respectively—they are known to history as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364331" tocid="">Marcus Aurelius</xref> (the nephew of Antoninus’ wife) and Lucius Verus (the son of Aelius Caesar). When Hadrian died soon thereafter, Antoninus succeeded and induced a reluctant Senate to deify the deceased emperor. According to some, it was this act of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="273807" tocid="">filial piety</xref> that won for Antoninus his cognomen, Pius.
              </p>
              <p>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28784" tocid="">Antoninus Pius</xref> (ruled 138–161) epitomizes the Roman Empire at its cosmopolitan best. He himself was of Gallic origin; his wife was of Spanish origin. For most men his was a reign of quiet prosperity, and the empire under him deserves the praises lavished upon it by the contemporary writer Aelius Aristides. Unlike Hadrian, Antoninus traveled little; he remained in Italy, where in 148 he celebrated the 900th anniversary of Rome. Princeps and Senate were on excellent terms, and coins with the words <e>tranquillitas</e> and <e>concordia</e> on them in Antoninus’ case mean what they say. Other of his coins not unreasonably proclaim <e>felicitas temporum</e> (“the happiness of the times”). Yet raids and rebellions in many of the borderlands (in Britain, Dacia, Mauretania, Egypt, Palaestina, and elsewhere) were danger symptoms, even though to the empire at large they seemed only faraway bad dreams, to use the expression of Aelius Aristides. Antoninus prudently pushed the Hadrianic frontiers forward in Dacia, the Rhineland, and Britain (where the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28766" tocid="">Antonine Wall</xref> from the Firth of Forth to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="122667" tocid="">River Clyde</xref> became the new boundary) and carefully groomed his heir apparent for his imperial responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364331" tocid="">Marcus Aurelius</xref> (ruled 161–180) succeeded the deified Antoninus and more than honoured Hadrian’s intentions by immediately co-opting Lucius Verus as his full co-emperor. Because Verus’ competence was unproved, this excess of zeal was imprudent. Fortunately, Verus left decision making to Marcus. Marcus’ action was also dangerous for another reason; it represented a long step away from imperial unity and portended the ultimate division of the empire into Greek- and Latin-speaking halves. Nor was this the only foreboding development in Marcus’ reign—formidable barbarian assaults were launched against the frontiers, anticipating those that were later to bring about the disintegration of the empire. Marcus himself was a stoic philosopher; his humanistic, if somewhat pessimistic, <e>Meditations</e> reveal how conscientiously he took his duties. Duty called him to war; he responded to the call and spent far more of his reign in the field than had any previous emperor.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Marcus’ very accession the Parthians turned aggressive, and he sent Verus to defend Roman interests (162). Verus greedily took credit for any victories but left serious fighting to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="45781" tocid="">Avidius Cassius</xref> and the army of Syria. Cassius succeeded in overrunning Mesopotamia and even took <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="145480" tocid="">Ctesiphon</xref>, the Parthian capital; he was therefore able to conclude a peace that safeguarded Rome’s eastern provinces and client kingdoms (166). In the process, however, his troops became infected with plague, and they carried it back with them to the west with calamitous results. The Danube frontier, already weakened by the dispatch of large detachments to the East, collapsed under barbarian assault. Pressed on from behind by Goths, Vandals, Lombards, and others, the Germanic Marcomanni and Quadi and the Sarmatian Iazyges poured over the river; the Germans actually crossed Raetia, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418182" tocid="">Noricum</xref>, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441428" tocid="">Pannonia</xref> to raid northern Italy and besiege <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31200" tocid="">Aquileia</xref>. Marcus and Verus relieved the city shortly before Verus’ death (169). Then, making Pannonia his pivot of maneuver, Marcus pushed the invaders back; by 175 they were again beyond the Danube. At that moment, however, a false report of Marcus’ death prompted Avidius Cassius, by now in charge of all eastern provinces, to proclaim himself emperor. The news of this challenge undid Marcus’ achievements along the Danube because it took him to the East and reopened the door to barbarian attacks. Fortunately, Cassius was soon murdered, and Marcus could return to central Europe (177). But he had barely restored the frontier again when he died at Vindobona (Vienna) in 180, bequeathing the empire to his son, the 19-year-old <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="128108" tocid="">Commodus</xref>, who had actually been named coemperor three years earlier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commodus (ruled 180–192), like Gaius and Nero, the youthful emperors before him, proved incompetent, conceited, and capricious. Fortunately, the frontiers remained intact, thanks to able provincial governors and to barbarian allies, who had been settled along the Danube with land grants and who gave military service in return. But Commodus abandoned Marcus’ scheme for new trans-Danubian provinces, preferring to devote himself to sensual pleasures and especially to the excitements of the arena in Rome, where he posed as Hercules Romanus and forced the Senate to recognize his godhead officially. He left serious business to his favourites, whose ambitions and intrigues led to plots, treason trials, confiscations, and insensate murders. Commodus’ assassination on the last day of 192 terminated a disastrous reign; thus the Antonines, like the Julio-Claudians, had come to an ignominious end. And there was a similar sequel. Commodus’ <e>damnatio memoriae</e>, like Nero’s, was followed by a year of four emperors.

            <headtitle>The empire in the 2nd century</headtitle>
            <p>The century and three-quarters after Augustus’ death brought no fundamental changes to the principate, although so long a lapse of time naturally introduced modifications and shifts of emphasis. By Flavian and Antonine times the principate was accepted universally. For the provinces, a return to the republic was utterly unthinkable; for Rome and Italy, the year 69 served as a grim warning of the chaos to be expected if, in the absence of a princeps, the ambitions of a few powerful individuals obtained unfettered scope. A princeps was clearly a necessity, and people were even prepared to tolerate a bad one, although naturally they always hoped for a good one.</p>
            <p>The princeps, moreover, did not have to be chosen any longer from the Julio-Claudians. The great achievement of the Flavians was to reconcile the soldiers and the upper classes everywhere to the idea that others were eligible. The Flavians’ frequent tenure of consulship and censorship invested their family, though not of the highest nobility, with the outward trappings of prestige and the aristocratic appearance of an authentic imperial household. The deification of the first two Flavians contributed to the same end, and so did the disappearance of old republican families that might have outranked the reigning house (by 69 most descendants of the republican nobility had either died of natural causes or been exterminated by imperial persecution). After the Flavians, the newness of a man’s senatorial dignity and the obscurity of his ultimate origin, whether it was Italian or otherwise, no longer forbade his possible elevation. Indeed, Domitian’s successors and even Domitian himself in his last years did not need to enhance their own importance by repeated consulships. The Antonine emperors, like the Julio-Claudians, held the office infrequently. They did, however, continue the Flavian practice of emphasizing the loftiness of their families by deifying deceased relatives (Trajan deified his sister, his niece, and his father; Antoninus, his wife; and so forth).</p>

              <headtitle>Trend to absolute monarchy</headtitle>
              <p>
                Glorification of the reigning house, together with a document such as Vespasian’s Lex de Imperio, helped to advertise the emperor’s position; and under the Flavians and Antonines the principate became much more like an avowed monarchy. Proconsular <e>imperium</e> began to be reflected in the imperial titulary, and official documents started calling the emperor <e>dominus noster</e> (“our master”).
              </p>
              <p>
                The development of imperial law-making clearly illustrates the change. From the beginnings of the principate, the emperor had had the power to legislate, although no law is known that formally recognized his right to do so; by Antonine times, legal textbooks stated unequivocally that whatever the emperor ordered was legally binding. The early emperors usually made the Senate their mouthpiece and issued their laws in the form of senatorial decrees; by the 2nd century the emperor was openly replacing whatever other sources of written law had hitherto been permitted to function. After 100 the Assembly never met formally to pass a law, and the Senate often no longer bothered to couch its decrees in legal language, being content to repeat verbatim the speech with which the ruler had advocated the measure in question. After Hadrian, magistrates ceased modifying existing law by their legal interpretations because the praetors’ <e>edictum perpetuum</e> had become a permanent code, which the emperor alone could alter. By 200, learned jurists had lost the right they had enjoyed since the time of Augustus of giving authoritative rulings on disputed points (<e>responsa prudentium</e>). Meanwhile, the emperor more and more was legislating directly by means of edicts, judgments, mandates, and rescripts—collectively known as <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134375" tocid="">constitutiones principum</xref>
                </e>. He usually issued such <e>constitutiones</e> only after consulting the “friends” (<e>amici Caesaris</e>) who composed his imperial council. But a <e>constitutio</e> was nevertheless a fiat. The road to the later dominate (after 284) lay open.

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, the autocratic aspect of the Flavian and Antonine regimes should not be overstressed. Augustus himself had been well aware that it was impossible to disguise permanently the supremacy that accumulation of powers gained piecemeal conferred; his deportment in his last years differed little from that of Vespasian, Titus, and the so-called five good emperors who followed them. Nor had other Julio-Claudians hesitated to parade their predominance—Claudius, by centralizing the imperial powers, reduced their apparent diversity to one all-embracing <e>imperium</e>; Gaius and Nero revealed the autocracy implicit in the principate with frank brutality.
              </p>
              <p>What impresses perhaps as much as the undoubtedly autocratic behaviour of the Flavians and Antonines is the markedly civilian character of their reigns. They held supreme power, and some of them were distinguished soldiers; yet they were not military despots. For this the old republican tradition—whereby a state official might serve in both a civilian and a military capacity—was largely responsible. Matters, however, were open to change after Hadrian separated the two realms of service. Actually, the 3rd century soon showed what it meant to have a princeps whose whole experience had been confined to camps and barracks.</p>
              <p>As imperial powers became more concentrated, republican institutions decayed; the importance of imperial officials grew, while the authority of urban magistrates declined. Quaestorship, praetorship, and consulship (the last-named now reduced to a two-month sinecure) became mere stepping stones to the great imperial posts that counted most in the life of the empire. Governors of imperial provinces and commanders of legions were Roman senators; but they were equally imperial appointees. Clearly, the emperor was the master of the Senate; and it was disingenuous for him to get impatient, as some emperors did, with the Senate’s lack of initiative and reluctance to take firm decisions of its own. The emperor might not even consult the Senate much, preferring to rely on his imperial council, in which equestrian bureau chiefs over the course of the 2nd century came to constitute an established element.</p>
              <p>The Senate, however, at least until the reign of Commodus, was treated courteously by most Flavians and Antonines. They recognized its importance as a lawcourt, as the body that formally appointed a new emperor, and as a sounding board of informed opinion. Senators came increasingly from the provinces, and, although this meant preeminently the western provinces (the Greek-speaking East being underrepresented), the Senate did reflect to some extent the views of the empire at large.</p>
              <p>
                The equites, meanwhile, steadily acquired greater importance as imperial officials. In newly created posts they invariably became the incumbents, and in posts of long standing they replaced freedmen and <e>publicani</e>. During the 2nd century equestrian procurators increased markedly in numbers as the direction of imperial business came to be more tidily subdivided. Four grades of service distinguished by salary were established. While the government assumed a more rational flow and outline, its total number of employees nevertheless remained quite tiny, compared with that of the 4th and later centuries.

              <headtitle>Rome and Italy</headtitle>
              <p>
                By the 2nd century the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118952" tocid="">city</xref> of Rome had attracted freeborn migrants from all over the empire; it housed, additionally, large numbers of manumitted slaves. These newcomers were all assimilated and diluted the city’s Italian flavour. The vast majority of them were poor, the handful of opulent imperial freedmen being entirely exceptional. But many were energetic, enterprising, and lucky, able to make their way in the world. Freedmen laboured under a social stigma, although some of them managed to become equites. Their sons, however, might overcome discrimination, and their grandsons were even eligible for membership in the Senate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inevitably, there was extensive trade and commerce (much of it in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218490" tocid="">freedman</xref> hands) in so large a city, which was also the centre of imperial administration. There was little industry, however, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="619515" tocid="">urban</xref> poor had difficulty finding steady employment. Theirs was a precarious existence, dependent on the public grain dole and on the private charity of the wealthy. Large building programs gave Flavian and Antonine emperors the opportunity not only to repair the damage caused by fire and falling buildings (as stated, a frequent hazard among the densely packed and flimsily built accommodations for the urban plebs) but also to relieve widespread urban unemployment. They also made imperial Rome a city of grandeur. Augustus’ building program had been vast but mostly concerned with repairing or rebuilding structures already existing, and his Julio-Claudian successors had built relatively little until the great fire made room for the megalomaniac marvels of Nero’s last years. It was under the Flavians and Antonines that Rome obtained many of its most celebrated structures: the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="126613" tocid="">Colosseum</xref>, Palatine palaces, Trajan’s Forum, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441553" tocid="">Pantheon</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="98447" tocid="">Castel</xref> Sant’ Angelo (Hadrian’s mausoleum), the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, Aurelius’ Column, as well as the aqueducts whose arches spanned across Campagna to keep the city and its innumerable fountains supplied with water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Italy was much less cosmopolitan and sophisticated and, according to literary tradition, much more sober and straitlaced than was Rome. It was the mistress of the empire, although the gap between it and the provinces was narrowing. Hadrian’s policies especially helped to reduce its privileged position. His use of circuit judges was resented precisely because with them Italy resembled a province; actually, Italy badly needed them, and their abolition by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28784" tocid="">Antoninus Pius</xref> was soon reversed by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364331" tocid="">Marcus Aurelius</xref>. Also, in Aurelius’ reign a provincial fate overtook Italy in the form of barbarian invasion; a few years later the country got its first legionary garrison under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536763" tocid="">Septimius Severus</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The economic importance of Italy also declined. By the end of Augustus’ reign, the ascendancy of its wine, oil, marble, and fine pottery in the markets of Gaul and Germany had already begun to yield to the competition of local production in the West; and, by Flavian times, Italy was actually importing heavily not only from Gaul (witness the crates of yet-unpacked Gallic bowls and plates caught in the destruction of Pompeii) but also from Spain. The latter province was especially represented by its extraordinarily popular condiment, <e>garum</e>; its olive oil, too, was a sizable item on Italian tables after <e ty="s">ad</e> 100, only to yield its primacy there, by the mid-2nd century, to oil from northern Africa. By then, Spanish, Gallic, and African farm products all outweighed Italian ones in Ostia and Rome. Against such tendencies, the emperors did what they could: Domitian, for example, protected Italian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="631237" tocid="">viticulture</xref> by restricting vine growing in the provinces; Trajan and his successors forced Roman senators to take an interest in the country, even though it was no longer the homeland of many of them, by investing a high proportion of their capital in Italian land (one-third under Trajan, one-quarter under Aurelius).

              <p>
                The 18th-century historian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="233161" tocid="">Edward Gibbon’s</xref> famous description of the 2nd century as the period when men were happiest and most prosperous is not entirely false. Certainly, by then people had come to take for granted the unique greatness and invincibility of the empire; even the ominous events of Aurelius’ reign failed to shatter their conviction that the empire was impregnable; and the internal disturbances of the preceding reign had not given cause for much alarm. The credit for the empire’s success lay less with what its rulers did and could do than with what they did not do: they did not interfere too much. The empire was a vast congeries of peoples and races with differing religions, customs, and languages, and the emperors were content to let them live their own lives. Imperial policy favoured a veneer of common culture transcending ethnic differences, but there was no deliberate denationalization. Ambitious men striving for a career naturally found it helpful, if not necessary, to become Roman in bearing and conduct and perhaps even in language as well (although speakers of Greek often rose to exalted positions). But local self-government was the general rule, and neither Latin nor Roman ways were imposed on the communities composing the empire. The official attitude to religion illustrates this—in line with the absolutist trend, emperor worship was becoming slowly but progressively more theocratic (Domitian relished the title of god, Commodus demanded it); yet this did not lead to the suppression of non-Roman or even outlandish cults, unless they were thought immoral (like Druidism, with its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275881" tocid="">human sacrifice</xref>) or conducive to public disorder (like Christianity, with its uncompromising dismissal of all gods other than its own as mere demons, and wicked and hurtful ones at that—hence its liability to become a target for riots).

              <p>
                While there is no indication that the central authorities consciously opposed the increase of governmental personnel, the number of government employees certainly grew very slowly. Thus the responsibilities of the magnates in provincial cities were correspondingly great. In parts of southern Spain or in the area south of the Black Sea, for example, where the extent of the territories dependent on cities stretched out over many scores of miles into the surrounding landscape, city senators had not only to collect taxes but also to build roads and carry out much rural police work. Within their cities, too, senators had to see to the collection of taxes and tolls; as a group, they had to oversee and assign the income from municipal lands or buildings rented out and from endowments established by generous citizens; they had to authorize the plans and financing of sometimes very elaborate civic structures—an aqueduct, an <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="21610" tocid="">amphitheatre</xref>, or a temple to the imperial family—or of great annual festivals and fairs or of ongoing amenities serving the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55888" tocid="">public baths</xref> (free oil for anointing oneself, heating, and upkeep) or the public markets. In the eastern provinces, they had to replenish from time to time the stock of small local bronze coins; and they had to insure that magistracies were effectively staffed, even though there usually was no salary of any sort to attract candidates. Magistrates and city senators generally had to pay handsomely for their election and thereafter make further handsome contributions, as need arose and so far as they could afford, toward the adornment of their community.
              </p>
              <p>What attracted candidates in adequate numbers were most often three inducements: the feeling of community approval and praise, offered in the most public ways (described by writers of the time with striking psychological penetration); the enhancement of personal influence (meaning power) through the demonstration of great financial means; and finally, the social and political advancement that might follow on local prominence through attracting the attention of a governor or of the emperor himself. It was from the provincial elite that new Roman senators were made.</p>
              <p>
                Cities, through their elite families, competed with each other across entire regions. City rivalries in northern Italy or western Anatolia happen to be especially well reported. Within individual cities, elite families were often in competition as well. In consequence, the standards of municipal beneficence rose, encouraged by a populace who on public occasions assembled in large numbers in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590186" tocid="">theatre</xref>, demanding yet more expenditure from their leaders. The emperors, who realized that the well-being of cities, the jewels of their realm, depended on such munificence, increasingly intervened to insure a continued flow of good things from the rich of a community to their fellow citizens. Legislation might, for example, specify the binding nature of electoral campaign promises or of formerly voluntary contributions connected with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119404" tocid="">public service</xref>. As a consequence, in the 2nd century consideration must for the first time be given to the local aristocrat unwilling to serve his city; the series of imperial pronouncements exerting compulsion on such a person to serve was to stretch far into the future, with increasing severity. Attempts to stabilize the benefits arising from ambitious rivalries thus had an oppressive aspect.
              </p>
              <p>As to the lower orders, their voice is rarely heard in surviving sources, except in acclamation. So long as the rich voluntarily covered the bulk of local expenses and so long as they commanded the leisure and knowledge of the world to give to administration unsalaried, the poor could not fairly claim much of a right to determine the city’s choices. Thus they acclaimed the candidacies of the rich and their gifts and otherwise gave vent to their wishes only by shouting in unison in the theatre or amphitheatre (in between spectacles) or through violent mob actions.</p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the poor routinely solved the problems of daily life by appealing to someone of influence locally; this was true whether in Palestine, as indicated in the Talmud, or in Italy, as is evident from Pliny’s correspondence. The higher one looked in society, the more it appeared crisscrossed and interconnected by ties of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="318871" tocid="">kinship</xref> or of past services exchanged. It was at these higher levels that answers to routine problems were to be sought. Appeal was not directed to one’s peers, even though <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="601677" tocid="">trade associations</xref>, cult groups of social equals, and burial insurance clubs with monthly meetings could be found in every town. Such groups served <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="550940" tocid="">social</xref>, not political or economic, purposes, at least during the principate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accordingly, society was ordinarily described by contemporaries simply in terms of two classes, the upper and the lower, rich and poor, powerful and dependent, well known and nameless. The upper classes consisted of little more than 600 Roman senators, 25,000 equites, and 100,000 city senators; hence, a total amounting to 2 percent of the population. This stratum, from the mid-2nd century defined in law as “the more honourable,” <e>honestiores</e>, was minutely subdivided into degrees of dignity, the degrees being well advertised and jealously asserted; the entire stratum, however, was entitled to receive specially tender treatment in the courts. The remaining population was lumped together as “the more lowly,” <e>humiliores</e>, subject to torture when giving witness in court; to beatings, not fines; and to execution (in increasingly savage forms of death) rather than exile for the most serious crimes. Yet because of the existing patterns of power, which directed the <e>humiliores</e> to turn for help to the upper stratum, the lower classes did not form a revolutionary mass but constituted a stable element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pyramidal structure of society suggested by the statistics given above is somewhat obscured by the reality and prominence of the urban scene. In the cities the harsh outlines of the distribution of wealth were moderated by a certain degree of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551322" tocid="">social mobility</xref>. No class offers more success stories than that of freedmen. Especially in the West, freedmen are astonishingly prominent in the record of inscriptions and proverbial for what the upper classes called unprincipled enterprise and vulgar moneygrubbing. Artisans and tradespeople—lowly folk, in the eyes of someone like Cicero—in fact presented themselves with a certain dignity, even some financial ease. At the bottom, slaves were numerous, constituting perhaps one-tenth of the population in at least the larger towns outside of Italy and considerably more in Italy—as much as one-quarter in Rome. But in the cities many of them at least enjoyed security from starvation and had a good roof over their heads. When one turns to the rural scene, however, one encounters a far larger, harsher world. In the first place, nine-tenths of the empire’s people lived on the land and from its yield. Where details of their lives emerge with any clarity, they most often tell of a changeless and bleak existence. The city looked down on the countryside with elaborate scorn, keeping the rural population at arm’s length. Very often people in the country had their own language—such as Gallic, Syriac, Libyphoenician, or Coptic, which further isolated them—and their own religion, marriage customs, and forms of entertainment. In time, the very term “country dweller,” <e>paganus</e>, set the rural population still further apart from the empire’s Christianized urban population.

            <p>In the overall context of Western history, the degree to which the Mediterranean world during the period of the empire became one single system, one civilization, is a matter of the greatest importance. Clearly, one must distinguish between the life of the rural masses and that of the urban minority.

However, the device of organizing conquered territories under cities responsible for their surrounding territory proved as successful under the Romans as under the Greeks. The intent of both conquerors may have been limited to ensuring political control and the yield of tribute; however, in fact, they achieved much more: an approach to uniformity, at least in the cities.</p>

                </thumbasm>The first thing to strike the traveler’s eye, in any survey of the 2nd-century empire, would have been the physical appearance of urban centres; as already noted, whatever the province, many of the same architectural forms could be observed: the suburbs tended to have aqueducts and racetracks and the cities a central grand market area surrounded by porticoes, temples, a records office, a council hall, a basilica for judicial hearings and public auctions, and a covered market hall of a characteristic shape for perishable foods (a macellum, as in Pompeii, in Perge on the southern coast of modern Turkey, or in North African Lepcis); there also would have been public baths with several separate halls for cold or hot bathing or exercise, a covered or open-air theatre, grand fountains, monumental arches, and honorific statues of local worthies by the dozens or even hundreds. Eastern centres would have gymnasia, occasionally Western ones as well; and Western cities would have amphitheatres, occasionally Eastern ones as well, for the imported institution of gladiatorial combats. Throughout the Western provinces, public buildings were likely to be arranged according to a single plan—more or less the same everywhere—in which a grid of right-angle streets was dominant, at least toward the central part of the city.

                </thumbasm>In the West, as opposed to the East, a great deal of urbanization remained to be done and was accomplished by the Romans. The grid plan, its particular mark, can be detected at the heart of places such as Turin, Banasa (Morocco), and Autun, all Augustan foundations, as well as in Nicopolis (Bulgaria), Budapest, and Silchester, all later ones. As noted above, orthogonal <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="619445" tocid="">town planning</xref> was not a Roman invention, but the Romans introduced it to new regions and with a particular regularity of their own. Moreover, the grid of the central part of the city was matched, and sometimes extended on the same lines, by another grid laid across the surrounding territory. The process, referred to as centuriation, typically made use of squares of 2,330 feet (710 metres) on a side, intended for land distribution to settlers and general purposes of inventory. Signs of it were first detected in northern Africa in the 1830s, through surviving crop marks and roads, and have since (especially through air photography) been traced in the environs of Trier and Homs (Syria) and large areas of northern Italy, Tunisia, and elsewhere. In the placing of cities and roads and property boundaries, the Romans of the empire therefore left a nearly indelible stamp of their organizing energies on the map of Europe; they also established the lives of conquered populations inside their own characteristic framework.

                The special burst of energy in the Augustan colonizing spread abroad not only the visible elements of a ruling civilization but the invisible ones as well. Colonies and municipalities received Roman forms of government according to their charters, they were administered by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref> in Latin, and they diffused these things throughout the general population within and around them. In frontier areas such lessons in an alien civilization were pressed home by garrison forces through their frequent contacts with their hosts and suppliers. By the 2nd century considerable Latinization had occurred in the West. Modern Spanish, Portuguese, and French show that this was particularly true of the Iberian peninsula, which had been provincial soil ever since the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483518" tocid="">Second Punic War</xref>, and of Gaul, where Latin enjoyed the advantage of some relationship to Celtic. In these regions, except in the less accessible rural or mountainous parts, even the lower orders adopted Latin. Today one can find in Romania the tongue that is the closest to its parent, Latin, even at so great a distance from its home. And Latin can be found not only in Romance languages; it has left its mark on languages such as Basque and German.

              <p>
                Inscriptions represent the most frequent testimony to linguistic allegiance; more than a quarter of a million survive in Latin from the period of the empire, the vast majority of them being <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154596" tocid="">funerary</xref>. The number of inscriptions per year increases slowly during the 1st century and a half <e ty="s">ad</e>, thereafter ascending in a steep line to a point in the second decade of the 3rd and then falling off even more steeply. The curve is best explained as reflecting pride in “Romanness”—in possessing not only Latin but full citizenship as well and, thereby, admission to a group for whom commemoration of the deceased was a legal as well as a moral duty. Over the course of time, by individual gift from the emperors, by army service, and by election to magistracies or simply to the city senates of colonies and municipalities, a growing proportion of the empire’s population had gained citizenship; moreover, their children were citizens, whose descendants in turn were Romans in the legal sense. By <e ty="s">ad</e> 212 this accelerating process had advanced so far that the emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="94451" tocid="">Caracalla</xref> could offer the gift of incorporation to the entirety of his subjects without much notice being taken of his generosity—it was already in the possession of most of the people who counted and whose reactions might be recorded. Once citizenship was universal, it ceased to constitute a distinction; thus the declaration of it through the custom of funerary commemoration rapidly passed out of favour.

              <p>
                One great flaw in the picture of the empire as one single civilization by 212, triumphantly unified in culture as in its political form, has already been pointed out: what was achieved within the cities’ walls did not extend with any completeness to the rural population, among whom local ways and native languages persisted. Peasants in 4th-century Syria spoke mostly Syriac, in Egypt mostly Coptic, in Africa often Punic or Libyphoenician, and in the Danube and northwestern provinces other native tongues. There was still another great flaw: the empire was half Roman (or Latin), half <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244595" tocid="">Greek</xref>. The latter was hardly touched by the former except through what may be called official channels—that is, law, coinage, military presence, imperial cult, and the superposition of an alien structure of power and prestige, to which the elite of the Eastern provinces might aspire. On the other hand, the Roman half was steeped in Greek ways. Apuleius, for example, though born and reared in a small North African town of the 2nd century, was sent to Athens to study rhetoric; on his return he could find not only an audience for his presentations in Greek but ordinary people in the marketplace able to read a letter in that language. In Rome the Christian community used Greek as its liturgical language well into the 3rd century, and the crowds in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118506" tocid="">Circus Maximus</xref> could enjoy a pun in Greek; an aristocrat such as the emperor Marcus Aurelius could be expected to be as bilingual as was Cicero or Caesar before him or even, like the emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="224416" tocid="">Gallienus</xref>, help the Greek philosopher Plotinus found a sort of Institute for Advanced Studies in the Naples area. Greece continued to supply a great deal of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="530179" tocid="">sculpture</xref> for Western buyers or even the teams of artisans needed for the decoration of public buildings in 3rd-century northern Africa. By such various means the division between the two halves of the empire was for a time covered over.

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                Among the institutions most important in softening the edges of regional differences was the cult of the emperors. In one sense, it originated in the 4th century <e ty="s">bc</e>, when <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14224" tocid="">Alexander the Great</xref> first received veneration by titles and symbols and forms of address as if he were a superhuman being. Indeed, he must have seemed exactly that to contemporaries in Egypt, where the pharaohs had long been worshiped, and to peoples in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="381192" tocid="">Middle East</xref>, for similar reasons of religious custom. Even the Greeks were quite used to the idea that beings who lived a human life of extraordinary accomplishment, as “heroes” in the full sense of the Greek word, would never die but be raised into some higher world; they believed this of heroes such as Achilles, Hercules, Pythagoras, and Dion of Syracuse in the mid-4th century <e ty="s">bc</e>. Great Roman commanders, like Hellenistic rulers, had altars, festivals, and special honours voted to them by Greek cities from the start of the 2nd century <e ty="s">bc</e>. It was not so strange, then, that a freedman supporter of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88114" tocid="">Caesar’s</xref> erected a pillar over the ashes of the dead dictator in the Forum in April 44 <e ty="s">bc</e> and offered cult to him as a being now resident among the gods. Many citizens joined in. Within days Caesar’s heir Octavian pressed for the declaration of Caesar as divine—which the Senate granted by its vote in 42. By 25 <e ty="s">bc</e> the city of Mytilene had organized annual cult acts honouring <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43047" tocid="">Augustus</xref> and communicated their forms and impulse to Tarraco in Spain as well as to other Eastern Greek cities; and by 12 <e ty="s">bc</e> divine honours to Caesar and Augustus’ <e>genius</e> were established through the emperors’ initiative both in the Gallic capital, Lugdunum, and in the neighbourhood chapels to the crossroads gods in Rome. From these various points and models, emperor worship spread rapidly. Within a few generations, cities everywhere had built in its service new temples that dominated their forums or had assigned old temples to the joint service of a prior god and the imperial family. Such centres served as rallying points for the citizenry to express its devotion to Rome and the emperor. To speak for whole provinces, priests of the cult assembled during their year of office in central shrines, such as Lugdunum, as delegates of their cities, where they formulated for the emperor their complaints or their views on the incumbent governor’s administration. Whether these priests were freedmen in urban neighbourhoods, municipal magnates in local temples, or still grander leaders of the provinces, they perceived the imperial cult as something of high prestige and invested it and Roman rule with glory.

              <p>
                The emotional and political unification of the empire was further promoted by submissive or flattering forms of reference or address, adopted even by the highest personages when speaking of the emperor, and by portraits of the emperors or their families with attendant written messages. Of these two most obvious means of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="478875" tocid="">propaganda</xref>, the first survives in the texts of many <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441150" tocid="">panegyrics</xref> delivered to the throne, rhetorical disquisitions on monarchy, and prefatory announcements accompanying the publication of government edicts. They established a tone in which it was proper to think of Roman rule and government. Portraits, the second means of propaganda, included painted ones on general display in cities, sculpted ones, especially in the early years of each reign, based on official models available in a few major cities (hundreds of these survive, including at least one in gold), and engraved ones on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="124716" tocid="">coins</xref>. Imperial coins offered a more rapidly changing exhibition of images than even postage stamps in the modern world. Because the dies soon wore out, many scores of issues had to be brought out each year, in gold, silver, and bronze. While the images (“types”) and words (“legends”) on them tended to repetition, there was much conscious inculcation of topical messages: for example, in the short and rocky reign of Galba in <e ty="s">ad</e> 69, one finds the legends “All’s well that ends well” (<e>bonus eventus</e>), “Rome reborn,” “Peace for Romans,” and “Constitutional government restored” (<e>libertas restituta</e>, with iconographic reference to Brutus’ coins of 43 <e ty="s">bc</e>) and superlative portraits of Galba himself; or, in other reigns, the legends, enriched with suitable symbolism, read “the soldiers loyal,” “Italy well fed,” and <e>fecunditas</e> of the royal family and its progeny. So far as it is possible to comprehend the mind of the empire’s populace, there was no significant opposition to the government by the 2nd century; instead, there prevailed a great deal of ready veneration for the principate as an institution.

              <p>
                Economic factors, to the extent that they were favourable, played an obvious part in promoting both cultural and political unity. So far as acculturation was concerned, a limit to its achievement was clearly set by the amount of disposable capital among non-Romanized populations. The cost of such luxuries as schooling in Latin or frescoes on one’s walls were high. But more and more people could afford them as the benefits of Roman occupation were spreading. The rising levels of prosperity did not, however, result from a special benevolence on the part of the conquerors, intent as they were (and often cruelly intent) on the pleasures and profits of physical mastery over the conquered. Rather, they can be explained, first, by the imposition of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447447" tocid="">Pax Romana</xref>, which gave urban centres surer access to the surrounding rural areas and rural producers access in turn to convenient, centralized markets; second, by the sheer attractiveness of imported articles, which intensified efforts to increase the power to buy them; third, by the economic stimulation afforded by taxes, which had to be paid on new earnings but which remained in the provinces where they were raised. In the fourth place, prosperity also rose in the regions least Romanized. This can be explained by the fact that they tended to be heavily garrisoned and the soldiers spent their wages locally. So far as they could, they bought goods and services of a Roman sort and generally attracted concentrations of people likely to develop into cities of a Roman sort. The economic impact of army payrolls was all the greater because of the cash added to them from taxes raised in other, more developed provinces in the East. Much of the urbanization and enrichment of the western and northern provinces can be explained by these four factors.

                Until the 1950s or ’60s the sources for studying the economy of the empire were insufficient. The archaeological sources were too scarce and heterogeneous to be of much help, and the written ones contained barely usable amounts of quantified data; economic analysis without quantification, however, is almost a contradiction in terms. Thus discussion was obliged to limit itself to rather general remarks about the obviously wide exchange of goods, the most famous points of production or sale of given articles, techniques of banking, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="86266" tocid="">commercial law</xref>. This is still the case with regard to the Eastern half of the Mediterranean world, where excavation has made relatively little headway; but, for the West, archaeological data have greatly increased in recent decades in both quantity and intelligibility. As a result, a growing number of significant statements based on quantification can now be made. They are of special value because they bear on what was economically most important—namely, agriculture. Like any preindustrial economy, that of the empire derived the overwhelming bulk of its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="246663" tocid="">gross national product</xref> from food production. One would therefore like to know what regions in what periods produced what rough percentage of the chief comestibles—wine, oil, wheat, <e>garum</e> or legumes. Thanks to techniques such as neutron activation analysis or X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, the contents of large samples of amphorae at certain market junctures can be identified, dated by shape of vessel, and occasionally ascribed to certain named producers of the vessel, and the information drawn into a graph; or, the numbers and find-spots of datable fine “china” (so-called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="588160" tocid="">Arretine ware</xref> or later equivalents) or ceramic oil lamps from named producers can be indicated on a map of, say, Spain or France. The yield of such data underlies statements made above regarding, for example, the supersession of Italy as producer of several essential agricultural products by the mid-1st century <e ty="s">ad</e>, the concurrent transformation of Gaul from importer to exporter, and the emergence by the 3rd century of northern Africa as a major exporter of certain very common articles. Information of this general nature provides some sense of the shift in prosperity in the Western provinces.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the age of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28759" tocid="">Antonines</xref>, Rome’s empire enjoyed an obvious and prosperous tranquility; modern consensus has even settled on about <e ty="s">ad</e> 160 as the peak of Roman civilization. Whatever measurement may be used in this identification, however, an economic one does not fit very well. Evidence, as it accumulates in more quantifiable form, does not seem to show any perceptible economic decline in the empire as a whole after roughly 160. Rather, Italy had probably suffered some decrease in disposable wealth in the earlier 1st century. Gaul’s greatest city, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352917" tocid="">Lugdunum</xref>, had begun to shrink toward the end of the 2nd, and various other regions in the West suffered setbacks at various times, while all of Greece continued to be poor. Other regions, however, had more wealth to spend, and as is manifest in major urban projects of utility and beautification or in the larger rooms and increasingly expensive decoration of rural villas. Roman rule also brought extraordinary benefits to the economies of Numidia and Britain, to name its two most obvious successes.
              </p>
              <p>
                To the extent the empire grew richer, modern observers are likely to look for an explanation in technology. As noted above, in Augustus’ reign a new mode of glassblowing spread rapidly from Syria to other production centres; Syria in the 3rd century was also the home of new and more complicated weave patterns. Such rather minor items, however, only show that technical improvements in industry were few and insignificant. The screw press for wine and olive oil was more efficient than the levered variety, but it was not widely adopted, even within Italy. Waterwheels for power, known in Anatolia in Augustus’ reign, were little used; a few examples in Gaul belong only to the later empire. Similarly, the mechanical reaper was found only in Gaul of the 4th century. Perhaps the most significant advances were registered in the selective breeding of strains of grains and domestic animals: for example, the “Roman” <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="539405" tocid="">sheep</xref> (which had originated in the Greek East) spread throughout Europe, banishing the inferior <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="294368" tocid="">Iron Age</xref> species to a merited exile in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="435568" tocid="">Outer Hebrides</xref> (the Soay sheep of St. Kilda island). What is vastly more significant, however, than these oddments of technological history is the minute subdivision of productive skills and their transmission from father to son in populations adequate to the demand—for iron ore from Noricum, most notably, or for glass and paper from Alexandria. Specialization in inherited skills produced a remarkably high level of proficiency, requiring only the security of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447447" tocid="">Pax Romana</xref> for the spreading of its products everywhere—transport itself being one of those skills.
              </p>
              <p>The health of the economy no doubt helps to explain the political success of the empire, which was not disturbed by frequent revolts or endemic rural or urban unrest. On the other hand, there were limits in the economy, which expressed themselves through resistance to taxation. Tax levels settled at the enforceable maximum; but revenue fell far short of what one might expect, given the best estimates of the empire’s gross national product. The basic problem was the tiny size of the imperial government and the resulting inefficiency of its processes. Moreover, it could not make good its inadequacies by borrowing in times of special need; Nero’s need to harry his millionaire subjects with false charges of treason in order to pay for his incredibly expensive court and spendthrift impulses reflects the realities of raising revenue. So do the very cautious experiments of Augustus in setting army pay and army size. Ultimately, the military strength of the empire was insufficient—inadequate for emergencies—because of these realities.</p>

              <headtitle>The army</headtitle>
              <p>
                The army that enforced the Pax Romana had expanded little beyond the size envisaged for it by Augustus, despite the enlargement of the empire by Claudius, the Flavians, and Trajan. It reached 31 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="335026" tocid="">legions</xref> momentarily under Trajan, but it usually numbered 28 under the Flavians and Antonines until the onset of the frontier crisis in Aurelius’ reign brought it to 30. Without raising pay rates to attract recruits more easily, a large force was seemingly beyond reach—which probably explains why Hadrian, and later Commodus, halted further expansion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The army was used not to prop up a militarist government but to defend the frontiers. Shifts in enemy pressures, however, caused the legions to be distributed differently than in Julio-Claudian times. Under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28784" tocid="">Antoninus Pius</xref>, the Danubian provinces (Pannonia, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="387476" tocid="">Moesia</xref>, Dacia) had 10, and the East (Anatolia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt) had 9, and both regions also had supporting naval flotillas; of the remaining 9 legions, Britain contained 3 and the Rhineland 4. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579997" tocid="">Tacitus</xref> in his <e>Annals</e> (4.5) rates the auxiliary troops near the turn of the era as being about as numerous as the legionaries. But they soon outnumbered them: that is, whereas legions contained somewhat more than 5,000 men each if they were at full strength and thus totaled roughly 150,000 in the mid-2nd century, the auxiliaries numbered 245,000—again, if at full strength. Recent estimates put the actual figure for the entire army at 375,000 to 400,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two reasons, military and financial, explain the growing use of nonlegionaries. Mustered in units mostly of 500, they were easier to move around and could be encouraged to maintain the special native skills of their inheritance—as slingers from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="50115" tocid="">Balearic Islands</xref> or Crete, in camel corps from Numidia, or as light cavalry from Thrace. In addition, they could be recruited for lower wages than legionaries. As regards recruitment for the legions, even that higher rate proved less and less attractive. Whereas legions in the early empire could be largely filled with men born in Italy and southern Gaul, by the second half of the 1st century most of the men had to be drawn from the provinces; after Trajan, they were largely natives of the frontier provinces. Young men from the inner parts of the empire, growing up in successive generations of continual peace, no longer looked on military service as a natural part of manhood, and the civilian economy appeared attractive compared to the rewards at some frontier posting. Peace and prosperity thus combined to make the army less and less Roman, less and less of the centre, and more and more nearly barbarous.
              </p>
              <p>
                The troops’ loyalty did not suffer on that account. The men were no more ready to mutiny or to support a pretender around <e ty="s">ad</e> 200 than they had been in the early empire. However, experience especially in the year of the four emperors (<e ty="s">ad</e> 69) did suggest the desirability of splitting commands into smaller units, which, in turn, involved splitting up provinces, the number of which was constantly growing; by Hadrian’s day subdivision began to anticipate the fragmentation later carried out by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="164042" tocid="">Diocletian</xref>.

              <headtitle>Cultural life</headtitle>
              <p>
                The literature of the empire is both abundant and competent, for which the emperors’ encouragement and financing of libraries and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="265464" tocid="">higher education</xref> were perhaps in part responsible. The writers, however, with the possible exception of Christian apologists, were seldom excitingly original and creative. As <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579997" tocid="">Tacitus</xref> said, the great masters of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="343579" tocid="">literature</xref> had ceased to be. Perhaps Augustus’ emphasis on tradition affected more than political ideals and practice. At any rate, men of letters, too, looked often backward. At the same time, they clearly reveal the success of the empire in spreading Greco-Roman culture, for the majority of them were natives of neither Italy nor Greece. Of the writers in Latin, the two Senecas, Lucan, Martial, Columella, Hyginus, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="373603" tocid="">Pomponius Mela</xref> came from Spain; Fronto, Apuleius, and probably Florus and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="227997" tocid="">Aulus Gellius</xref>, from Africa. Tacitus was perhaps from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="403437" tocid="">Gallia Narbonensis</xref>. The Latin writers in general sought their models less in Greece than in Augustus’ Golden Age, when <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331905" tocid="">Latin literature</xref> had reached maturity. Thus, the poets admired <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629832" tocid="">Virgil</xref> and imitated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="436057" tocid="">Ovid</xref>; lacking genuine inspiration, they substituted for it an erudite cleverness, the fruit of an education that stressed oratory of a striking but sterile kind. Authentic eloquence in Latin came to an end when, as Tacitus put it, the principate “pacified” oratory. Under the Flavians and Antonines, an artificial rhetoric, constantly straining after meretricious effects, replaced it. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189941" tocid="">epigrammatic</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="29553" tocid="">aphorism</xref> (<e>sententia</e>) was especially cultivated; the epics of Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="544446" tocid="">Silius Italicus</xref>, and Statius are full of it, and it found a natural outlet in satirical writing, of which the Latin instinct for the mordant always ensured an abundance. In fact, Latin satire excelled: witness Martial’s epigrams, Petronius’ and Juvenal’s pictures of the period, and Persius’ more academic talent. For that matter, Tacitus’ irony and pessimism were not far removed from satire.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the East the official status of Greek and the favour it enjoyed from such emperors as Hadrian gave new life to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244649" tocid="">Greek literature</xref>. It had something in common with its Latin counterpart in that it looked to the past but was chiefly written by authors who were not native to the birthplace of the language. The so-called Second Sophistic reverted to the atticism of an earlier day but often in a Roman spirit; its products from the Asian pens of Dio Chrysostom and Aelius Aristides are sometimes limpid and talented tours de force but rarely great literature. In Greek, too, the best work was in satire, the comic prose dialogues of the Syrian Lucian being the most noteworthy and original literary creations of the period. Among minor writers the charm of Arrian and Pausanias, Asians both, and above all of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="465201" tocid="">Plutarch</xref> abides (although Plutarch’s talents were mediocre, and his moralizing was shallow, his biographies, like those of his Latin contemporary <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="571641" tocid="">Suetonius</xref>, are full of information and interest).
              </p>
              <p>Imperial encouragement of Greek culture and a conviction, no longer justified, of its artistic and intellectual superiority caused the East to resist Latinization. This attitude was bound to lead to a divided empire, and thoughtful observers must have noted it with misgivings. The split, however, was still far in the future. Meanwhile, there was a more immediate cause for disquiet. The plethora of summaries and anthologies that appeared implies a public progressively indifferent to reading whole works of literature for themselves. In other words, the outlook for letters was poor, and this had an unfortunate effect on the scientific literature of the age, which was in itself of first-class quality. Dioscorides on botany, Galen on medicine, and Ptolemy on mathematics, astronomy, and geography represent expert scholars expounding carefully, systematically, and lucidly the existing knowledge in their respective fields. But their very excellence proved fatal because, as the reading public dwindled, theirs remained standard works for far too long; their inevitable errors became enshrined, and their works acted as brakes on further progress.</p>
              <p>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="566892" tocid="">Stoicism</xref> was the most flourishing philosophy of the age. In the East a sterile scholasticism diligently studied Plato and Aristotle, but <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189728" tocid="">Epictetus</xref>, the stoic from Anatolia, was the preeminent philosopher. In the West, stoicism permeates Seneca’s work and much of Pliny’s <e>Natural History</e>. Evidently, its advocacy of common morality appealed to the traditional Roman sense of decorum and duty, and its doctrine of a world directed by an all-embracing providence struck a responsive chord in the 2nd-century emperors, though they deeply disapproved of its extremist offshoots, the cynics: Marcus Aurelius, as noted, was himself a stoic.

                </thumbasm>Imperial art, dealing above all with man and his achievements, excelled in portraits and commemoration of events; Roman sculpture and presumably Roman painting, also, owed much to Greek styles and techniques. It emerged, however, as its own distinctive type. The Augustan age had pointed the way that Roman art would go: Italian taste would be imposed on Hellenic models to produce something original. The reliefs of the Augustan <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31340" tocid="">Ara Pacis</xref> belong to Rome and Italy, no matter who actually carved them. By Flavian times this Roman artistic instinct had asserted itself and with it the old Roman tendency toward lively and accurate pictorial representation. It can be seen from the reliefs illustrating the triumph over Judaea in the passageway of the Arch of Titus in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507743" tocid="">Roman Forum</xref>. The narrative description dear to Roman art found its best expression in the great spiral frieze on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="602191" tocid="">Trajan’s Column</xref>, where the emperor can be seen among his soldiers at various times in the Dacian campaigns; the story of the war plays a most important part, although, like most imperial monuments, the column is meant to exalt the leader. Under Hadrian a reaction made sculpture less markedly Italian, as if to be in conformity with the slow decline of Italy toward quasi-provincial status. Also under Hadrian, the figure of the emperor was more prominent—bigger and more frontal than the other figures—as if to illustrate the growing monarchical tone of the principate. This tendency continued under the Antonines, when there was a magnificent flowering of sculpture on panels, columns, and sarcophagi; but its exuberance and splendour foreshadow the end of classical art.
              </p>
              <p>
                The artistic currents that flowed in Rome were felt throughout the empire, the less developed areas being influenced most. In the West, provincial sculpture closely resembled Roman, although it sometimes showed variations, in Gaul especially, owing to local influences (the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="405982" tocid="">native element</xref>, however, is not always easy to identify). The Roman quality of portraits painted on Egyptian mummy cases shows that the Greek-speaking regions were also affected, although generally they maintained their own traditions. But by now the Greek East had become rather barren; much of its production was imitative rather than vitally creative. Greece proper contributed little, the centre of Hellenism having shifted to Anatolia, to places such as Aphrodisias, where there was a flourishing school of sculpture.
              </p>
              <p>
                In at least one respect the East was heavily influenced by Rome. The use of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131278" tocid="">concrete</xref> and cross vault enabled Roman <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32876" tocid="">architects</xref> and engineers to span wide areas; their technological achievements included the covered vastness of the huge thermal establishments, the massive solidity of the amphitheatres, and the audacity of the soaring bridges and aqueducts. The East was greatly impressed. Admittedly, the agoras and gymnasiums in Greek towns are hardly Roman in aspect, but, for most structures of a practical utilitarian kind, the Greek debt to Rome was heavy. Sometimes Roman influence can be seen not only in the fundamental engineering of such buildings as market gateways, theatres, and amphitheatres but even in such decorative details as composite capitals as well. Roman features abound in exotic Petra, Palmyra, Gerasa, and Baalbek, and even in Athens itself.

              <p>
                After the assassination of Commodus on Dec. 31, <e ty="s">ad</e> 192, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="453116" tocid="">Helvius Pertinax</xref>, the prefect of the city, became emperor. In spite of his modest birth, he was well respected by the Senate, but he was without his own army. He was killed by the praetorians at the end of March 193, after a three-month reign. The praetorians, after much corrupt bargaining, designated as emperor an old general, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="162476" tocid="">Didius Julianus</xref>, who had promised them the largest <e>donativum</e> (a donation given to each soldier on the emperor’s accession). The action of the praetorians roused the ire of the provincial armies. The army of the Danube, which was the most powerful as well as the closest to Rome, appointed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536763" tocid="">Septimius Severus</xref> in May 193. Severus soon had to face two competitors, supported, like himself, by their own troops: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="414784" tocid="">Pescennius Niger</xref>, the legate of Syria, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="13012" tocid="">Clodius Albinus</xref>, legate of Britain. After having temporarily neutralized Albinus by accepting him as Caesar (heir apparent), Septimius marched against Niger, whose troops, having come from Egypt and Syria, were already occupying Byzantium. The Danubian legions were victorious, and Niger was killed at the end of 194; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28297" tocid="">Antioch</xref> and Byzantium were pillaged after a long siege. Septimius even invaded Mesopotamia, for the Parthians had supported Niger. But this campaign was quickly interrupted: in the West, Albinus, disappointed at not being associated with the empire, proclaimed himself Augustus in 196 and invaded Gaul. He was supported by the troops, by the population, and even by the senators in Rome. In February 197 he was defeated and killed in a difficult battle near his capital of Lugdunum, which, in turn, was almost devastated. Septimius Severus remained the sole master of the empire, but the pillagings, executions, and confiscations left a painful memory. A few months later, in the summer of 197, he launched a second Mesopotamian campaign, this time against the Parthian king <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="632373" tocid="">Vologases IV</xref>, who had attacked the frontier outpost Nisibis conquered two years previously by the Romans. Septimius Severus was again victorious. Having arrived at the Parthian capitals (Seleucia and Ctesiphon), he was defeated near Hatra but in 198 obtained an advantageous peace: Rome retained a part of Mesopotamia, together with Nisibis, the new province being governed by an eques. After having inspected the East, the emperor returned to Rome in 202. He spent most of his time there until 208, when the incursions of Caledonian rebels called him to Britain, where he carried out a three-year campaign along <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="251254" tocid="">Hadrian’s Wall</xref>. He died at Eboracum (York) in February 211.
              </p>
              <p>
                Septimius Severus belonged to a Romanized Tripolitan family that had only recently attained honours. He was born in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336898" tocid="">Leptis Magna</xref> in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418538" tocid="">North Africa</xref> and favoured his native land throughout his reign. He was married to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307761" tocid="">Julia Domna</xref> of Emesa, a Syrian woman from an important priestly family, and was surrounded by Easterners. He had pursued a senatorial career and had proved himself a competent general, but he was above all a good administrator and a jurist. Disliking Romans, Italians, and senators, he deliberately relied on the faithful Danubian army that had brought him to power, and he always showed great concern for the provincials and the lower classes. Although he had sought to appropriate the popularity of the Antonines to his own advantage by proclaiming himself the son of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364331" tocid="">Marcus Aurelius</xref> and by naming his own son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, he in fact carried out a totally different policy—a brutal yet realistic policy that opened careers to new social classes. Indifferent to the prestige of the Senate, where he had a great many enemies, he favoured the equites. The army thus became the seedbed of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="190709" tocid="">equestrian</xref> order and was the object of all of his attentions. The ready forces were increased by the creation of three new legions commanded by equites, and one of these, the Second Parthica, was installed near Rome. Unlike Vespasian, who also owed his power to the army but who knew how to keep it in its proper place, Septimius Severus, aware of the urgency of external problems, established a sort of military monarchy. The praetorian cohorts doubled their ranks, and the dismissal of the old staff of Italian origin transformed the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473662" tocid="">Praetorian Guard</xref> into an imperial guard, in which the elite of the Danube army were the most important element. The auxiliary troops were increased by the creation of 1,000-man units (infantry cohorts) and cavalry troops, sometimes outfitted with mail armour in the Parthian manner. The careers of noncommissioned officers emerging from the ranks now opened onto new horizons: centurions and noncommissioned grades could attain the tribunate and enter into the equestrian order. Thus, a simple Illyrian peasant might attain high posts: this was undoubtedly the most significant aspect of the “Severan revolution.” This “democratization” was not necessarily a barbarization, for the provincial legions had long been Romanized. Their salaries were increased, and <e>donativa</e> were distributed more frequently; thenceforth, soldiers were fed at the expense of the provincials. Veterans received lands, mostly in Syria and Africa. The right of legitimate marriage, previously refused by Augustus, was granted to almost all of the soldiers, and the right to form <e>collegia</e> (private associations) was given to noncommissioned officers. Because more than a century had passed since the last raise in pay for the troops, despite a steady (if slow) rise in the level of prices, Severus increased the legionary’s base rate from 300 to 500 <e>denarii</e>, with, no doubt, corresponding increases in other ranks. The reflection of this step in the content of precious metal in silver coinage recalls a point made earlier: the imperial revenues were constrained within the narrow limits of political and administrative reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The administrative accomplishments of Septimius Severus were of great importance: he clearly outlined the powers of the city prefect; he entrusted the praetorian prefecture to first-class jurists, such as Papinian; and he increased the number of procurators, who were recruited for financial posts from among Africans and Easterners and for government posts (<e>praesides</e>) from among Danubian officers. Italy lost its privileges and found itself subjected, like all the other provinces, to the new <e>annona</e>, a tax paid in kind, which assured the maintenance of the army and of the officials. The consequent increase in expenditures—for administration, for the salaries and the <e>donativa</e> of the soldiers, for the maintenance of the Roman plebs, and for construction—obliged the emperor to devalue the denarius in 194. But the confiscations increased his personal fortune, the <e>res privata</e>, which had been previously created by Antoninus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Severus’ social policy favoured both the provincial recruitment of senators (Easterners, Africans, and even Egyptians), causing a sharp decrease in the percentage of Italian senators, and the elevation of the equestrian order, which began to fill the prince’s council with its jurists. The cities, which had been favoured by the Antonines, were more and more considered as administrative wheels in the service of the state: the richest <e>decuriones</e> (municipal councillors) were financially responsible for levying the taxes, and it was for this purpose that the towns of Egypt finally received a <e>boulē</e> (municipal senate).
              </p>
              <p>
                The burden of taxes and forced government service was made weightier by numerous transport duties for the army and for the <e>annona</e> service and was regulated by the jurists through financial, personal, or mixed charges. The state was watchful to keep the <e>decuriones</e> in the service of their cities and to provide a control on their administration through the appointment of <e>curatores rei publicae</e>, or officials of the central government. The lower classes were, in principle, protected against the abuses of the rich, but in fact they were placed at the service of the state through the restrictions imposed on shipping and commercial corporations. Membership might entail forced contributions of capital or labour to such public necessities as the supply of food to Rome. The state became more and more a policeman, and the excesses of power of numerous grain merchants (<e>frumentarii</e>) weighed heavily on the little man.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imperial power, without repudiating the ideological themes of the principate, rested in fact on the army and sought its legitimacy in heredity: the two sons of Septimius Severus, Caracalla and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="232168" tocid="">Geta</xref>, were first proclaimed Caesars, the former in 196, the latter in 198; later, they were directly associated with imperial power through bestowal of the title of Augustus, in 198 and 209, respectively. Thus, during the last three years of Septimius Severus’ reign, the empire had three Augusti at its head.

                </thumbasm>Caracalla, the eldest son of Septimius Severus, reigned from 211 to 217, after having assassinated his younger brother, Geta. He was a caricature of his father: violent, megalomaniacal, full of complexes, and, in addition, cruel and debauched. He retained the entourage of the equites and jurists who had governed with his father but enforced to an even greater degree his father’s militaristic and egalitarian policy. He increased the wages of the army even further and, at the same time, began a costly building program that quickly depleted the fortune left him by his father. He forced the senators to pay heavy contributions, doubled the inheritance and emancipation taxes, and often required the <e>aurum coronarium</e> (a contribution in gold), thereby ruining the urban middle classes. To counter the effects of a general upward drift of prices and the larger and better-paid army of his own and his father’s making, he created a new silver <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="124716" tocid="">coin</xref>, the antoninianus. It was intended to replace the basic denarius at double its value, though containing only about one and a half times its worth in precious metal. The only historical source to suggest Caracalla’s motive for his gift of universal citizenship, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="164018" tocid="">Dio Cassius</xref>, states that it was meant to increase revenues by bringing new elements of the population under tax obligations formerly limited to Romans only.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although little endowed with military qualities, Caracalla adopted as his patron <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14224" tocid="">Alexander the Great</xref>, whom he admired greatly, and embarked on an active external policy. He fought successfully against the Teutonic tribes of the upper Danube, among whom the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="13769" tocid="">Alamanni</xref>, as well as the Capri of the middle Danube, appeared for the first time; he often prudently mixed military operations with negotiation and gave important subsidies and money (in sound currency) to the barbarians, thus arousing much discontent. His ambition was to triumph in the East like his hero of old and, more recently, Trajan and his own father. He invaded Armenia and Adiabene and annexed Osroëne in northwest Mesopotamia, joining it to the part of Mesopotamia taken by Septimius Severus. In April 217, while pursuing his march on the Tigris, he was assassinated on the order of one of his praetorian prefects, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="355339" tocid="">Marcus Opellius Macrinus</xref>.

              <p>
                Macrinus was accepted as emperor by the soldiers, who were unaware of the role he had played in the death of his predecessor. For the first time an eques had acceded to the empire after having been no more than a manager of financial affairs. The senators reluctantly accepted this member of the equestrian order, who, nevertheless, proved to be moderate and conciliatory; but the armies despised him as a mere civilian, and the ancient authors were hostile to him. His reign was brief, and little is known of him. He concluded an inglorious peace with the Parthians, which assured Mesopotamia to Rome through the payment of large sums of money. And to make himself popular, he canceled Caracalla’s tax increases and reduced military expenditures. A plot against him was soon organized: two young grandnephews of Septimius Severus were persuaded by their mothers and especially by their grandmother, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307766" tocid="">Julia Maesa</xref>, the sister of Julia Domna (who had recently died), to reach for imperial power. The eldest, Bassianus, was presented to the troops of Syria, who had been bought with gold, and was proclaimed in April 218. Shortly afterward, Macrinus was defeated and killed, as was his son (whom he had associated with him on the throne).

                The new emperor was presented as the son of Caracalla, whose name he took (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus). He is better known, however, under the name <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="181888" tocid="">Elagabalus</xref>, the god whose high priest he was and whom he quickly and imprudently attempted to impose on the Romans, in spite of his grandmother’s counsel of moderation.

The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="473662" tocid="">praetorians</xref> killed him in 222 and proclaimed as emperor his first cousin, Alexianus, who took the name of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536782" tocid="">Severus Alexander</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although well educated and full of good intentions, Severus Alexander showed some weakness of character by submitting to the counsel of his mother, Mamaea, and of his grandmother, Maesa. The <e>Scriptores historiae Augustae</e>, a collection of biographies of the emperors, attributes to him a complete program of reforms favourable to the Senate, but these reforms are not mentioned elsewhere. As in the time of Septimius Severus, his counselors were equites. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="613301" tocid="">Ulpian</xref>, the praetorian prefect, was the greatest jurist of this period, and the basic policies of the founder of the dynasty were carried on, but with less energy.

Their initial attacks were stopped in 232 by a campaign that was, however, poorly conducted by the emperor and that alienated the army as a result of its ineptitude. In Rome there were frequent disorders, and, as early as 223, Ulpian had been killed by the praetorians. While gathered on the Rhine to fight the Teutons, the soldiers once again revolted and killed Severus Alexander and his mother. A coarse and uneducated but energetic soldier, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370547" tocid="">Maximinus</xref> the Thracian, succeeded him without difficulty in March 235. The Severan dynasty had come to an end.

            <p>
              On the right bank of the Tiber in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">Rome</xref>, in the least fashionable section of town among Lebanese and Jewish labourers, Elagabalus built an elegant temple to his ancestral god; he was no doubt in those precincts very well received when he presided personally at its inauguration. Yet the world that counted, the world of senators and centurions, reacted with indignation. Within the capital the ruler was expected to honour the gods of the capital, the ancient Roman ones. At the same time, it was deemed appropriate that he reverently recognize other gods, in their place; for this reason a biography presenting Severus Alexander for the reader’s admiration records how scrupulously he offered worship on the Capitoline to Jupiter, while also having, in a chapel attached to his domestic quarters, the images of his <e>lares</e> (household gods), of the deified emperors of most beloved memory, and of such superhuman beings as the Greeks would have called “heroes,” including Apollonius the holy man of Tyana, Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus. The furnishing of the chapel is described by a most dubious source; but if it is not history, it is at least revealing of ideals. A Roman ruler was to express not only the piety of the capital and its citizens but also that of all his people throughout his empire. Imperial religion was properly compounded of both Roman and non-Roman piety.
            </p>
            <p>Official religion can hardly be said to have existed in the sense of being pressed on people by the state. But the statement needs qualification. The cults of Rome were certainly official in the city itself; they were supported out of the state treasury and by the devotion of the emperor, at least if he lived up to what everyone felt were his responsibilities. In the army, too, camps had shrines in which portraits of the emperor were displayed for veneration on certain days of the year. A 3rd-century calendar has been found in an Eastern city that specifies for the garrison regiment the religious ceremonies to be carried out during the year, including a number of the oldest and most traditional ones in Rome. Many Western cities accorded special size and prominence to a temple in which Jupiter or the imperial family or both together were worshiped not by orders from on high, it is true, but spontaneously. The ubiquity of the imperial cult has already been emphasized. All these manifestations of piety gave some quality of “Romanness” to the religion of the empire.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the empire had been assembled from a great number of parts, whose peoples already had their own way of life fully matured; they were not about to surrender it nor, in fact, were they ever asked to do so by their conquerors. What characterized the religious life of the empire as a whole was the continued vitality of local cults in combination with a generally reverent awareness of one’s neighbours’ cults. The emperor, for example, might openly offer personal veneration to his favourite god, a god outside the traditional Roman circle, while also practicing a more conventional piety. When he was on his travels, he would offer cult at the chief shrines of all the localities he visited. What was expected of the emperor was expected of everyone: respectful toleration of all components in the religious amalgam. Of course, there were differences according to individual temperament and degree of education; approaches to religion might be literal or philosophical, fervent or relaxed. Rural society was more conservative than urban. But the whole can fairly be called an integrated system.</p>
            <p>
              Just as the special power of the Greek gods had gained recognition among the Etruscans and, subsequently, among the Romans in remote centuries <e ty="s">bc</e> or as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="523970" tocid="">Serapis</xref> in Hellenistic times had come to be worshiped in scattered parts of the Ptolemies’ realm—Macedonia and Ionia, for example—so at last the news of unfamiliar gods was carried by their worshipers to distant places in the Roman Empire where, too, they worked their wonders, attracted reverent attention, and received a pillared lodging, a priesthood, and daily offerings. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447447" tocid="">Pax Romana</xref> encouraged a great deal more than commerce in material objects. It made inevitable the exchange of ideas in a more richly woven and complex fabric than the Mediterranean world had ever seen, in which the Phrygian Cybele was at home also in Gaul and the Italian Silvanus in northern Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              Religious developments in the Eastern provinces during the centuries from Augustus to Severus Alexander followed a somewhat different course from those in the West. In the East the further jumbling together of already well-mixed traditions encouraged a tolerance that eroded their edges. It became possible to see predominant similarities in Selene, Artemis, and Isis, in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="656752" tocid="">Zeus</xref>, Iarhibol, Helios, and Serapis, or in Cybele, Ma, and Bellona. From recognition of basic similarities one might reason to a sort of monotheism, by the lights of which, for persons given to theology, local deities were no more than narrow expressions of greater truths. A juncture was then natural with Neoplatonism, the school of philosophy that later came to be held in high regard.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, in Italy, the Danube provinces, and the Western provinces, religious change and development can be more easily seen in the immigration of worshipers of Easter deities. Those took root and became popular—none more so than Mithra, though Isis, Cybele, and Jupiter of Doliche were close behind. Apuleius in the closing chapters of his novel usually called <e>
                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="237490" tocid="">The Golden Ass</xref>
              </e> in English describes how a young man is brought from mere consciousness of Isis as a famous goddess with certain well-known rites and attributes, to a single-minded devotion to her. Aelius Aristides, a famous rhetorician of the time, recounts in his spiritual diary the development of a similar devotion in himself to Asclepius. Both the fictional and the factual account give a central place to benefits miraculously granted. It was by such means that piety was ordinarily warmed to a special fervour, whether or not that process should be called conversion. In any case, it produced the testimonies—votive inscriptions, temples, and so forth—through which it is possible to trace the spread of foreign cults. Eastern cults, however, also introduced to the West complex liturgies, beliefs underlying beliefs that could be explained in especially dramatic ways to special devotees (“mysteries”), and much rich symbolism. Of no cult was this more true than <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="386080" tocid="">Mithraism</xref>, known to the 20th century through excavation of the underground shrines that it preferred.

                The rise of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115240" tocid="">Christianity</xref>
              </headtitle>
              <p>
                During the 1st and 2nd centuries, Christianity spread with relative slowness. The doctrines of Jesus, who was crucified about <e ty="s">ad</e> 30, first took root among the Jews of Palestine, where a large number of sects were proliferating—orthodox sects, such as the Sadducees and the Pharisees, as well as dissident and sometimes persecuted sects such as the Essenes, whose ascetic practices have been illuminated by the discovery of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154274" tocid="">Dead Sea Scrolls</xref> in the mid-20th century. At the end of Tiberius’ reign, Christianity had spread to the gentiles as a result of the preaching of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">St. Paul</xref> in Anatolia and in Greece. At the same time, Christianity continued to make progress among the Jews of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Syria and quickly reached even Osroëne and the Parthian towns of the Euphrates, where Jewish colonies were numerous. The Roman authorities at first had difficulty in distinguishing the “Christos” believers from the orthodox Jews, but the religion of the former, on leaving its original milieu, quickly became differentiated.
              </p>
              <p>A familiar charge against the Jews, however, continued to pursue the Christians: that they felt a hatred of mankind. Their expectation of the end of the world aroused a suspicion that that was what they indeed desired; moreover, they were also suspect for their aloofness—they cut themselves off from family and community—and for their meetings, whose purpose was obscure. Their 2nd-century spokesmen had to dispel the belief, often recorded, that they practiced magic involving cannibalism; further, that they indulged in sex orgies, incestuous to boot; and, the most common accusation of all, that they were atheists—people who denied the existence of the gods and rejected accepted cults. This last charge, which was, of course, exactly on the mark, must be set in the context of occasional episodes of mob violence against (non-Christian) atheists or doubters. Here the association of Christians with Jews, equally monotheistic, might have provided some protection for the Christians, but the Jews were faithful to a cult of the greatest antiquity and, moreover, had long made their peace with Caesar, Augustus, and their successors. It was a peace that could not extend to people who had (it would be alleged) apostasized from their own Judaism. Christians did not participate in the Jewish revolt of 66–73, and, under the Flavians, Christianity completely severed itself from its origins.</p>
              <p>
                At this time the East was the centre of the new religion, whose followers grew in numbers from Egypt to the Black Sea and were beginning to be noticed in Bithynia and in Greece. Christians seemed fairly numerous in Rome as early as the end of the 1st century. When the age of the Apostles ended, the age of the church began, with its bishops, presbyters, and deacons, with its catechism, preaching, and celebration of the Eucharist. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to reach the intellectuals. Hellenistic culture offered educated Christians the resources of philosophical dialectic and of sophist rhetoric. The example of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456612" tocid="">Philo of Alexandria</xref> had shown in the 1st century that it was possible to reconcile the Bible with the great Platonic ideas. By the 2nd century the Christian “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30100" tocid="">apologists</xref>” tried to show that Christianity was in harmony with Greco-Roman humanism and that it was intellectually, and above all morally, superior to paganism.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the Christians did not succeed in convincing the authorities. The first persecution, that of Nero, was related to a devastating fire in the capital in 64, for which the Christians were blamed or, perhaps, only made the scapegoats. In any case, their position as bad people (<e>mali homines</e> of the sort a governor should try to suppress) had been established, and later suppressions could be justified by reference to “the Neronian practice.” So far as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="143120" tocid="">criminal law</xref> was concerned, such a precedent had considerable authority, of the sort that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="464843" tocid="">Pliny</xref>, as governor, was looking for in his handling of the Christians of Bithynia-Pontus in 111. His master, the emperor Trajan, told him not to seek them out but to execute those who, being informed against, refused to abjure their religion. Hadrian and other successors hewed to the same line thereafter. Thus, the persecutions remained localized and sporadic and were the result of private denunciations or of spontaneous popular protests. Under Marcus Aurelius, the difficulties of the times often caused the Christians, who refused to sacrifice to the state gods and to participate in the imperial cult, to be accused of provoking the wrath of the gods: martyrs appeared in the East, in Rome, in Gaul, and in Africa. Commodus’ reign was more favourable to them, perhaps because certain members of his circle, not a very edifying one in other respects, were Christians or Christian sympathizers. This reprieve, however, was short-lived: Septimius Severus inaugurated the first systematic persecution. In 202 an edict forbade Christian (and Jewish) proselytism. Members of extremist sects were persecuted for preaching continence (which violated Augustus’ laws against celibacy), for holding the state in contempt, and especially for refusing military service. Under Caracalla, the situation quieted, and the church continued to progress, favoured perhaps by the relative freedom that the law granted to funerary <e>collegia</e> (whence the first catacombs).

                A Greek renaissance, however, took place during the 2nd century. The Second Sophistic school reigned in every area: in rhetoric, history, philosophy, and even in the sciences. Schools of rhetoric and philosophy prospered in the East—in Smyrna, Ephesus, Pergamum, Rhodes, Alexandria, and even in Athens—protected and subsidized by the emperors, from Vespasian to Marcus Aurelius. The great sophists were <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="263483" tocid="">Herodes Atticus</xref>, a multimillionaire from Athens; Polemon; and Aelius Aristides, a valetudinarian devotee of Asclepius. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="164018" tocid="">Dio Cassius</xref> and Herodian were conscientious and useful historians (first half of the 3rd century), as was later Dexippus the Athenian, whose work survives only in fragments. Science was represented by the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa; medicine, by Galen of Pergamum; astronomy, by the Alexandrian Ptolemy. Law remained the only Roman science, exemplified under the Antonines by Salvius Julianus and Gaius (the <e>Institutiones</e>) and rising to its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="656495" tocid="">zenith</xref> in the 3rd century as a result of the works of three jurists: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="442142" tocid="">Papinian</xref>, Ulpian, and Modestinus.

Under Marcus Aurelius, one of Lucian’s friends, Celsus, wrote the first serious criticism of Christianity, “The True Word,” known through Origen’s refutation of it in the 3rd century. At this time philosophy leaned toward religious mysticism: under the Severans, Ammonius Saccas created the school of Alexandria, and his disciple Plotinus founded the Neoplatonist school, which was to fight bitterly against Christianity. After the apologists and, above all, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="588511" tocid="">Tertullian</xref> (<e>c.</e> 160–after 222), Christian thought deepened, and theology made its appearance. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref> (<e>c.</e> 185–<e>c.</e> 254), the greatest theologian of the time, were the luminaries of the church of Alexandria; the Roman church still wrote in Greek and was represented by the slightly old-fashioned <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="266682" tocid="">Hippolytus</xref>; and the church of Africa had a powerful personality, St. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage.

He moved constantly between the Rhine and the Danube, achieving brilliant victories (Milan in 262, the Nestus in 267), but the Pannonian army raised several competitors against him (Ingenuus, Regalianus, Aureolus). Too busy to protect the Gauls against the Franks and the Alemanni and the East against the Persians, he had to tolerate the formation of the Gallic empire under the praetorian prefect <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="472293" tocid="">Marcus Cassianius Postumus</xref> (259–268) and the Palmyrene kingdom of Odenathus (260–267). Some of his reforms were a foreshadowing of the future: the senators were practically excluded from the army; the equites received the majority of commands and of provincial governorships; and the composition of the army was modified by the creation of new army corps and especially of a strong cavalry, which was placed under the command of a single leader and charged with closing the breaches that the barbarians were opening along the frontiers. Upon his father’s death Gallienus had put an end to the persecution of the Christians, preferring to fight the new religion through intellectual means; to that end, he favoured the ancient Greek cults (Demeter of Eleusis) and protected the Neoplatonist philosopher Plotinus. These initiatives increased the number of his enemies, particularly among the patriotic senators and the Pannonian generals. While Gallienus was in Milan besieging the usurper Aureolus, he was killed by his chiefs of staff, who proclaimed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120521" tocid="">Claudius</xref> II (268), the first of the Illyrian emperors. The new emperor won a great victory against the Alemanni on the Garda lake and overwhelmed the Goths in Naissus (269) but died of the plague in 270. This fatal period brought to light one of the major defects of the empire: the lack of a legitimate principle of succession and the preponderant role of the army in politics. The structures that had created the strength of the principate were weakened, and the empire required deep reforms. Gallienus had felt their necessity but had been too weak to impose them.

The aftereffect of their march to the southeast, toward the Black Sea, was to push the Marcomanni, the Quadi, and the Sarmatians onto the Roman <e>limes</e> in Marcus Aurelius’ time. Their presence was brusquely revealed when they attacked the Greek towns on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="68234" tocid="">Black Sea</xref> about 238. Timesitheus fought against them under Gordian III, and under Philip and Decius they besieged the towns of Moesia and Thrace, led by their kings, Ostrogotha and Kniva. Beginning in 253, the Crimean Goths and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="263960" tocid="">Heruli</xref> appeared and dared to venture on the seas, ravaging the shores of the Black Sea and the Aegean as well as several <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244231" tocid="">Greek</xref> towns. In 267 Athens was taken and plundered despite a strong defense by the historian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="160506" tocid="">Dexippus</xref>. After the victories of Gallienus on the Nestus and Claudius at Naissus (Nish), there was for a time less danger. But the countries of the middle Danube were still under pressure by the Marcomanni, Quadi, Iazyges, Sarmatians, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="96792" tocid="">Carpi</xref> of free Dacia, who were later joined by the Roxolani and the Vandals. In spite of stubborn resistance, Dacia was gradually overwhelmed, and it was abandoned by the Roman troops, though not evacuated officially. When Valerian was captured in <e ty="s">ad</e> 259/260, the Pannonians were gravely threatened, and Regalianus, one of the usurpers proclaimed by the Pannonian legions, died fighting the invaders. The defense was concentrated around Sirmium and Siscia-Poetovio, the ancient fortresses that had been restored by Gallienus, and many cities were burned.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the West the invasions were particularly violent. The Germans and the Gauls were driven back several times by the confederated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="217113" tocid="">Frankish</xref> tribes of the North Sea coast and by the Alemanni from the middle and upper Rhine. Gallienus fought bitterly, concentrating his defense around Mainz and Cologne, but the usurpations in Pannonia prevented him from obtaining any lasting results. In 259–260 the Alemanni came through the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="9510" tocid="">Agri Decumates</xref> (the territory around the Black Forest), which was now lost to the Romans. Some of the Alemanni headed for Italy across the Alpine passes; others attacked Gaul, devastating the entire eastern part of the country. Passing through the Rhône Valley, they eventually reached the Mediterranean; and some bands even continued into Spain. There they joined the Franks, many of whom had come by ship from the North Sea, after having plundered the western part of Gaul. Sailing up the estuaries of the great rivers, they had reached Spain and then, crossing the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="233262" tocid="">Strait of Gibraltar</xref>, had proceeded to Mauretania Tingitana. Gallienus, outflanked, entrusted Gaul and his young son Saloninus to Postumus, who then killed Saloninus and proclaimed himself emperor. The several invasions had so frightened the people that the new emperor was readily accepted, even in Spain and Britain. He devoted himself first to the defense of the country and was finally considered a legitimate emperor, having established himself as a rival to Gallienus, who had tried in vain to eliminate him but finally had to tolerate him. Postumus governed with moderation, and, in good Roman fashion, minted excellent coins. He, too, was killed by his soldiers, but he had successors who lasted until 274.

              <headtitle>Difficulties in the East</headtitle>
              <p>
                In the East the frontiers had been fixed by Hadrian at the Euphrates. But under Nero, the Romans had claimed control over the kings of Armenia, and under Caracalla they had annexed Osroëne and Upper Mesopotamia. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="444876" tocid="">Parthian empire</xref> had been weak and often troubled, but the Sāsānids were more dangerous. In 241, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="538703" tocid="">Shāpūr I</xref> (Sapor), an ambitious organizer and statesman, mounted the throne: he united his empire by bringing the Iranian lords into line and by protecting the Zoroastrian religion. He also tolerated the Manichaeans and put an end to the persecutions of the Christians and Jews, thereby gaining the sympathy of these communities. In 252, with a large army at his command, Shāpūr imposed Artavasdes on Armenia, attacked Mesopotamia, and took <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422748" tocid="">Nisibis</xref>. In 256 his advance troops entered Cappadocia and Syria and plundered Antioch, while Doura-Europus, on the middle Euphrates, was likewise falling to him. Valerian had rushed to its aid, but he could not remedy the situation; and in 259 or 260 he was imprisoned by Shāpūr during operations about which little is known. Mesopotamia was lost and Rome was pushed back to the Euphrates. Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Syria were again plundered, and a puppet emperor was appointed in Antioch. But these victories were transitory: in Osroëne, Edessa had shown resistance, a defense was organized in Cappadocia and Cilicia, and Odenathus, the prince of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="440255" tocid="">Palmyra</xref>, took Shāpūr by surprise and forced him back to Iran. Having thus aided the Roman cause, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="424990" tocid="">Odenathus</xref> then began to act in his own interest: he continued the fight against the Persians and took the title “King of Kings.” The Romans officially entrusted him with the defense of the East and conferred on him the governorship of several provinces; the “kingdom” of Palmyra thus extended from Cilicia to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31566" tocid="">Arabia</xref>. He was murdered in 267 without ever having severed his ties with Gallienus. His widow <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="656544" tocid="">Zenobia</xref> had her husband’s titles granted to their son Vaballathus. Then in 270, taking advantage of the deaths of Gallienus and Claudius II, she invaded Egypt and a part of Anatolia. This invasion was followed by a rupture with Rome, and in 271 Vaballathus was proclaimed Imperator Caesar Augustus. The latent separatism of the Eastern provinces and, undoubtedly, some commercial advantages caused them to accept Palmyrene domination without difficulty, as they had, in the past, supported Avidius Cassius and Pescennius Niger against the legitimate emperors. In 272 unity was restored by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43299" tocid="">Aurelian</xref>, but Mesopotamia was lost, and the Euphrates became the new frontier of the empire.

          <h2 tocid="26695">
            <headtitle>Economic and social crisis</headtitle>
            <p>
              The invasions and the civil wars worked in combination to disrupt and weaken the empire over a span of half a century. Things were at their worst in the 260s, but the entire period from 235 to 284 brought the empire close to collapse. Many regions were laid waste (northern Gaul, Dacia, Moesia, Thrace, and numerous towns on the Aegean); many important cities had been pillaged or destroyed (Byzantium, Antioch, Olbia, Lugdunum); and northern Italy (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118628" tocid="">Cisalpine Gaul</xref>) had been overrun by the Alemanni. During the crisis, the emperor either focused his forces on the defense of one point, inviting attack at another, or he left some embattled frontier altogether to its own devices; any commander who proved successful had the emperorship thrust upon him, on the very heels of his victories over the invaders. Counting several sons and brothers, more than 40 emperors thus established themselves for a reign of some sort, long or (more often) short. The political destabilization fed on itself, but it also was responsible for heavy expenditure of life and treasure. To keep pace with the latter, successive emperors rapidly and radically reduced the percentage of precious metal in the standard silver coins to almost nothing so as to spread it over larger issues. What thus became a fiduciary currency held up not too badly until the 260s, when confidence collapsed and people rushed to turn the money they had into goods of real value. An incredible inflation got under way, lasting for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              The severity of damage done to the empire by the political and economic destabilization is not easily estimated since for this period the sources of every sort are extremely poor. Common sense would suggest that commerce was disrupted, taxes collected more harshly and unevenly, homes and harvests destroyed, the value of savings lost to inflation, and the economy in general badly shaken. A severe <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="462675" tocid="">plague</xref> is reported that lasted for years in mid-century, producing terrible casualties. In some western areas, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32572" tocid="">archaeology</xref> provides illustration of what one might expect: cities in Gaul were walled, usually in much reduced circuits; villas here and there throughout the Rhine and Danube provinces also were walled; road systems were defended by lines of fortlets in northern Gaul and adjoining Germany; and a few areas, such as Brittany, were abandoned or relapsed into pre-Roman primitiveness. Off the coasts of that peninsula and elsewhere, too, piracy reigned; on land, brigandage occurred on a large scale. The reentrant triangle of land between the upper Danube and upper Rhine had to be permanently abandoned to the barbarians around it in about 260. The Pax Romana had then, in all these manifest ways, been seriously disrupted. On the other hand, in Egypt, where inflation is most amply documented, its harmful effects cannot be detected. The Egyptian economy showed no signs of collapse. Furthermore, some regions—most of Britain, for example—emerged from the half-century of crisis in a more prosperous condition than before. A summary of the effects of crisis can only underline one single fact that is almost self-evident: the wonders of civilization attained under the Antonines required an essentially political base. They required a strong, stable monarchy in command of a strong army. If either or both were seriously disturbed, the economy would suffer, along with the civilization’s ease and brilliance. If, on the other hand, the political base could be restored, the health of the empire as a whole was not beyond recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, certain broad changes unconnected with the political and economic crisis were going forward in the 3rd century. Civilians increasingly complained of harassment and extortion by troops stationed among them; exaction of taxes intended for the army also became the target of more frequent complaint; and demands by soldiers to interfere in civilian government, foremost by those stationed in the capital, grew more insolent. The choice of emperor became more and more openly the prerogative of the military, not the Senate; and, as mentioned, in the 260s senators were being largely displaced from high military commands. The equestrian rank, in which persons risen from military careers were often to be found, was the beneficiary of the new policy. In sum, the power of the military, high and low, was asserting itself against that of the civilians. From this change, further, there flowed certain cultural consequences; for, continuing the tendencies detectable even in the 1st century, the army was increasingly recruited from the most backward areas, above all, from the Danubian provinces. Here, too—indeed, throughout the whole northern glacis of the empire—it had been state policy to allow entire tribes of barbarians to immigrate and to settle on vacant lands, where they dwelled, farmed, paid taxes, and offered their sons to the army. Such immigrants, in increasingly large numbers from the reign of Marcus Aurelius on, produced, with the rural population, a very non-Romanized mix. From the midst of just such people, Maximinus mounted to the throne in 235, and later, likewise, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223951" tocid="">Galerius</xref> (Caesar from 293). It is quite appropriate aesthetically, from Aurelian on, that these later 3rd-century rulers chose to present themselves to their subjects in their propaganda with stubbly chin, set jaw, and close-cropped hair on a bullet head.

              <p>
                After Claudius II’s unexpected death, the empire was ruled from 270 to 284 by several “Illyrian” emperors, who were good generals and who tried in an energetic way to restore equilibrium. The most remarkable was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43299" tocid="">Aurelian</xref>. He first gained hard-won victories over the Alemanni and the Juthungi, who had invaded the Alpine provinces and northern Italy. To cheer the inhabitants of Rome, who had succumbed to panic, he began construction of the famous rampart known as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43308" tocid="">Aurelian’s Wall</xref>. And while crossing the Danubian provinces, before marching against Palmyra, he decided on an orderly evacuation of Dacia, an undefendable region that had been occupied by the barbarians since the time of Gallienus. In the East, he defeated Zenobia’s troops easily and occupied Palmyra in 272. Shortly afterward, an uprising broke out in Egypt under the instigation of a rich merchant, who, like a great part of the population, was a partisan of the Palmyrene queen. In response, Aurelian undertook a second campaign, plundering Palmyra and subjugating Alexandria. These troubles, however, along with the devastation of the great caravan city, were to set back Roman trade seriously in the East. Later, rounding back on the Gallic empire of Postumus’ successors, he easily defeated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="589138" tocid="">Tetricus</xref>, a peaceful man not very willing to fight, near Cabillonum. The unity of the empire was restored, and Aurelian celebrated a splendid triumph in Rome. He also reestablished discipline in the state, sternly quelled a riot of artisans in the mints of Rome, organized the provisioning of the city by militarizing several corporations (the bakers, the pork merchants), and tried to stop the inflation by minting an antoninianus of sounder value. His religious policy was original: in order to strengthen the moral unity of the empire and his own power, he declared himself to be the protégé of the Sol Invictus (the Invincible Sun) and built a magnificent temple for this god with the Palmyrene spoils. Aurelian was also sometimes officially called <e>dominus et deus</e>: the principate had definitely been succeeded by the “dominate.” In 275 Aurelian was murdered by certain officers who mistakenly believed that their lives were in danger.

                For once, his successor, the aged senator Tacitus, was chosen by the Senate—at the army’s request and on short notice; he reigned only for a few months. After him, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477638" tocid="">Probus</xref>, another Illyrian general, inherited a fortified empire but had to fight hard in Gaul, where serious invasions occurred in 275–277. Thereafter, Probus devoted himself to economic restoration; he attempted to return abandoned farmland to cultivation and, with the aid of military labour, undertook works of improvement. To remedy the depopulation, he admitted to the empire, as had Aurelian, a great number of defeated Goths, Alemanni, and Franks and permitted them to settle on plots of land in Gaul and in the Danubian provinces. After the assassination of Probus in 282 by soldiers, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="97569" tocid="">Carus</xref> became emperor and immediately associated with himself his two sons, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="95923" tocid="">Carinus</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422382" tocid="">Numerian</xref>.

              <p>
                Diocletian may be considered the real founder of the late empire, though the form of government he established—the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="589118" tocid="">tetrarchy</xref>, or four persons sharing power simultaneously—was transitory. His reforms, however, lasted longer. Military exigencies, not the desire to apply a preconceived system, explain the successive nomination of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370442" tocid="">Maximian</xref> as Caesar and later as Augustus in 286 and of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134077" tocid="">Constantius</xref> and Galerius as Caesars in 293. The tetrarchy was a collegium of emperors comprising two groups: at its head, two Augusti, older men who made the decisions; and, in a secondary position, two Caesars, younger, with a more executive role. All four were related either by adoption or by marriage, and all were Illyrians who had attained high commands after a long military career. Of the four, only Diocletian was a statesman. The unity of the empire was safeguarded, despite appearances, for there was no territorial partitioning. Each emperor received troops and a sector of operation: Maximian, Italy and Africa; Constantius, Gaul and Britain; Galerius, the Danubian countries; and Diocletian, the East. Practically all governmental decisions were made by Diocletian, from whom the others had received their power. He legislated, designated consuls, and retained precedence. After 287 he declared his kinship with the god <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308395" tocid="">Jupiter</xref> (Jove), who Diocletian claimed was his special protector. Diocletian, together with his Caesar Galerius, formed the “Jovii” dynasty, whereas Maximian and Constantius, claiming descent from the mythical hero Hercules, formed the “Herculii.” This “Epiphany of the Tetrarchs” served as the divine foundation of the regime. The ideological recourse to two traditional Roman divinities represented a break with the Orientalizing attempts of Elagabalus and Aurelian. Even though he honoured Mithra equally, Diocletian wanted to be seen as continuing the work of Augustus. In dividing power, Diocletian’s aim was to avoid usurpations, or at least to stifle them quickly—as in the attempt of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="94579" tocid="">Carausius</xref>, chief of the army of Britain, who was killed (293), as was his successor, Allectus (296), after a landing by Constantius.
              </p>
              <p>
                The deification of the imperial function, marked by elaborate rituals, tended to set the emperors above the rest of mankind. But it was still necessary to avoid future rivalries and to assure the tetrarchy a legitimate and regular succession. Some time between 300 and 303 Diocletian found an original solution. After the anniversary of their 20-year reign the two Augusti abdicated (Maximian quite unwillingly), and on the same day (May 1, 305) the two Caesars became Augusti. Two new Caesars were chosen, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="536752" tocid="">Severus</xref> and Maximinus Daia, both friends of Galerius, whose strong personality dominated Constantius. In repudiating the principle of natural heredity (Maximian and Constantius each had an adult son), Diocletian took a great risk: absolute divine monarchy, which Diocletian largely established, implies the hereditary transmission of power, and the future was soon to demonstrate the attachment of the troops and even of the population to the hereditary principle.

                In order to create a more efficient unity between subjects and administrators, Diocletian multiplied the number of provinces; even Italy was divided into a dozen small units of the provincial type. Rome, moreover, was no longer the effective capital of the empire, each emperor having his own residence in the part of the empire over which he ruled (Trier, Milan, Sirmium, Nicomedia). Although a few provinces were still governed by senators (proconsuls or consuls), the majority were given to equestrian <e>praesides</e>, usually without any military power but with responsibility for the entirety of civil administration (justice, police, finances, and taxes). The cities lost their autonomy, and the curiales administered and collected the taxes under the governor’s direct control. The breaking up of the provinces was compensated for by their regrouping into a dozen <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="164027" tocid="">dioceses</xref>, under equestrian vicars who were responsible to the emperor alone. The two praetorian prefects had less military power but played an important role in legislative, judicial, and above all, financial matters: the administration of the <e>annona</e>, which had become the basis of the fiscal system, in fact gave them management of the entire economy. Within the central administration the number of offices increased, their managers being civilians who carried out their functions as a regular career. All officials were enrolled in the <e>

                Great efforts were devoted to strengthening the borders, and the <e>limes</e> were outfitted with fortresses (<e>castella</e>) and small forts (<e>burgi</e>), notably in Syria. The army’s strength was increased to 60 legions (but with reduced personnel); and, in principle, each border province received a garrison of two legions, complemented by subsidiary troops. Adopting one of Gallienus’ ideas, Diocletian created an embryonic tactical army under the direct orders of the emperor whose escort (<e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127657" tocid="">comitatus</xref>
                </e>) it formed. The troops were most often commanded by <e>duces</e> and <e>praepositi</e> rather than by provincial governors and were mainly recruited from among the sons of soldiers and from barbarians who enlisted individually or by whole tribes. In addition, the landowners had to provide either recruits or a corresponding sum of money. All of these reforms were instituted gradually, during defensive wars whose success demonstrated the regime’s efficiency. Constantius put down Carausius’ attempted usurpation and fought the Alemanni fiercely near Basel; Maximian first hunted down the Bagaudae (gangs of fugitive peasant brigands) in Gaul, then fought the Moorish tribes in Africa, in 296–298, triumphing at Carthage; and on the Danube, Diocletian, and later Galerius, conquered the Bastarnae, the Iazyges, and the Carpi, deporting them in large numbers to the provinces. In the East, however, the opposition of the Persians, led by the enterprising <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="403689" tocid="">Narses</xref>, extended from Egypt to Armenia. The Persians incited uprisings by both the Blemmyes nomads in southern Egypt and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="523863" tocid="">Saracens</xref> of the Syrian desert and made use of anti-Roman propaganda by the Manichaeans and Jews. Diocletian succeeded in putting down the revolt in Egypt and fortified the south against the Blemmyes. But in 297, Narses, the heir to Shāpūr’s ambitions, precipitated a war by taking Armenia, Osroëne, and part of Syria. After an initial defeat, Galerius won a great victory over Narses, and in 298 the peace of Nisibis reinstated a Roman protégé in Armenia and gave the empire a part of Upper Mesopotamia that extended even beyond the Tigris. Peace was thus assured for some decades.

              <p>
                The wars, the reforms, and the increase in the number of officials were costly, and inflation reduced the resources of the state. The <e>annona</e>, set up by Septimius Severus, had proved imperfect, and Diocletian now reformed it through the <e>jugatio-capitatio</e> system: henceforth, the land tax, paid in kind by all landowners, would be calculated by the assessment of fiscal units based on extent and quality of land, type of crops grown, number of settlers and cattle, and amount of equipment. The fiscal valuation of each piece of property, estimated in <e>juga</e> and <e>capita</e> (interchangeable terms whose use varied by region and period of time), required a number of declarations and censuses similar to those practiced long before in Egypt. Each year, the government established the rate of tax per fiscal unit; and every 15 years, beginning in 312, taxes were reassessed. This complicated system was not carried out uniformly in every region. Nevertheless, it resulted in an improved accounting of the empire’s resources and a certain progress in fiscal equity, thus making the administration’s heavy demands less unbearable. In addition, Diocletian wished to reorganize the coinage and stabilize inflation. He thus minted improved sterling coins and fixed their value in relation to a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="237431" tocid="">gold standard</xref>. Nevertheless, inflation again became disturbing by the end of the century, and Diocletian proclaimed his well-known Edictum de Maximis Pretiis, fixing price ceilings for foodstuffs and for goods and services, which could not be exceeded under pain of death. The edict had indifferent results and was scarcely applied, but the inscriptions revealing it have great economic interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Diocletian’s reforms adumbrated the principal features of late Roman society: a society defined in all parts that could be useful to the state by laws fixing status and, through status, responsibility. The persons owning grain mills in Rome were (to anticipate developments that continued to unfold throughout the next two or three generations) responsible for the delivery of flour for the dole and could not bequeath or withdraw any part of their capital from their enterprise. Several other labour groups were similarly restricted, such as owners of seagoing vessels that served the supply of Rome, bargees in the Tiber, Ostian grain handlers, distributors of olive oil and pork for the dole, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55888" tocid="">bath</xref> managers, and limeburners. A ban on moving to some other home or job along with production quotas were placed on people in trades serving state factories that made imperial court and army garments, cavalry equipment, and arms. Diocletian built a number of such factories, some in his capital Nicomedia, others in cities close to the groups whose needs they served. The laws imposing these obligations affected only labour groups serving the army and the capital (or capitals, plural, after the promotion of Constantinople); and, to identify them, induce them to serve, and hold them in their useful work, emperors as early as Claudius had offered privileges and imposed controls. Diocletian, however, greatly increased the weight and complexity of all these obligations.
              </p>
              <p>Diocletian also changed the administrative districts in Egypt, in keeping with the model found elsewhere, by designating in each a central city to take responsibility for the whole. The last anomalous province was thus brought into line with the others. Everywhere, the imperial government continued to count on the members of the municipal senate to serve it, above all in tax collection but also in the supply of recruits, in rural police work, billeting for troops, or road building. As had been the case for centuries, they had to have a minimum of landed property to serve as surety for the performance of their administrative duties as well as to submit to nomination as senator, if it was so determined by the Senate. There had never been any one law to that effect, but by Diocletian’s time the emperor had at his command a body of long-established custom and numerous imperial decisions that served just as well. Local elites were thus hereditary, compulsory agents of his purpose, exactly like the Tiber bargees.</p>
              <p>
                Two other groups were frozen into their roles in the same fashion: soldiers and farmers. The sons of soldiers were required to take up their fathers’ occupation (a law to that effect was in operation at least by 313); and the natural tendency of tenant farmers (<e>coloni</e>) to renew their lease on land that they, and perhaps their fathers and grandfathers, had worked was confirmed by imperial decisions—to such effect that, in 332, Constantine could speak of tenants on his Sardinian estates as bound to the acres they cultivated. This is the earliest explicit pronouncement on what is called the “colonate.” Soon the institution was extended beyond imperial estates to tie certain categories of tenants to private estates as well. The emperors wanted to ensure tax revenue and, for that, a stable rural labour supply.
              </p>
              <p>The empire, as it is seen in abundant legislation for the period of Diocletian and beyond into the 5th century, has been called a “military dictatorship” or even a sort of totalitarian prison, in which every inhabitant had his own cell and his own shackles. This may well have been the rulers’ intent. By their lights, such a system was needed to repair the weaknesses revealed in the 3rd-century crisis. The principle of hereditary obligations was not, after all, so very strange, set against the natural tendencies of the economy and the practices that had developed in earlier, easier times. Yet Diocletian’s intentions could not be fully realized, given the limits on governmental effectiveness.</p>
              <p>
                After a period of initial indifference toward the Christians, Diocletian ended his reign by unleashing against them, in 303, the last and most violent of their persecutions. It was urged on him by his Caesar Galerius and prolonged in the East for a decade (until 311) by Galerius as Augustus and by other emperors. As in earlier persecutions, the initiative arose at the heart of government; some emperors, as outraged by the Christians as many private citizens, considered it their duty to maintain harmony with the gods, the <e>pax deorum</e>, by which alone the empire flourished. Accordingly, Decius and Valerian in the 250s had dealt severely with the Christians, requiring them to demonstrate their apostasy by offering sacrifice at the local temples, and for the first time had directly struck the church’s clergy and property. There were scores of Christians who preferred death, though the great majority complied or hid themselves. Within a matter of months after he had begun his attacks, however, Decius had died (251), and the bloody phase of Valerian’s attacks also lasted only months (259/260). His son Gallienus had issued an edict of tolerance, and Aurelian was even appealed to by the church of Antioch to settle an internal dispute. Christianity had now become open and established, thanks to the power of its God so often, it seemed, manifested in miraculous acts and to the firmness with which converts were secured in a new life and community. The older slanders—cannibalism and incest—that had troubled the Apologists in the 2nd century no longer commanded credence. A measure of respectability had been won, along with recruits from the upper classes and gifts of land and money. By the end of the 3rd century Christians actually predominated in some of the smaller Eastern towns or districts, and they were well represented in Italy, Gaul, and Africa around Carthage; all told, they numbered perhaps as many as 5 million out of the empire’s total population of 60 million. Occasional meetings on disputed matters might bring together dozens of bishops, and it was this institution or phenomenon that the Great Persecutions sought to defeat. The progress of a religion that could not accept the religious basis of the tetrarchy and certain of whose members were imprudent and provocative, as in the incidents at Nicomedia (where a church was built across from Diocletian’s palace), finally aroused Galerius’ fanaticism. In 303–304 several edicts, each increasingly stringent, ordered the destruction of the churches, the seizure of sacred books, the imprisonment of the clergy, and a sentence of death for all those who refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods. In the East, where Galerius was imposing his ideas more and more on the aging Diocletian, the persecution was extremely violent, especially in Egypt, Palestine, and the Danubian regions. In Italy, Maximian, zealous at the beginning, quickly tired; and in Gaul, Constantius merely destroyed a few churches without carrying reprisals any further. Nevertheless, Christianity could no longer be eradicated, for the people of the empire and even some officials no longer felt the blind hatred for Christians that had typified previous centuries.

                The first tetrarchy had ended on May 1, 305; the second did not last long. After Constantius died at Eboracum in 306, the armies of Britain and Gaul, without observing the rules of the tetrarchic system, had hastened to proclaim <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="133873" tocid="">Constantine</xref>, the young son of Constantius, as Augustus.

Thus, in 307–308 there was great confusion.

              </p>
              <p>
                This situation was clarified by successive eliminations. In 310, after numerous intrigues, old Maximian was killed by his son-in-law Constantine, and in the following year Alexander was slain by one of Maxentius’ praetorian prefects. In 311 Galerius died of illness a few days after having admitted the failure of his persecutions by proclaiming an edict of tolerance. There remained, in the West, Constantine and Maxentius and in the East, Licinius and Maximinus Daia. Constantine, the best general, invaded Italy with a strong army of faithful Gauls and defeated Maxentius near the Milvian Bridge, not far from Rome. While attempting to escape, Maxentius drowned. Constantine then made an agreement with Licinius, and the two rallied the Eastern Christians to their side by guaranteeing them religious tolerance in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="382119" tocid="">Edict of Milan</xref> (313). This left Maximinus Daia, now isolated and regarded as a persecutor, in a weak position; attacked by Licinius near Adrianople, he fell ill and died soon afterward, in 313. This left the empire with two leaders, Constantine and Licinius, allied in outward appearances and now brothers-in-law as a result of Licinius’ marriage to Constantine’s sister.

              <p>
                Constantine and Licinius soon disputed among themselves for the empire. Constantine attacked his adversary for the first time in 316, taking the dioceses of Pannonia and Moesia from him. A truce between them lasted 10 years. In 316 Diocletian died in Salona, which he had never felt a desire to leave despite the collapse of his political creation. Constantine and Licinius then reverted to the principles of heredity, designating three potential Caesars from among their respective sons, all still infants, with the intention of securing their dynasties (two sons of Constantine and one of Licinius). The dynastic concept, however, required the existence of only a single emperor, who imposed his own descendance. Although Constantine favoured the Christians, Licinius resumed the persecutions, and in 324 war erupted once again. Licinius, defeated first at Adrianople and then in Anatolia, was obliged to surrender and, together with his son, was executed. Next, Constantine’s third son, Constantius, was in turn named Caesar, as his two elder brothers, Crispus and Constantine the Younger, had been some time before. The second <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="209780" tocid="">Flavian dynasty</xref> was thus founded, and Constantine let it be believed that his father, Flavius Constantius (Chlorus), was descended from Claudius Gothicus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Constantine’s conversion to Christianity had a far-reaching effect. Like his father, he had originally been a votary of the Sun; worshiping at the Grand Temple of the Sun in the Vosges Mountains of Gaul, he had had his first vision—albeit a pagan one. During his campaign against Maxentius, he had had a second vision—a lighted cross in the sky—after which he had painted on his men’s shields a figure that was perhaps Christ’s monogram (although he probably had Christ confused with the Sun in his manifestation as <e>summa</e> <e>divinitas</e> [“the highest divinity”]). After his victory he declared himself Christian. His conversion remains somewhat mysterious and his contemporaries—Lactantius and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196614" tocid="">Eusebius of Caesarea</xref>—are scarcely enlightening and even rather contradictory on the subject. But it was doubtless a sincere conversion, for Constantine had a religious turn of mind. He was also progressive and greatly influenced by the capable bishops who surrounded him from the very beginning.
              </p>
              <p>Until 320–322 solar symbols appeared on Constantine’s monuments and coins, and he was never a great theologian. Yet his favourable policy toward the Christians never faltered. Christianity was still a minority religion in the empire, especially in the West and in the countryside (and consequently within his own army), thus excluding the possibility of any political calculation on his part. But it was enthusiastically welcomed in the East, and thanks to Constantine the new religion triumphed more rapidly; his official support led to the conversion of numerous pagans, although with doubtful sincerity because they were indifferent in their moral conviction.</p>
              <p>
                The church, so recently persecuted, was now suddenly showered with favours: the construction of magnificent churches (Rome, Constantinople), donations and grants, exemptions from decurial duties for the clergy, juridical competences for the bishops, and exceptional promotions for Christian officials. Pagans were not persecuted, however, and Constantine retained the title of <e>pontifex maximus</e>. But he spoke of the pagan gods with contempt and forbade certain types of worship, principally nocturnal sacrifices. In 331 he ordered an inventory of pagan property, despoiled the temples of their treasure, and finally destroyed a few Eastern sanctuaries on the pretext of immorality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The churches were soon to feel the burden of imperial solicitude: the “secular arm” (<e>i.e.</e>, the government) was placed at the service of a fluctuating orthodoxy, for the emperor was impressionable to arguments of various coteries and became quite lost in theological subtleties. In 314 the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34981" tocid="">Council of Arles</xref> had tried in vain to stop the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="169009" tocid="">Donatist</xref> schism (a nationalistic heretical movement questioning the worthiness of certain church officials) that arose in Africa after Diocletian’s persecutions. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34124" tocid="">Arian</xref> heresy raised even more difficulties: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34795" tocid="">Arius</xref>, an Alexandrian priest and disciple of Lucian of Antioch, questioned the dogma of the Trinity and of the Godhead of Christ, and his asceticism, as well as the sharpness of his dialectics, brought him many followers; he was convicted several times, but the disorders continued. Constantine, solicited by both sides and untroubled by doctrinal nuances that were, moreover, foreign to most believers in the West, wished to institute a universal creed; with this in mind he convened the general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413817" tocid="">Council of Nicaea</xref>, or Nicene Council, in 325. He condemned Arius and declared, in spite of the Easterners, that Jesus was “of one substance” with God the Father. Nevertheless, the heresy continued to exist, for Constantine changed his mind several times; he was influenced by Arian or semi-Arian bishops and was even baptized on his deathbed, in 337, by one of them, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196641" tocid="">Eusebius of Nicomedia</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 325 and 337 Constantine effected important reforms, continuing Diocletian’s work. The division between the <e>limitanei</e> border troops and the tactical troops (<e>comitatenses</e> and imperial guard) led by <e>magistri militum</e> was clarified, and military careers became independent of civil careers. At the same time, however, he lodged an increasing number of troops in or next to cities, a process whose objective was ease and economy of supply; however, training and discipline were harder to enforce because of it, and the men hung about in idleness. It was also under Constantine that a barbarian commander in the Roman army attained a historical significance. He was Crocus the Alaman, who led the movement among the troops that resulted in Constantine’s seizure of the rank of Augustus in 306 immediately after his father Constantius’ death. A similar figure was the great commander Bonitus, a Frank, in the years 316–324; and Constantine credited his victories against Maxentius in 311–312 principally to his barbarian troops, who were honoured on the triumphal <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="133836" tocid="">Arch of Constantine</xref> in Rome. In opposition to him, Licinius mustered drafts of Goths to strengthen his army. Goths were also brought in by Constantine, to the number of 40,000, it is said, to help defend Constantinople in the latter part of his reign, and the palace guard was thenceforward composed mostly of Germans, from among whom a great many high army commands were filled. Dependence on immigrants or first-generation barbarians in war was to increase steadily, at a time when conventional Roman troops were losing military value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Constantine raised many equestrians to senatorial rank, having in his earlier reign the still rapidly increasing ranks of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119404" tocid="">civil service</xref> to fill—it was at least 50 times the size of the civil service under Caracalla—and having in his later reign a second senate to fill, in Constantinople (see below). A rapid inflation in titles of honour also took place. As a result of these several changes, the equestrian order ceased to have meaning, and a new nobility of imperial service developed. Constantine gave first rank in the central administration to the palace quaestor, the <e>magister officiorum</e>, and the counts of finance (<e>comes sacrarum largitionum, comes rei privatae</e>). The diocesan vicars were made responsible to the praetorian prefects, whose number was increased and whose jurisdictions were now vast territories: the prefectures of Gaul, Italy, Illyricum, and the East. The unification of political power brought with it a corresponding decentralization of administration.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to reorganize finances and currency, Constantine minted two new coins: the silver miliarensis and, most importantly, the gold solidus, whose stability was to make it the Byzantine Empire’s basic currency. And by plundering Licinius’ treasury and despoiling the pagan temples, he was able to restore the finances of the state. Even so, he still had to create class taxes: the <e>gleba</e> for senators, and the <e>chrysargyre</e>, which was levied in gold and silver on merchants and craftsmen in the towns.
              </p>
              <p>
                Constantine’s immortality, however, rests on his founding of Constantinople. This “New Rome,” established in 324 on the site of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="296962" tocid="">Byzantium</xref> and dedicated in 330, rapidly increased in population as a result of favours granted to immigrants. A large number of churches were also built there, even though former temples were not destroyed; and the city became the administrative capital of the empire, receiving a senate and proconsul. This choice of site was due not to religious considerations, as has been suggested, but rather to reasons that were both strategic (its proximity to the Danube and Euphrates frontiers) and economic (the importance of the straits and of the junction between the great continental road, which went from Boulogne to the Black Sea, and the eastern commercial routes, passing through Anatolia to Antioch and Alexandria). Constantine died on May 22, 337.

Julian, however, was a magnificent success, a fact that aroused Constantius’ jealousy and led to Julian’s usurpation; for the latter was proclaimed Augustus, in spite of Constantius’ opposition, at Lutetia in 361. Civil war was averted when Constantius died in November 361, leaving the empire to Julian, the last ruler of the Constantinian family.

                At the time of his death in 337 Constantine had been preparing to go to war against the Persians. This legacy weighed heavily on the shoulders of Constantius, a military incompetent when compared to the energetic Sāsānian king Shāpūr II. Nearly every year the Persians attacked and pillaged Roman territory; the Mesopotamian towns were besieged, and Nisibis alone resisted. There was a lull between 350 and 357, while Shāpūr was detained by troubles in the eastern regions of his own kingdom. The war resumed, however, and Mesopotamia was partly lost when the emperor had to leave in order to fight Julian. Constantius had fought Shāpūr conscientiously, but his generals were mediocre, except for Urisicinus, and he himself was clumsy. In the meantime, the Rhine and Danube were threatened frequently, because the troops had been withdrawn from there and sent to the East. Constantius, moreover, had made a mistake in sending Chnodomar, the Alemannic king, against Magnentius in 351, for his tribes had gone on to ravage Gaul. Julian, however, soon revealed himself to be a great military leader by winning several well-fought campaigns between 356 and 361, most notably at Strasbourg in 357, and by restoring approximately 70 plundered villages. His abandonment, in <e ty="s">ad</e> 358, of the district of Toxandria, roughly equivalent to modern Belgium, to its barbarian squatters, on condition of their defending it against other invaders, was no doubt a realistic decision. Constantius defeated the Quadi and the Goths on the Danube in 359, but court intrigues, Magnentius’ usurpation, and the interminable war against the Persians allowed the barbarians to wreak great havoc.

              <p>
                Constantius was primarily interested in religious affairs. His interventions created a “caesaro-papism” that was unfavourable to the church, for after the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="398349" tocid="">Battle of Mursa</xref> the emperor had become violently Arian. The Christological problem had moved to the forefront. In 360 Constantius obtained a new creed by force from the Council of Constantinople, which, rejecting the notion of “substance” as too risky, declared only that the Son was like the Father and thus left the problem unresolved. Pagans as well as orthodox Nicaeans (Homoousians) and extremist Arians (Anomoeans) were persecuted, for in 356–357 several edicts proscribed magic, divination, and sacrifices and ordered that the temples be closed. But when Constantius visited Rome in 357, he was so struck by its pagan grandeur that he apparently suspended the application of these measures.

              <headtitle>The reign of Julian</headtitle>
              <p>
                Julian, who had been spared because of his tender age from the family butchering in 337, had been brought up far from the court and was undoubtedly intended for the priesthood. Nevertheless, he had been allowed to take courses in rhetoric and philosophy at Ephesus and later at Athens; he developed a fondness for Hellenic literature, and he secretly apostatized around 351. When he became sole emperor at the end of 361, he proclaimed his pagan faith, ordered the restitution of the temples seized under Constantius, and freed all the bishops who had been banished by the Arians, so as to weaken Christianity through the resumption of doctrinal disputes. The religion he himself espoused was compounded of traditional non-Christian elements of piety and theology, such as might have been found in any fairly intellectual person in the preceding centuries, along with elements of Neoplatonism developed by Porphyry and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="280453" tocid="">Iamblichus</xref> of two or three generations earlier, and, finally, much of the organization and social ethic of the church. From Neoplatonism he learned the techniques of direct communication with the gods (theurgy) through prayer and invocation; from the church he adopted, as the church itself had adopted from the empire’s civil organization, a hierarchy of powers: provincial, metropolitan, urban, with himself as supreme pontiff. His deep love of traditional higher culture, moreover, provoked his war on Christian intellectuals and teachers who, he protested, had no right to Homer or Plato. Many Christians both before and later concurred with him, being themselves troubled by the relation between Christianity and inherited literature and thought, steeped as both were in pagan beliefs.
              </p>
              <p>In the latter part of his 18-month reign, Julian forbade Christians from teaching, began the rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem, restored many pagan shrines, and displayed an exaggerated piety. Whereas Constantine (and his sons to a lesser degree) had introduced a huge number of coreligionists into the upper ranks of the army and government, achieving a rough parity between the members of the two religions, Julian began to reverse the process. Within a short while Julian was successful enough in his undertaking to have aroused the fear and hatred of the Christians, who for a long time thought of him as the Antichrist.</p>
              <p>
                In the political realm, Julian wished to return to the liberal principate of the Antonines—to a time before the reforms of Diocletian and Constantine, whom he detested. He put an end to the terrorism of Constantius’ eunuchs and <e>agentes in rebus</e> and reduced the personnel and expenditures of the court, while he himself lived like an ascetic. In the provinces he lightened the financial burden on individuals by reducing the <e>capitatio</e>, and on cities, by reducing the <e>aurum coronarium</e> and restoring the municipal properties confiscated by Constantius. On the other hand, he increased the number of curiales by reinstating numerous clerks in an attempt to return the ancient lustre to municipal life. Thus, he earned the gratitude of pagan intellectuals, who were enamoured of the past of free Greece; and Ammianus made him the central hero of his history.
              </p>
              <p>Taking up Trajan’s dream, Julian wished to defeat Persia definitively by engaging the empire’s forces in an offensive war that would facilitate a national reconciliation around the gods of paganism. But his army was weak—corrupted perhaps by large numbers of hostile Christians. After a brilliant beginning, he was defeated near Ctesiphon and had to retrace his steps painfully; he was killed in an obscure encounter on June 26, 363.</p>
              <p>
                Julian’s successor, Jovian, chosen by the army’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="228621" tocid="">general staff</xref>, was a Christian, but not a fanatic. He negotiated a peace with Shāpūr, by which Rome lost a good part of Galerian’s conquests of 298 (including <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422748" tocid="">Nisibis</xref>, which had not surrendered) and abandoned Armenia. He also restored tolerance in religious affairs, for he neither espoused any of the heresies nor persecuted pagans. In February 364 he died accidentally.

              <p>
                Once again the general staff unanimously chose a Pannonian officer—Valentinian, an energetic patriot and, like Jovian, a moderate Christian—but he had to yield to the rivalry of the armies by dividing authority. Taking the West for himself, Valentinian entrusted the East to his brother <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="622002" tocid="">Valens</xref>, an inexperienced man whom he raised to the rank of Augustus. For the first time the two parts of the empire were truly separate, except for the selection of consuls, in which Valentinian had precedence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although he served the state with dedication, Valentinian could be brutal, choleric, and authoritarian. His <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="213380" tocid="">foreign policy</xref> was excellent: all the while he was fighting barbarians (the Alemanni in Gaul, the Sarmatians and Quadi in Pannonia) and putting down revolts in Britain and Africa (notably that of the Berber Firmus) with the aid of his top general, Theodosius the Elder, he was taking care to improve the army’s equipment and to protect Gaul by creating a brilliant fortification. His domestic measures favoured the curiales and the lower classes: from then on, taxes would be collected exclusively by officials; the protection of the poor was entrusted to “defenders of the plebs,” chosen from among retired high officials (<e>honorati</e>). Nevertheless, needs of state obliged him to accentuate social immobility, to reinforce corporation discipline and official hierarchization, and to demand taxes ruthlessly. At first he was benevolent to the Senate of Rome, supervised the provisioning of the city, and legislated in favour of its university, the nursery of officials (law of 370). But beginning in 369, under the influence of Maximin, the prefect of Gaul, he initiated a period of terror, which struck the great senatorial families. Meanwhile, religious peace reigned in the West, tolerance was proclaimed, and after some difficulty, Rome found a great pope in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="150483" tocid="">Damasus</xref>, who, beginning in 373, actively supported the new bishop of Milan, St. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">Ambrose</xref>, an ardent defender of orthodoxy.
              </p>
              <p>In the East, Valens, who was incapable and suspicious, had fallen under the influence of legists, such as the praetorian prefect Modestus. The beginning of Valens’ reign was shadowed by the attempted usurpation of Procopius (365–366), a pagan relative of Julian’s who failed and was killed by the army, which remained faithful to Valens. Modestus instituted harsh persecutions in Antioch of the educated pagan elite. Valens was a fanatic Arian, who exiled even moderate Nicaean bishops and granted to Arians favours that aroused violent reactions from the orthodox, whose power had increased in the East. Valens’ policies made the East prey to violent religious passions.</p>
              <p>
                On the Danube, Valens fought the Visigoths and made a treaty with their king, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40582" tocid="">Athanaric</xref>, in 369; but in 375 the Ostrogoths and the Greutingi appeared on the frontiers, pushed from their home in southern Russia by the powerful <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="276414" tocid="">Huns</xref>. In 376 Valens authorized the starving masses to enter Thrace; but, being exploited and mistreated by the officials, they soon turned to uncontrollable pillaging. Their numbers continually increased by the addition of new bands, until finally they threatened Constantinople itself. Valens sent for aid from the West, but without waiting for it to arrive he joined battle and was killed in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6534" tocid="">Adrianople disaster of</xref> 378, which to some critics foreshadowed the approaching fall of the Roman Empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Goths, who were also stirring up Thrace and Macedonia, could no longer be driven out. The provinces subject to their pillaging soon included Pannonia farther up the Danube, where Gratian agreed with a cluster of three tribal armies to settle them as a unit under their own chiefs on vacant lands (380). By a far more significant arrangement of the same sort two years later, Theodosius assigned to the Goths a large area of Thrace along the Danube as, in effect, their own kingdom; there they enjoyed autonomy as well as a handsome subsidy from the emperor, exactly as tribes beyond the empire had done in previous treaties. They were expected to respond to calls on their manpower if the Roman army needed supplementing, as it routinely did. Although the Goths considered this treaty ended with Theodosius’ death and resumed their lawless wanderings for a while, it nevertheless represented the model for subsequent ones, again struck with the Goths under their king <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="12218" tocid="">Alaric</xref> (from 395; see below) and with later barbarian tribes. The capture of the empire had begun.

              <p>
                Following Valentinian’s sudden death in 375, the West was governed by his son Gratian, then 16 years old, who had been given the title of Augustus as early as 367. The Pannonian army, rife with intrigue, quickly proclaimed Gratian’s half-brother, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="622041" tocid="">Valentinian II</xref>, only four years old. The latter received Illyricum under his older brother’s guardianship, and this arrangement satisfied everybody. Valentinian’s advisers were executed: Maximian was sacrificed to the spite of the Senate, and Theodosius the Elder became the victim of personal jealousies. Gratian announced a liberal principate, supported in Gaul by the wealthy family of the Bordeaux poet <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43540" tocid="">Ausonius</xref> and in Rome by the Symmachi and the Nicomachi Flaviani, representatives of the pagan aristocracy. His generals defeated the Alemanni and the Goths on the Danube but arrived too late to save Valens.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Jan. 19, 379, before the army, Gratian proclaimed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590747" tocid="">Theodosius</xref>, the son of the recently executed general, as Eastern emperor. Theodosius was chosen for his military ability and for his orthodoxy (Gratian, extremely pious, had come under the influence of Damasus and Ambrose). The East was enlarged by the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, taken from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="622041" tocid="">Valentinian II</xref>. Gratian and Theodosius agreed to admit the Goths into the empire, and Gratian applied the policy also to the Salian Franks in Germany. Theodosius soon dominated his weak colleague and entered the battle for the triumph of orthodoxy. In 380 the Arians were relieved of their churches in Constantinople, and in 381 the Nicaean faith was universally imposed by a council whose canons established the authority of the metropolitan bishops over their dioceses and gave the bishop of the capital a primacy similar to that of the bishop of Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                In ecclesiastical affairs, the separation between East and West was codified. The Westerners bowed to this policy, satisfied with the triumph of orthodoxy. Gratian then permitted Ambrose and Damasus to deal harshly with the Arians, with the support of the state. Paganism also was hounded: following Theodosius’ lead, Gratian refused the chief priesthood, removed the altar of Victory from the hall of the Roman Senate, and deprived the pagan priests and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626935" tocid="">Vestal Virgins</xref> of their subsidies and privileges. The pagan senators were outraged, but their protests were futile because Gratian was watched over by Ambrose.
              </p>
              <p>
                This militantly orthodox policy aroused the displeasure of the pagans and of the Western Arians: thus, when Gratian left Trier for Milan, the army of Gaul and Britain proclaimed its leader, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370586" tocid="">Maximus</xref>, in 383. He conquered Gaul without difficulty, and Gratian was killed in Lyons. Maximus, who, like Theodosius, was Spanish and extremely orthodox, was recognized by the latter. In the meantime, the third Augustus, Valentinian II, had taken refuge in Milan after suffering defeat in Pannonia. He was effectively under the domination of his mother, Justina, an Arian who sought support for her son among the Arians and pagans of Rome and even among the African <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="169009" tocid="">Donatists</xref> (a Christian heresy). In 388 Maximus, after arriving in Italy, first expelled Valentinian and then prepared to attack Theodosius. The latter, accepting the inevitability of war, strengthened his resolve and gained several victories. Maximus was killed at Aquileia in 388, and thenceforth Theodosius ruled both West and East; he was represented in the East by his son <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32473" tocid="">Arcadius</xref>, an Augustus since 383. Valentinian II was sent to Trier, accompanied by the Frankish general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32333" tocid="">Arbogast</xref> to control him.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a few years’ respite, during the prefectureships of Nicomachus Flavianus in Rome and Tatian in the East, paganism waged its last fight: Theodosius, influenced by Ambrose, who had dared to inflict public penance on him in 390 after the massacre at Thessalonica, had determined to eliminate the pagans completely. After a few hostile clashes, the law of Nov. 8, 392, proscribed the pagan religion. Then <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32333" tocid="">Arbogast</xref>, after Valentinian II’s death in 392 under shadowy circumstances, proclaimed as emperor the rhetorician Eugenius. When Theodosius refused to recognize him, Eugenius was thrown into the arms of the pagans of Rome. But this last “pagan reaction” was short-lived; in 394, with his victory at the Frigidus (modern Vipacco) River, between Aquileia and Emona, Theodosius put an end to the hopes of Eugenius and his followers. His intention was to place his son Honorius, proclaimed Augustus in 393, over the West, while returning his eldest son, Arcadius, to the East. But Theodosius’ sudden death in January 395 precipitated the division of the empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Theodosius had successfully dealt with the danger of the Goths, although not without taking risks, and had both established a dynasty and imposed the strictest orthodoxy. A compromise peace with the Persians had given Rome, in 387, a small section of Armenia, where he had founded Theodosiopolis (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="192184" tocid="">Erzurum</xref>). He had survived two pretenders in the West. These military successes were, however, won with armies in which barbarians were in the majority, which was not a good sign.

              <headtitle>Social and economic conditions</headtitle>
              <p>During the 4th century the emperor’s power was theoretically absolute, the traditions of the principate having given way to the necessities of defense.</p>
              <p>
                The emperor was both heir to the Hellenistic <e>basileus</e> (absolute king) and the anointed of the deity. Pagans and Christians alike considered him “emperor by the grace of God,” which, strictly speaking, rendered the imperial cult unnecessary. Indeed, he hardly needed the ceremonies and parade of god-awfulness with which Diocletian and his successors were surrounded. Yet imperial authority had actually lost much of its effectiveness due to the growth and nature of late Roman government. Its ranks can be estimated at more than 30,000 men—perhaps an insignificant number compared with that of modern governments but gigantic when set against the total of only a few hundred a century earlier. The problem, however, lay not in numbers but in the assumption, held throughout both bureaucracy and army, that a position of power ex officio entitled the holder to a rake-off of some sort, to be extracted both from the citizenry with whom he came in contact and from fellow members of the service in ranks below his own. This ethos was not new; but during the principate it had been restrained by higher officers and officials, who operated according to a different, essentially aristocratic, code expressed in patron-dependent relations and mutuality. Its currency was not money but favours and services. Such a code was swept away by the rapid increase in the size of government in the later 3rd century and the rise to high civil and military posts by men recruited from the ranks rather than from the upper classes. As they had bought their own promotions or appointments, so they expected to recoup their expenses (and more besides) by such means as selling exemptions and extortion. The more intrusive and demanding the military tax collection or the state’s control of the rosters of city senates, the more profit there was for a pervasively corrupt administration. Persons close to the emperor could, for a price, generally screen him from knowledge of what was going on. Constantine, for example, complained quite in vain—and the complaint was endlessly repeated by his successors—that the city senates were being “emptied of persons obligated to them by birth, who yet are asking for a government post by petition to the emperor, running off to the legions or various civil offices.” Such posts could easily be bought. A great deal of imperial planning was thus vitiated by sale. Many of the profiteers started life in the urban upper classes, but, as nouveaux riches, they joined the older landed nobility after a term in the emperor’s service.
              </p>
              <p>In a few areas where measurement is possible, one can see that a process of consolidation of landownership had been going on for a long time, bringing the rural population increasingly into dependence on the larger property holders. Diocletian’s new system of property assessment accelerated this process; it was more thorough and thus exposed the poor and ignorant to exploitation by local officialdom. In response, they sought the protection of some influential man to ward off unfair assessments, selling their land to him and becoming his tenants. In areas disturbed by lawlessness, a large landowner offered them safety as well. The strength of rural magnates in their formidable, even fortified, dwellings, with a dependent peasantry of 100 or even 1,000 around them made much trouble for tax collectors, and landowners thus became the target of many laws. Consolidation of ownership, however, was not apparent in northern Africa, and the reverse process has been established for a carefully researched area of Syria.</p>
              <p>
                Regional differences cannot be disregarded. They were responsible for guiding the development of the later empire along quite varied paths. The archaeological data, which reflect these developments most clearly, register such changes as the degree of wealth in public buildings and the use and elegance of carved sarcophagi or of mosaics in private houses. Broadly speaking, a decline is noticeable throughout the European provinces; it tends to affect the cities earlier than the rural areas and is detectable sometimes by 350, generally by 375. In the Danube provinces, the evidence fits neatly with political history following the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6534" tocid="">Battle of Adrianople</xref> in 378, after which their condition was continually disturbed by the Visigothic immigrants. There is, however, no such obvious explanation for areas such as Spain or central Gaul. Italy of the 3rd and 4th centuries was not perceptibly worse off than before, though wealth in the Po region was more concentrated in the cities north of the river. Northern Africa seems to have maintained nearly the same level of prosperity as in earlier centuries, if proper weight is given to ecclesiastical building after Constantine. For Egypt, no clear picture emerges; but all the other Eastern provinces enjoyed in the later empire the same level of economic well-being as before or a still higher one, with more disposable wealth and an increasing population. These conditions continued into the 5th century.
              </p>
              <p>The vast differences between the European and the Eastern provinces are best explained by the shifting focus of imperial energies. It can be traced in the locus of heaviest military recruitment, in the lower Danube, as the 3rd century progressed; in the consequent concentration of military expenditure there; and in the siting of the emperors’ residence as it was moved from Rome to Milan in the 260s, then to the lower Danube later in the 3rd century (where much fighting occurred), and subsequently to Nicomedia (Diocletian’s capital). None of the Tetrarchs chose Rome—its days as the imperial centre were over—and when, from among various Eastern cities he considered, Constantine decided on Byzantium as his permanent residence, he simply made permanent a very long-term development. Meanwhile the Rhine frontier and the upper Danube were repeatedly overrun. As can be inferred from the signs of fortification in Pannonia, Gaul, Britain, and Spain, internal policing was neglected. Commercial intercourse, which had been the key to raising the economy and the level of urbanization, became less safe and easy. Villas turned into self-sufficient villages, and the smaller towns also reverted to villages. Only the larger towns, such as Bordeaux, Arles, or Cartagena, maintained their vitality.</p>
              <p>
                Although there was considerable inflation (culminating under Theodosius), in spite of a deflationary <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="208363" tocid="">fiscal policy</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127986" tocid="">commercial transactions</xref> ignored <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="54263" tocid="">barter</xref> and were based instead on currency throughout the empire at the end of the century. The economy was partially under state direction, which was applied to agriculture through bias toward the settler system on imperial estates and to industry through the requisitioning of corporations (artisans, merchants, carriers) and the creation of state workshops (especially for manufacturing military goods). Opinions differ on the intensity of trade, but there was certainly clear progress in comparison to the 3rd century.

Efforts by the church to reach them were intermittent and lacked energy. Bishops generally expected rural magnates to do their job for them; and the church leadership was, in any case, of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="550940" tocid="">social class</xref> that viewed the peasantry from a great distance and wanted to keep it that way. Except by such unusual figures as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="366997" tocid="">Martin of Tours</xref> or Marcellus of Apamea, little effort was made to convert people who were hard to reach. As always in antiquity, it was in the cities where changes occurred—with the exception of monasticism.

                Only in the reign of Constantine, and about simultaneously in Egypt and Palestine, had monasticism, a religious movement whose followers lived as hermits and pursued a life of extreme asceticism, become more than the little-regarded choice of rare zealots. Near Gaza and in the desert along the eastern side of Jerusalem a number of tiny clusters of cells had been made from caves and taken as residence by ascetics, from whose fame and example that way of life later spread to many other corners of the Levant. The bishop of Jerusalem, Cyril, by mid-century could speak of “regiments of monks.” But it was in the desert on both sides of the Nile that similar ascetic experiments of much greater importance were made, by the hero of the movement, St. Anthony, and others. True monasticism, tempered only by weekly communal worship and organizing, established itself on Anthony’s model and under his inspiration in the first decade of the 4th century; it took root above all in the desert of Scete just west of the base of the Nile delta. Coenobitism, joint life in enclosed communities, was the model preferred by St. Pachomius around 330, vigorously directed and diffused by him until mid-century, when both he and Anthony died. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">Basil of Caesarea</xref> was to establish monastic communities in Cappadocia under the influence of what he saw in Egypt on his visit there in the year of Anthony’s death; and Athanasius was shortly to write a biography of that saint of enormous influence and to carry word of his life to Italy and Gaul during his own exile there. The biography was soon translated into Latin and inspired a scattering of experiments in asceticism or coenobitism in the West—in Vercellae in Italy, for example, by 330, and at Tours in the 370s under Martin’s direction. Tours became the first monastery in the West comparable to those in the East, but development subsequently was slow compared to the 10,000 or more monasteries founded in Egypt by <e ty="s">ad</e> 400.

              <p>
                The most distinct and well-reported phenomenon during the century after the conversion of Constantine was the continued religious rioting and harrying in the cities, both in all the major ones and in dozens of minor ones. The death toll exceeded the toll among Christians at the hands of pagans in earlier persecutions. It was rarely of Jews or pagans at the hands of Christians or of Christians at the hands of pagans, but ordinarily of Christians at each others’ hands in the course of sectarian strife. For a time, no one sect enjoyed a majority among Homoousians, Arians, Donatists, Meletians, and many others. Bishoprics were fiercely contested and appeals often made to armed coercion. The emperors had assumed the right to interfere and often did so; but under Theodosius, Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="150483" tocid="">Damasus</xref> and St. Ambrose reacted: the state was to restrict itself to furnishing the “secular arm,” while the church, in the name of evangelical ethics, claimed the right to judge the emperors, a policy that had grave implications for the future. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="88250" tocid="">“caesaro-papism” </xref>of Constantius later gained adherents under the Byzantine emperors. In the meantime, the Goths had been converted to Arianism by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="613200" tocid="">Ulfilas</xref> during the period of Constantius and Valens, thus presaging conflicts that were to come after the great invasions. Orthodox missionaries had converted Osroëne, Armenia, and even some countries on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="494479" tocid="">Red Sea</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Christian literature of the 4th century is remarkable. Its first representative is <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196614" tocid="">Eusebius of Caesarea</xref>, a friend and panegyrist of Constantine and a church historian whose creation of a “political theology” sealed the union between the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115240" tocid="">Christian</xref> emperor and the church. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">St. Athanasius</xref> wrote apologetic works and a life of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="27407" tocid="">St. Anthony</xref>. Also prominent were the great Cappadocians: St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, St. Gregory of Nyssa, and St. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="116479" tocid="">John Chrysostom</xref> of Antioch, the greatest preacher of his time. The Westerners, too, had great scholars and brilliant writers: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="265691" tocid="">St. Hilary of Poitiers</xref>, enemy of the Arians and of Constantius; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">St. Ambrose</xref>, administrator and pastor, whose excessive authority was imposed on Gratian and even on Theodosius; and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302749" tocid="">St. Jerome</xref>, a desert monk and confessor of upper-class Roman ladies, a formidable polemicist who knew Greek and Hebrew and made the first faithful translation of the Old and New Testaments (the Vulgate) as well as of a chronicle of world history, which was a translation and continuation of the work of Eusebius. Finally,<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid=""> St. Augustine</xref>, the bishop of Hippo, was a great pastor, a vigorous controversialist, a sensitive and passionate writer (the <e>Confessions</e>), and the powerful theologian of <e>The City of God</e>. The century that developed these great minds cannot be considered decadent.

                </thumbasm>After the death of Theodosius the Western empire was governed by young Honorius. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="566280" tocid="">Stilicho</xref>, an experienced statesman and general, was charged with assisting him and maintaining unity with the East, which had been entrusted to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32473" tocid="">Arcadius</xref>. The Eastern leaders soon rejected Stilicho’s tutelage. An antibarbarian reaction had developed in Constantinople, which impeded the objectives of the half-Vandal Stilicho. He wanted to intervene on several occasions in the internal affairs at Constantinople but was prevented from doing so by a threat from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="630568" tocid="">Visigoth</xref> chieftain <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="12218" tocid="">Alaric</xref>, whom he checked at Pollentia in 402, then by the Ostrogoth Radagaisus’ raid in 406, and finally by the great invasion of the Gauls in 407. The following year he hoped to restore unity by installing a new emperor in Constantinople, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590767" tocid="">Theodosius II</xref>, the son of Arcadius, who had died prematurely; but he succumbed to a political and military plot in August 408. The division of the two <e>partes imperii</e> was now a permanent one.

                Honorius, seated in Ravenna, a city easier to defend than Milan, had only incompetent courtiers surrounding him, themselves animated by a violent hatred of the barbarians. Alaric soon reappeared, at the head of his Visigoths, demanding land and money. Tired of the Romans’ double-dealing, he descended on Rome itself. The city was taken and pillaged for three days, thus putting an end to an era of Western history (August 410). An Arian, Alaric spared the churches. He died shortly thereafter in the south; his successor, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40445" tocid="">Athaulf</xref>, left the peninsula to march against the Gauls.

Between 409 and 415 a great many of these barbarians arrived in Spain and settled in Lusitania (Suebi) and in Baetica (Vandals, whence the name Andalusia). As soon as Gaul had become slightly more peaceful, Athaulf’s Visigoths arrived, establishing themselves in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="403437" tocid="">Narbonensis</xref> and Aquitania. After recognizing them as “federates,” Honorius asked them to go to Spain to fight the Vandals. Meanwhile, the Roman general Constantius eliminated several usurpers in Gaul, confined the Goths in Aquitania, and reorganized the administration (the Gallic assembly of 418). But he was unable to expel the Franks, the Alemanni, and the Burgundians, who had occupied the northern part of the country, nor to eliminate the brigandage of the Bagaudae. He was associated with the empire and was proclaimed Augustus in 421, but he died shortly afterward. His son, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="622048" tocid="">Valentinian III</xref>, succeeded Honorius in 423 and reigned until 455.

                During the first half of the 5th century the barbarians gradually installed themselves, in spite of the efforts of the Roman general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="7628" tocid="">Aetius</xref> at the head of a small army of mercenaries and of Huns.

                In 428 the Vandal <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223565" tocid="">Gaiseric</xref> led his people (80,000 persons, including 15,000 warriors) to Africa. St. Augustine died in 430 in besieged Hippo, Carthage fell in 435, and in 442 a treaty gave Gaiseric the rich provinces of Byzacena and Numidia. From there he was able to starve Rome, threaten Sicily, and close off the western basin of the Mediterranean to the Byzantines.

                Shortly afterward, in 450, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42236" tocid="">Attila’s</xref> Huns invaded the West—first Gaul, where, after having been kept out of Paris, they were defeated by Aetius on the Campus Mauriacus (near Troyes), then Italy, which they evacuated soon after having received tribute from the pope, St. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336187" tocid="">Leo</xref>. Attila died shortly afterward; and this invasion, which indeed left more legendary memories than actual ruins, had shown that a solidarity had been created between the Gallo-Romans and their barbarian occupiers, for the Franks, the Alemanni, and even Theodoric’s Visigoths had come to Aetius’ aid.

              <headtitle>Barbarian kingdoms</headtitle>
              <p>
                Several barbarian kingdoms were then set up: in Africa, Gaiseric’s kingdom of the Vandals; in Spain and in Gaul as far as the Loire, the Visigothic kingdom; and farther to the north, the kingdoms of the Salian Franks and the Alemanni. The barbarians were everywhere a small minority. They established themselves on the great estates and divided the land to the benefit of the federates without doing much harm to the lower classes or disturbing the economy. The old inhabitants lived under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref>, while the barbarians kept their own “personality of laws,” of which the best-known is the judicial composition, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="639839" tocid="">Wergild</xref>. Romans and barbarians coexisted but uneasily. Among the obstacles to reconciliation were differences in mores; social and political institutions (personal monarchies, fidelity of man to man); language, although Latin was still used in administration; and above all religion: the Arianism of the barbarians permitted the Roman Catholic bishops to retain their hold over their flocks. The only persecution, however, was under the Vandals, whose domination was the harshest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two great kingdoms marked the end of the 5th century. In Gaul, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="122446" tocid="">Clovis</xref>, the king of the Salian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="217113" tocid="">Franks</xref> (reigned 481/482–511), expelled Syagrius, the last Roman, from Soissons, took Alsace and the Palatinate from the Alemanni (496), and killed <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="12225" tocid="">Alaric II</xref>, king of the Visigoths, at Vouillé (507). His conversion to Catholicism assured him the support of the bishops, and Frankish domination was established in Gaul. At the same time, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590679" tocid="">Theodoric</xref>, king of the Ostrogoths, reigned in Italy. He had been charged by the emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="656509" tocid="">Zeno</xref> to take back Italy from Odoacer in 488, and in 494 he had himself proclaimed king at Ravenna. His Goths, few in number, were established in the north; elsewhere he preserved the old imperial administration, with senators as prefects. Externally, he kept Clovis from reaching the Mediterranean and extended his state up to the valley of the Rhône. Theodoric died in 526. Ten years later <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308858" tocid="">Justinian</xref> charged his general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="59479" tocid="">Belisarius</xref> with the reconquest of Italy, a costly, devastating, and temporary operation that lasted from 535 to 540.

              <headtitle>Analysis of the decline and fall</headtitle>
              <p>The causes of the fall of the empire have been sought in a great many directions and with a great deal of interest, even urgency, among historians of the West; for it has been natural for them to see or seek parallels between Rome’s fate and that of their own times. In any choice of explanations there is likely to be a hidden sense of priorities determining the definition of “civilization,” or specifically the civilization of “Rome” or of “the classical world.” If, for example, classical civilization is identified with the literature of the ancients at what one conceives to be its best, then “the end” of this civilization has to be set at some point of decline and explanations for its coming to be sought in the preexisting conditions; or if not on literature but on political domination, then some other point in time must be chosen and explained in terms of what seems to have led up to it. There have been endless variations on this search, and there will continue to be more, no doubt, since it is agreed that literature did, in fact, diminish in quality, as did jurisprudence, although at a different date, and oratory, and vigorous political debate in the capital, and powerfully innovative philosophy, and sculpture, and civic patriotism, and the willingness to die for one’s country. “Civilization” turns out to be not one single entity but a web of many strands, each of its own length.</p>
              <p>
                Perhaps the view attracting the most adherents, however, has focused on the ability of the empire to maintain its political and military integrity—that being the strand apparently most central and significant—and the juncture at which that ability is most dramatically challenged and found wanting—the period of “the barbarian invasions,” meaning 407 and roughly the ensuing decade. If this juncture in turn is examined and the antecedents of the empire’s weakness sought in internal developments, they can only be found in the government. Belief in and obedience to the monarch was not lacking, nor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="382397" tocid="">military technology</xref> at least matching that of the invaders, nor a population large enough to field a large force, nor the force itself (on paper, at least), nor the economic potential adequate to the arming of it. Particular defeats described by contemporaries in reasonable detail are almost uniformly attributable to the rottenness of government as described above, rendering soldiers undisciplined, untrained, frequently on indefinite leave, and without good morale or proper equipment. Soldiers were unpaid because of various abuses in the collection and delivery of supplies and money from taxpayers, and they were distracted from their proper duties by their own and their officers’ extortionate habits in contact with their civilian hosts. For the same basic reason—that is, abuse of power wielded through service in the army or bureaucracy—the administration of the cities no longer enjoyed the efforts of the urban elites, who by 407 had long since fled from active service to some exempt government post or title. For the same reason, finally, corrective measures needed against these systemic weaknesses could not be developed by enlightened men at the centre because they were screened from the truth of things, were at the mercy of incompetent or venal agents, or were unable to maintain themselves in power against the plotters around them. The details of all these charges that can be made against late Roman government are writ large in the great collection of imperial edicts published in 438, the Theodosian Code, as well as in the works of roughly contemporary writers from East and West, such as Synesius, Augustine, Libanius, Themistius, Chrysostom, Symmachus, Bishop Maximus of Turin, and, above all, Ammianus Marcellinus. An empire that could not deliver to a point of need all the defensive force it still possessed could not well stand against the enemy outside.

              <e ty="s">Colin Wells</e>, <e>The Roman Empire</e> (1984), is an intelligent short history up through the Severi. The history is carried further by <e ty="s">Michael Grant</e>, <e>The Climax of Rome: The Final Achievements of the Ancient World, A.D. 161–337</e> (1968). <e ty="s">Donald Earl</e>, <e>The Age of Augustus</e> (1968, reissued 1980), is useful in providing a little more depth. As to governmental institutions, <e ty="s">Fergus Millar</e>, <e>The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC–AD 337</e> (1977), offers a monumentally detailed study of the ruler in his capacity as civil governor up through Constantine; and <e ty="s">Richard J.A. Talbert</e>, <e>The Senate of Imperial Rome</e> (1984), describes the role and actions of the ruler’s partner. On provincial government, as well as much else, <e ty="s">Fergus Millar</e> (ed.), <e>The Roman Empire and Its Neighbours</e>, 2nd ed. (1981; originally published in German, 1966), is informative and readable. Commentary on the economy is supplied by <e ty="s">Kevin Greene</e>, <e>The Archaeology of the Roman Economy</e> (1986). <e ty="s">Géza Alföldy</e>, <e>The Social History of Rome</e> (1985), on the structure of society; and <e ty="s">Ramsay MacMullen</e>, <e ty="i">Roman Social Relations, 50 B.C. to A.D. 284</e> (1974), on the feelings uniting or dividing groups or strata, are complementary works. Provincial history broadly interpreted may be sampled in <e ty="s">Sheppard Frere</e>, <e>Britannia: A History of Roman Britain</e>, 3rd ed. rev. (1987); <e ty="s">Paul MacKendrick</e>, <e>The North African Stones Speak</e> (1980); and <e ty="s">A.H.M. Jones</e>, <e>The Greek City from Alexander to Justinian</e> (1940, reissued 1979), still useful, since archaeology has little touched the eastern end of the Mediterranean world. <e ty="s">Bernard Andreae</e>, <e>The Art of Rome</e> (1977; originally published in German, 1973), a large, luxuriously illustrated work with an equally rich scholarly text; and <e ty="s">Niels Hannestad</e>, <e ty="i">Roman Art and Imperial Policy</e> (1986; originally published in Danish, 1976), deal with their material in quite different ways: the former is conventionally art-historical, the latter uses his material to illuminate its context. Architecture is best approached through <e ty="s">W.L. MacDonald</e>, <e>The Architecture of the Roman Empire</e>, rev. ed., 2 vol. (1982–86), a well-written, imaginative account; and through such specialized studies as <e ty="s">John Percival</e>, <e>The Roman Villa: An Historical Introduction</e> (1976, reissued 1988). <e ty="s">Philippe Ariès</e> and <e ty="s">Georges Duby</e> (eds.), <e>A History of Private Life</e>, vol. 1, <e>From Pagan Rome to Byzantium</e>, ed. by <e ty="s">Paul Veyne</e> (1987; originally published in French, 1985), is a social history in an old-fashioned sense by a master of the most up-to-date approaches. The importance of emperor worship is well argued in the detailed work by <e ty="s">Duncan Fishwick</e>, <e>The Imperial Cult in the Latin West</e>, vol. 1 in 2 vol. (1987); and, with more interpretation and for the other half of the empire, by <e ty="s">S.R.F. Price</e>, <e>Rituals and Power: The Roman Imperial Cult in Asia Minor</e> (1984). <e ty="s">Ramsay MacMullen</e>, <e>Paganism in the Roman Empire</e> (1981), provides a comprehensive view. Military history is made accessible through <e ty="s">G.R. Watson</e>, <e>The Roman Soldier</e> (1969, reissued 1985). An explication of a major aspect of culture may be found in the latter half of a work by a notable historian, <e ty="s">H.I. Marrou</e>, <e>A History of Education in Antiquity</e> (1956, reprinted 1982; originally published in French, 1948). <e ty="s">Albin Lesky</e>, <e>A History of Greek Literature</e> (1966; originally published in German, 2nd ed., 1963), may be paired with <e ty="s">H.J. Rose</e>, <e>A Handbook of Latin Literature, from the Earliest Times to the Death of St. Augustine</e>, 3rd ed. (1966); and with the more elegant study by <e ty="s">Gordon Williams</e>, <e>Change and Decline: Roman Literature in the Early Empire</e> (1978). On the church, <e ty="s">W.H.C. Frend</e>, <e>The Rise of Christianity</e> (1984), is readable and comprehensive up through the 6th century.

            <headtitle>The essence and identity of Christianity</headtitle>
            <p>
              At the very least, Christianity is the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="200515" tocid="">faith</xref> tradition that focuses on the figure of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. In this context, faith refers both to the believers’ act of trust and to the content of their faith. As a tradition, Christianity is more than a system of religious belief. It also has generated a culture, a set of ideas and ways of life, practices, and artifacts that have been handed down from generation to generation since Jesus first became the object of faith. Christianity is thus both a living tradition of faith and the culture that the faith leaves behind. The agent of Christianity is the church, the community of people who make up the body of believers.
            </p>
            <p>To say that Christianity “focuses” on Jesus Christ is to say that somehow it brings together its beliefs and practices and other traditions in reference to a historic figure. Few Christians, however, would be content to keep this reference merely historical. Although their faith tradition is historical—i.e., they believe that transactions with the divine do not occur in the realm of timeless ideas but among ordinary humans through the ages—the vast majority of Christians focus their faith in Jesus Christ as someone who is also a present reality. They may include many other references in their tradition and thus may speak of “God” and “human nature” or of “church” and “world,” but they would not be called Christian if they did not bring their attentions first and last to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
              While there is something simple about this focus on Jesus as the central figure, there is also something very complicated. That complexity is revealed by the thousands of separate churches, sects, and denominations that make up the modern Christian tradition. To project these separate bodies against the background of their development in the nations of the world is to suggest the bewildering variety. To picture people expressing their adherence to that tradition in their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="474128" tocid="">prayer</xref> life and church-building, in their quiet worship or their strenuous efforts to change the world, is to suggest even more of the variety.
            </p>
            <p>Given such complexity, it is natural that throughout Christian history both those in the tradition and those surrounding it have made attempts at simplification. Two ways to do this have been to concentrate on the “essence” of the faith, and thus on the ideas that are integral to it, or to be concerned with the “identity” of the tradition, and thus on the boundaries of its historical experience.</p>
            <p>
              Modern scholars have located the focus of this faith tradition in the context of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="390101" tocid="">monotheistic</xref> religions. Christianity addresses the historical figure of Jesus Christ against the background of, and while seeking to remain faithful to, the experience of one God. It has consistently rejected <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469156" tocid="">polytheism</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40634" tocid="">atheism</xref>.

              A second element of the faith tradition of Christianity, with rare exceptions, is a plan of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="520007" tocid="">salvation</xref> or redemption. That is to say, the believers in the church picture themselves as in a plight from which they need rescue. For whatever reason, they have been distanced from God and need to be saved. Christianity is based on a particular experience or scheme directed to the act of saving—that is, of bringing or “buying back,” which is part of what redemption means, these creatures of God to their source in God. The agent of that redemption is Jesus Christ.

              It is possible that through the centuries the vast majority of believers have not used the term <e>essence</e> to describe the central focus of their faith. The term is itself of Greek origin and thus represents only one part of the tradition, one element in the terms that have gone into making up Christianity. Essence refers to those qualities that give something its identity and are at the centre of what makes that thing different from everything else. To Greek philosophers it meant something intrinsic to and inherent in a thing or category of things, which gave it its character and thus separated it from everything of different character. Thus Jesus Christ belongs to the essential character of Christianity and gives it identity in the same way that <xref refid="1626679" ty="1" topicid="83105" tocid="">Buddha</xref> does for <xref refid="1650330" ty="1" topicid="83184" tocid="">Buddhism</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If most people are not concerned with defining the essence of Christianity, in practice they must come to terms with what the word <e>essence</e> implies. Whether they are engaged in being saved or redeemed on the one hand, or thinking and speaking about that redemption, its agent, and its meaning on the other, they are concentrating on the essence of their experience. Those who have concentrated from within the faith tradition have also helped to give it its identity. It is not possible to speak of the essence of a historical tradition without referring to how its ideal qualities have been discussed through the ages. Yet one can take up the separate subjects of essence and identity in sequence, being always aware of how they interrelate.

                  Jesus and the earliest members of the Christian faith tradition were Jews, and thus they stood in the faith tradition inherited by Hebrew people in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="296740" tocid="">Israel</xref> and the lands of the <xref refid="1765944" ty="1" topicid="161756" tocid="">Diaspora</xref>. They were monotheists, devoted to the God of Israel. When they claimed that Jesus was divine, they had to do so in ways that would not challenge <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="390101" tocid="">monotheism</xref>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Insofar as they began to separate or be separated from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307197" tocid="">Judaism</xref>, which did not accept Jesus as the <xref refid="1765945" ty="1" topicid="377146" tocid="">Messiah</xref>, the earliest Christians expressed certain ideas about the one on whom their faith focused. As with other religious people, they became involved in a search for truth. God, in the very nature of things, was necessarily the final Truth. In a reference preserved in the <xref refid="1626681" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref>, however, Jesus refers to himself not only as “the way” and “the life” but also as “the Truth.” Roughly, this meant “all the reality there is” and was a reference to Jesus’ participation in the reality of the one God.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the beginning there were Christians who may not have seen Jesus as the Truth, or as a unique participant in the reality of God. There have been “humanist” devotees of Jesus, modernist adapters of the truth about the Christ; but even in the act of adapting him to humanist concepts in their day they have contributed to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154700" tocid="">debate</xref> of the essence of Christianity and brought it back to the issues of monotheism and a way of salvation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It has been suggested that the best way to preserve the essence of Christianity is to look at the earliest documents—the four Gospels and the letters that make up much of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="412114" tocid="">New Testament</xref>—which contain the best account of what the earliest Christians remembered, taught, or believed about Jesus Christ. It is presumed that “the simple Jesus” and the “primitive faith” emerge from these documents as the core of the essence. This view has been challenged, however, by the view that the writings that make up the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="412114" tocid="">New Testament</xref> themselves reflect Jewish and Greek ways of thinking about Jesus and God. They are seen through the experience of different personalities, such as the apostle Paul or the nameless composers—traditionally identified as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—of documents that came to be edited as the Gospels. Indeed, there are not only diverse ways of worship, of polity or governance of the Christian community, and of behaviour pictured or prescribed in the New Testament but also diverse theologies, or interpretations of the heart of the faith. Most believers see these diversities as complementing each other and leave to scholars the argument that the primal documents may compete with and even contradict each other. Yet there is a core of ideas that all New Testament scholars and believers would agree are central to ancient Christian beliefs. One British scholar, James G. Dunn, for example, says they would all agree that “the Risen Jesus is the Ascended Lord.” That is to say, there would have been no faith tradition and no scriptures had not the early believers thought that Jesus was “Risen,” raised from the dead, and, as “Ascended,” somehow above the ordinary plane of mortal and temporal experience. From that simple assertion early Christians could begin to complicate the search for essence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An immediate question was how to combine the essential focus on Jesus with the essential monotheism. At various points in the New Testament and especially in the works of the <xref refid="1626699" ty="1" topicid="30100" tocid="">Apologists</xref>, late 1st- and 2nd-century writers who sought to defend and explain the faith to members of Greco-Roman society, Jesus is identified as the “preexistent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref>.” That is, before there was a historical Jesus born of <xref refid="1765946" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Mary</xref> and accessible to the sight and touch of Jews and others in his own day, there was a Logos—a principle of reason, an element of ordering, a “word”—that participated in the Godhead and thus existed, but which only preexisted as far as the “incarnate” Logos, the word that took on flesh and humanity (John 1:1–14), was concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In searching for an essence of truth and the way of salvation, some primitive Jewish Christian groups, such as the <xref refid="1626700" ty="1" topicid="177608" tocid="">Ebionites</xref>, and occasional theologians in later ages employed a metaphor of adoption. These theologians used as their source certain biblical passages (e.g., Acts 2:22). Much as an earthly parent might adopt a child, so the divine parent, the one Jesus called <e>abba</e> (Aramaic: “daddy,” or “father”), had adopted him and taken him into the heart of the nature of what it is to be God. There were countless variations of themes such as the preexistent Logos or the concept of adoption, but they provide some sense of the ways the early Apologists carried out their task of contributing to the definition of the essence of their Jesus-focused yet monotheistic faith.
                </p>
                <p>While it is easier to point to diversity than to simplicity or clarity among those who early expressed faith, it must also be said that from the beginning the believers insisted that they were—or were intended to be, or were commanded and were striving to be—united in their devotion to the essence of their faith tradition. There could not have been many final truths, and there were not many legitimate ways of salvation. It was of the essence of their tradition to reject other gods and other ways, and most defining of essence and identity occurred as one set of Christians was concerned lest others might deviate from the essential faith and might, for example, be attracted to other gods or other ways.</p>
                <p>
                  While Jesus lived among his disciples and those who ignored or rejected him, to make him the focus of faith or denial presented one type of issue. After the “Risen Jesus” had become the “Ascended Lord” and was no longer a visible physical presence, those at the head of the tradition had a different problem. Jesus remained, a present reality to them, and when they gathered to worship they believed that he was “in the midst of them.” He was present in their minds and hearts, in the spoken word that testified to him, and also present in some form when they had their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515425" tocid="">sacred</xref> meal and ingested bread and wine as his “body and blood.” They created a reality around this experience; if once Judaism was that reality, now Christianity resulted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The search for the essence of Christianity led people in the Greek world to concentrate on ideas. The focus on Jesus narrowed to ideas, to “beliefs about” and not only “belief in,” and to doctrines. The essence began to be cognitive, referring to what was known, or substantive. As debates over the cognitive or substantive aspects of Jesus’ participation in God became both intense and refined, the pursuit of essences became almost a matter of competition in the minds of the Apologists and the formulators of doctrines in the 3rd through the 6th centuries. During this time Christians met in council to develop statements of faith, confessions, and creeds. The claimed essence was used in conflict and rivalry with others. Christian Apologists began to speak, both to the Jews and to the other members of the Greco-Roman world, in terms that unfavourably compared their religions to Christianity. The essence also came to be a way to define who had the best credentials and was most faithful. The claim that one had discerned the essence of Christianity could be used to rule out the faithless, the apostate, or the heretic. The believers in the essential truth and way of salvation saw themselves as insiders and others as outsiders. This concept became important after the Christian movement had triumphed in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507739" tocid="">Roman Empire</xref>, which became officially Christian by the late 4th century. To fail to grasp or to misconceive what was believed to be the essence of faith might mean exile, harassment, or even death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early stages of the development of their faith, Christians did something rare if not unique in the history of religion: they adopted the entire scriptural canon of what they now saw to be another faith, Judaism, and embraced the Hebrew Scriptures, which they called the <xref refid="1765947" ty="1" topicid="259039" tocid="">Old Testament</xref>. But while doing so, they also incorporated the insistent monotheism of Judaism as part of the essence of their truth and way of salvation, just as they incorporated the Hebrew Scriptures’ story as part of their own identity-giving narrative and experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This narrowing of focus on Jesus Christ as truth meant also a complementary sharpening of focus on the way of salvation. There is no purpose in saving someone who does not need salvation. Christianity therefore began to make, through its councils and creeds, theologians and scholars, some attempts at definitive descriptions of what it is to be human. Later some of these descriptions were called “original sin,” the idea that all humans inherited from <xref refid="1765948" ty="1" topicid="4992" tocid="">Adam</xref>, the first-created human, a condition that made it impossible for them to be perfect or to please a personal God on their own. While Christians never agreed on a specific teaching on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432565" tocid="">original sin</xref>, they did describe as the essence of Christianity the fact that something limited humans and led them to need redemption. Yet the concentration always returned to Jesus Christ as belonging more to the essence of Christianity than did any statements about the human condition.
                </p>
                <p>The essence of Christianity eventually included statements about the reality to God. Christians inherited from the Jews a relatively intimate picture of a God who made their young and small universe, with its starry heavens, and then carried on discourse with humans, making covenants with them and rewarding or punishing them. But the Greek part of their tradition contributed the concept of a God who was greater than any ideas of God but who had to be addressed through ideas. Indeed, it was during this time that words such as essence, substance, and being—terms that did not belong to the Old or New Testament traditions—came to be wedded to biblical witness in the creeds. Christians used the vocabulary and repertory of options then available to them in speaking of the all-encompassing and the ineffable and grafted these onto the witness to God that was essential to their faith. Modern Christians, including many who reject the notion of creeds or any non-biblical language, are still left with the problems and intentions of the ancients: how to think of Jesus in such a way that they are devoted to him not in isolation, as an end in himself—for that would be idolatry of a human—but in the context of the total divine reality.</p>
                <p>
                  It is impossible to chronicle the efforts at expressing essence without pointing to diversity within the unity. Yet the belief in final unity belongs to any claims of finding an essence. Thus it was both a typical and a decisive moment when in the 5th century <xref refid="1765949" ty="1" topicid="629362" tocid="">Vincent of Lérins</xref>’s, a Gallo-Roman theologian, provided a formula according to which Christianity expressed a faith that “has been believed everywhere, always, and by all” (<e>quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est</e>). Even if not all Christians could agree on all formulations, it was widely held that there was some fundamental “thing” that had thus been believed.

                  For a thousand years, a period that began with what some historians called “Dark Ages” in the Christian West and that endured through both the Eastern and Western extensions of the Roman Empire, the essence of Christian faith was guarded differently than it had been in the first three centuries, before Christianity became official; throughout the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="380873" tocid="">Middle Ages</xref> itself the understanding of the essence evolved. In the 4th and 5th centuries, theologians including <xref refid="1765950" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">Ambrose</xref>, <xref refid="1765951" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine of Hippo</xref>, and <xref refid="1765952" ty="1" topicid="302749" tocid="">Jerome</xref> laid the foundations for the development of Christian thought. By the 5th century, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="66863" tocid="">bishop</xref> of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508807" tocid="">Rome</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469994" tocid="">pope</xref>, as a result of conciliar decisions and unique events in Rome, had become the leading spokesman for the faith in Latin, or Western, Christendom. This position would assume greater institutional strength in later periods of the Middle Ages. In the Eastern churches, despite the claims of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446582" tocid="">patriarch</xref> of Constantinople, no single pontiff ruled over the bishops, but they saw themselves just as surely and energetically in command of the doctrines that made up the essence of Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Western drama, especially after the year 1000, was more fateful for Christianity in the modern world. The pope and the bishops of Latin Christendom progressively determined the essence through doctrines and canons that enhanced the ancient grasp of faith. As they came to dominate in Europe, they sought to suppress contrary understandings of the essence of the faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Jews were confined to ghettos, segregated and self-segregated enclaves where they did not and could not share the full prerogatives of Christendom. When sects were defined as heretical—<xref refid="1626704" ty="1" topicid="634415" tocid="">Waldenses</xref>, <xref refid="1626705" ty="1" topicid="99473" tocid="">Cathari</xref>, and others—because of their repudiation of Roman Catholic concepts of Christian essence, they had to go into hiding or were pushed into enclaves beyond the reach of the custodians of official teaching. The essence of Christianity had become a set of doctrines and laws articulated and controlled by a hierarchy that saw those doctrines as a divine deposit of truth. Theologians might argue about the articulations with great subtlety and intensity, but in that millennium few would have chosen to engage in basic disagreement over the official teachings, all of which were seen to be corollaries of the basic faith in Jesus Christ as participating in the truth of God and providing the way of salvation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through these centuries there was also increasing differentiation between the official <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121276" tocid="">clergy</xref>, which administered the sacraments and oversaw the body of the faithful, and the laity. Most of what was debated centuries later about the essence of medieval Christianity came from the records of these authorities. As more is learned about the faith of the ordinary believers, it becomes more evident in the records of social history that people offered countless variations on the essence of the faith. Many people used the church’s officially legitimated faith in the power of saints’ relics to develop patterns of dealing with God that, according to the Protestant Reformers, detracted from the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the only agent of salvation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this thousand years in both Western and Eastern Christianity, when the faith had a cultural monopoly, there was an outburst of creativity and a fashioning of a Christian culture that greatly enhanced and complicated any once-simple notions of an essence. Christianity was as much a cultural tradition as it was a faith tradition, an assertion that the leadership of the medieval church would not have regarded as diminishing or insulting. Christianity as a cultural tradition is perhaps most vividly revealed in the magnificent cathedrals and churches that were built in the Middle Ages and in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283009" tocid="">illuminated manuscripts</xref> of the period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Christian culture grew ever more complex, however, there arose a constant stream of individual reformers who tried to get back to what they thought was its original essence. Among these was St. <xref refid="1626706" ty="1" topicid="216793" tocid="">Francis of Assisi</xref>, who in his personal style of devotion and simple way of life was often seen as capturing in his person and teachings more of the original essence of Jesus’ truth and way of salvation than did the ordained authorities in the church and empires. Unlike the Waldenses and members of other dissident groups, Francis accepted the authority of the ordained clergy and contributed to a reform and revival of the broader church.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late Middle Ages a number of dissenters emerged—such as <xref refid="1626707" ty="1" topicid="277400" tocid="">Jan Hus</xref> in Bohemia, <xref refid="1626708" ty="1" topicid="650168" tocid="">John Wycliffe</xref> in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="700965" tocid="">England</xref>, and <xref refid="1626709" ty="1" topicid="525815" tocid="">Girolamo Savonarola</xref> in Florence—who challenged the teachings of the church in more radical ways than someone like St. Francis did. For all their differences, they were united in their critique of what they thought complicated the essence of Christianity. On biblical prophetic grounds they sought simplicity in the cognitive, moral, and devotional life of Christianity.

                <p>
                  When the Protestant <xref refid="1626710" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> divided Western Christianity—as Eastern Christians, already separated since the 11th century, looked on—the 16th-century European world experienced a foretaste of the infinite Christian variety to come. The reforms that gave rise to the many Protestant bodies—<xref refid="1765953" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran</xref>, <xref refid="1765954" ty="1" topicid="24861" tocid="">Anglican</xref>, Presbyterian, <xref refid="1765956" ty="1" topicid="495584" tocid="">Reformed</xref>, <xref refid="1765957" ty="1" topicid="22160" tocid="">Anabaptist</xref>, <xref refid="1765958" ty="1" topicid="486026" tocid="">Quaker</xref>, and others—were themselves debates over the essence of Christianity. Taken together, they made it increasingly difficult for any one to claim a monopoly on the custodianship of that essence, try as they might. Each new sect offered a partial discernment of a different essence or way of speaking of it, even if the vast majority of Protestants agreed that the essence could be retrieved best, or, indeed uniquely, through recovery of the central message of the Holy Scriptures.
                </p>
                <p>After the ferment of the Reformation, most of the dissenting groups, as they established themselves in various nations, found it necessary to engage in their own narrowing of focus, rendering of precise doctrines, and understanding of divine truth and the way of salvation. Within a century theologians at many Protestant universities were adopting systems that paralleled the old scholasticisms against which some reformers had railed. Those who had once thought that definition of doctrine failed to capture the essence of Christianity were now defining their concept of the essence in doctrinal terms, but were doing so for Lutherans, Reformed, Presbyterians, and even for more radical dissenters and resistors of creeds, such as the Anabaptists.</p>
                <p>The belief of Vincent of Lérins that there is a faith that has been held by everyone, always, and everywhere, lived on through the proliferation of Protestant denominations and Roman Catholic movements and, in sophisticated ways, has helped animate the modern ecumenical movement.

Reunion, then, would mean a stripping away of accretions, a reducing of the number of arguments, and a refocusing on essentials.</p>

                  In the 19th century philosophical and historical criticism inspired some Christians to renew the search for essences. For example, in the wake of the German Idealist philosopher<xref refid="1626731" ty="1" topicid="259378" tocid=""> G.W.F. Hegel</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259438" tocid="">Hegelian</xref> scholars tried to rescue Christianity by viewing it as an unfolding of “absolute spirit.” They followed Christian history through a constant dialectic, a series of forces and counterforces producing new syntheses. A problem with the Hegelian approach arose as the historical Jesus came to be seen merely as one stage in the unfolding of absolute spirit; he was not a decisive agent of the way of salvation “once for all,” as the biblical <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259114" tocid="">Letter to the Hebrews</xref> had claimed him to be. Soon biblical scholars such as <xref refid="1626733" ty="1" topicid="568501" tocid="">David Friedrich Strauss</xref> were speaking of the historical Jesus as a myth of a certain set of people in one moment of the dialectical unfolding. The Christian faith itself began to dissolve, and many Hegelians began to reject the God of the Christian faith along with the historical Jesus.

                <p>
                  Another group of 19th-century theologians took the opposite course. In the spirit of the 18th-century German philosopher <xref refid="1626734" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Immanuel Kant</xref>, these <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="408668" tocid="">neo-Kantians</xref> spoke not of the noumenal world, the unseen realm of essences beyond visible reality, but of the phenomenal realm, the world of history in which things happened. Theologians in this school engaged in a century-long “quest for the historical Jesus,” in which they sought the simple essence of Christianity. Significantly, the greatest exemplar of this historical tradition, the German theologian <xref refid="1765961" ty="1" topicid="255617" tocid="">Adolf von Harnack</xref>, wrote one of the best-known modern books on the essence of Christianity, <e>Das Wesen des Christentums</e> (1900; <e>What Is Christianity?</e>).
                </p>
                <p>The call had come to purge Christianity of what Harnack called traces of “acute Hellenization,” the Greek ideas of essence, substance, and being that were introduced into the Christian tradition in its early history. The focus was shifted to the Fatherhood of God and the announcement of the Kingdom, as Jesus had proclaimed in the Gospels. While this approach matched the thirst for simplification in the minds of many of the Christian faithful, it also diminished the concept of God. The result was a form of Christian humanism that more traditional Christians regarded as a departure from the essence of Christianity. This view claimed to be based on the historical Jesus, but scholars could not agree on the details.</p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the modern period some thinkers took another route toward expressing the essence of Christianity. The notion that the theologians would never find the essence of Christianity grew among German Pietists, among the followers of <xref refid="1626758" ty="1" topicid="639945" tocid="">John Wesley</xref> into <xref refid="1626759" ty="1" topicid="378415" tocid="">Methodism</xref>, and in any number of Roman Catholic or Protestant devotional movements. Instead, according to these groups, the Christian essence was discernible in acts of piety, closeness to the fatherly heart of God as shown in the life of Jesus, and intimate communion with God on emotional or affective—not cognitive, rational, or substantial (i.e., doctrinal)—grounds. Although these pietisms have been immensely satisfying to millions of modern believers, they have been handicapped in the intellectual arena when pressed for the definitions people need in a world of choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some modern Christians have shifted the topic from the essence of Christianity to its absoluteness among the religions. They have been moved by what the Germans called <e>Religionswissenschaft</e>, the study of world religions. In that school, the focus fell on the sacred, what the German theologian <xref refid="1626760" ty="1" topicid="434884" tocid="">Rudolf Otto</xref> called “the idea of the Holy.” On those terms, as the German scholar <xref refid="1626761" ty="1" topicid="606217" tocid="">Ernst Troeltsch</xref> showed, it was more difficult to speak of the “absoluteness” of Christianity and its truth; one had to speak of it on comparative terms. Yet some early 20th-century comparativists, such as the Swedish Lutheran <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32660" tocid="">archbishop</xref> <xref refid="1626762" ty="1" topicid="552036" tocid="">Nathan Söderblom</xref>, applied their understanding of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497151" tocid="">study of religion</xref> to help animate the movement for Christian reunion.

                  The modern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178836" tocid="">ecumenical movement</xref> is based upon the belief that the church has different cultural expressions that must be honoured and differing confessional or doctrinal traditions designed to express the essential faith. These traditions demand criticism, comparison, and perhaps revision, with some possible blending toward greater consensus in the future. At the same time, supporters of the movement have shown that, among Christians of good will, elaborations of what constitutes the essence of Christianity are as confusing as they are inevitable and necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite this confusion, the ecumenical movement was an important development in the 20th century. It took institutional form in the <xref refid="1626775" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref> in 1948, which was composed of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches. The World Council emerged out of two organizations that offered distinct approaches to the essential concepts of the faith. One approach was devoted first to “Life and Work,” a view that the essentials of Christianity could be best found and expressed when people followed the way or did the works of Christ, since this constituted his essence. The other approach, concerned with “Faith and Order,” stressed the need for comparative study of doctrine, with critical devotion to the search for what was central. By no means did these groups cling any longer to the notion that when they found unity they would have found a simple essence of Christianity. Yet they believed that they could find compatible elements that would help to sustain them on the never-ending search for what was central to the faith tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some modern scholars—for example, the British theologian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304509" tocid="">John</xref> Hick—viewing the chaos of languages dealing with the essentials of the faith and the complex of historical arguments, pose the understanding of the essence in the future. They speak of “eschatological verification,” referring to the end, the time beyond history, or the time of fulfillment. In that future, one might say, it will have become possible to assess the claims of faith. Theologians of these schools argue that such futuristic notions motivate Christians and the scholars among them to clarify their language, refine their historical understandings, and focus their devotion and spirituality.

              <headtitle>The question of Christian identity</headtitle>
              <p>
                These comments on the search for the essence of Christianity, the task of defining the core of the faith tradition, demonstrate that the question of Christian identity is at stake at all times. What the psychologist <xref refid="1626778" ty="1" topicid="191536" tocid="">Erik Erikson </xref>said of the individual—that a sense of identity meant “the accrued confidence that one’s ability to maintain inner sameness and continuity . . . is <e>matched</e> by the sameness and continuity of one’s meaning for others”—can be translated to the concerns of the group. This means that Christians strive, in the midst of change, to have some “inner sameness and continuity” through the focus on Jesus Christ and the way of salvation. At the same time, Christians posit that this identity will be discoverable by and useful to those who are not part of the tradition: secularists, Buddhists, Communists, or other people who parallel or rival Christian claims about truth and salvation.
              </p>
              <p>
                On these terms, writers of Christian history normally begin phenomenologically when discussing Christian identity; that is, they do not bring norms or standards by which they have determined the truth of this or that branch of Christianity or even of the faith tradition as a whole but identify everyone as Christian who call themselves Christian. Thus, from one point of view, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the <xref refid="1626782" ty="1" topicid="392525" tocid="">Mormons</xref> as they are commonly called, is, in the view of scholar Jan Shipps, “a new religious tradition.” The followers of the <e>Book of Mormon</e> incorporated the Old and New Testaments into their canon—just as the New Testament Christians incorporated the entire <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="530020" tocid="">scripture</xref> of a previous tradition—and then supplied reinterpretations. As a new religious tradition, Mormonism would not be Christian. But because Mormons use Christian terminology and call themselves Christian, they might also belong to a discussion of Christianity. They may be perceived as departing from the essence of Christianity because other Christians regard their progressive doctrine of God as heretical. Yet Mormons in turn point to perfectionist views of humanity and progressive views of God among more conventionally accepted Christian groups. In areas where the Mormons want to be seen as “latter-day” restorers, basing their essential faith on scriptures not previously accessible to Christians, they would be ruled out of conventional Christian discussion and treatment. Yet they share much of Christian culture, focus their faith in Jesus, proclaim a way of salvation, and want to be included for other purposes, and thus fall into the context of a Christian identity at such times.
              </p>
              <p>This phenomenological approach, one that accents historical and contemporary description and resists prescription, does not allow the historian to state the essence of Christianity as a simple guide for all discussion. It is necessary for the scholar to put his own truth claims in a kind of suspension and to record faithfully, sorting out large schools of coherence and pointing to major strains. It is not difficult to state that something was a majority view if the supporting data are present. For example, it is not difficult to say what Roman Catholics at particular times have regarded as the essence of Christianity or what the various Orthodox and Protestant confessions regard as the true way of salvation. Someone using the phenomenological method, however, would stand back and refuse to be the arbiter when these confessional traditions disagree over truth.</p>
              <p>Vincent of Lérins, then, speaks more for the hunger of the Christian heart or the dream of Christian union than for the researcher, who finds it more difficult to see a moment when everyone agreed on everything everywhere. Yet it remains safe to say that Christian identity begins and ends with a reference to Jesus in relation to God’s truth and a way of salvation. The rest is a corollary of this central claim, an infinite set of variations and elaborations that are of great importance to the separated Christians who hold to them in various times and places.</p>

                <p>
                  Christianity began as a movement within Judaism at a period when the Jews had long been dominated culturally and politically by foreign powers and had found in their religion (rather than in their politics or cultural achievements) the linchpin of their community. From Amos (8th century <e ty="s">bc</e>) onward the religion of Israel was marked by tension between the concept of monotheism, with its universal ideal of salvation (for all nations), and the notion of God’s special choice of Israel. In the Hellenistic age (323 <e ty="s">bc</e>–3rd century <e ty="s">ad</e>), the dispersion of the Jews throughout the kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean and the Roman Empire reinforced this universalistic tendency. But the attempts of foreign rulers, especially the Syrian king <xref refid="1626637" ty="1" topicid="28380" tocid="">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</xref> (in 168–165 <e ty="s">bc</e>), to impose Greek culture in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439645" tocid="">Palestine</xref> provoked zealous resistance on the part of many Jews, leading to the revolt of <xref refid="1626808" ty="1" topicid="353851" tocid="">Judas Maccabeus</xref> against Antiochus. In Palestinian Judaism the predominant note was separation and exclusiveness. Jewish missionaries to other areas were strictly expected to impose the distinctive Jewish customs of circumcision, kosher food, and sabbaths and other festivals. Other Jews, however, were not so exclusive, welcoming Greek culture and accepting converts without requiring circumcision.

                  </thumbasm>The relationship of the earliest Christian churches to Judaism turned principally on two questions: (1) the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="377146" tocid="">messianic</xref> role of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus of Nazareth</xref> and (2) the permanent validity of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="599756" tocid="">Mosaic Law</xref> for all.

                <p>
                  The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="599756" tocid="">Hebrew Scriptures</xref> viewed history as the stage of a providential drama eventually ending in a triumph of God over all present sources of frustration (e.g., foreign domination or the sins of Israel). God’s rule would be established by an anointed prince (the Messiah) of the line of <xref refid="1765992" ty="1" topicid="152497" tocid="">David</xref>, king of Israel in the 10th century <e ty="s">bc</e>. The proper course of action leading to the consummation of the drama, however, was the subject of some disagreement. Among the diverse groups were the aristocratic and conservative <xref refid="1626638" ty="1" topicid="515862" tocid="">Sadducees</xref>, who accepted only the five books of Moses (the Pentateuch) and whose lives and political power were intimately associated with Temple worship, and the <xref refid="1626639" ty="1" topicid="455129" tocid="">Pharisees</xref>, who accepted the force of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="212142" tocid="">oral tradition</xref> and were widely respected for their learning and piety. The Pharisees not only accepted biblical books outside the Pentateuch but also embraced doctrines—such as those on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499816" tocid="">resurrection</xref> and the existence of angels—of recent acceptance in Judaism, many of which were derived from apocalyptic expectations that the consummation of history would be heralded by God’s intervention in the affairs of men in dramatic, cataclysmic terms. The <xref refid="1765994" ty="1" topicid="522434" tocid="">Sanhedrin</xref> (central council) at Jerusalem was made up of both Pharisees and Sadducees. The <xref refid="1626640" ty="1" topicid="656131" tocid="">Zealots</xref> were aggressive revolutionaries known for their violent opposition to Rome and its polytheisms. Other groups were the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="263495" tocid="">Herodians</xref>, supporters of the client kingdom of the Herods (a dynasty that supported Rome) and abhorrent to the Zealots, and the <xref refid="1626810" ty="1" topicid="193097" tocid="">Essenes</xref>, a quasi-monastic dissident group, probably including the sect that preserved the <xref refid="1626809" ty="1" topicid="154274" tocid="">Dead Sea Scrolls</xref>. This latter sect did not participate in the Temple worship at Jerusalem and observed another religious calendar; from their desert retreat they awaited divine intervention and searched prophetic writings for signs indicating the consummation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What relation the followers of Jesus had to some of these groups is not clear. In the canonical <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="239489" tocid="">Gospels</xref> (those accepted as authentic by the church) the main targets of criticism are the scribes and Pharisees, whose attachment to the tradition of Judaism is presented as legalistic and pettifogging. The Sadducees and Herodians likewise receive an unfriendly portrait. The Essenes are never mentioned. Simon, one of Jesus’ 12 disciples, was or had once been a Zealot. Jesus probably stood close to the Pharisees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under the social and political conditions of the time, there could be no long future either for the Sadducees or for the Zealots: their attempts to make apocalyptic dreams effective led to the desolation of Judaea and the destruction of the Temple after the two major Jewish revolts against the Romans in 66–70 and 132–135. The choice for many Jews, who were barred from Jerusalem after 135, thus lay between the Pharisees and the emerging Christian movement. Pharisaism as enshrined in the <xref refid="1626811" ty="1" topicid="385262" tocid="">Mishna</xref> (oral law) and the <xref refid="1626812" ty="1" topicid="581644" tocid="">Talmud</xref> (commentary on and addition to the oral law) became normative Judaism. By looking to the Gentile (non-Jewish) world and carefully dissociating itself from the Zealot revolutionaries and the Pharisees, Christianity made possible its ideal of a world religion, at the price of sacrificing Jewish particularity and exclusiveness. The fact that Christianity has never succeeded in gaining the allegiance of more than a small minority of Jews is more a mystery to theologians than to historians.

                  The prime sources for knowledge of Jesus of Nazareth are the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament. There are also a number of noncanonical sources, notably the apocryphal gospels, which contain stories about Jesus and sayings attributed to him. The <e>

At certain points the Gospel tradition finds independent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="132040" tocid="">confirmation</xref> in the letters of the apostle Paul. Although the allusions in non-Christian sources (the Jewish historian <xref refid="1626815" ty="1" topicid="306479" tocid="">Josephus</xref>, the Roman historians <xref refid="1626816" ty="1" topicid="579997" tocid="">Tacitus</xref> and <xref refid="1626817" ty="1" topicid="571641" tocid="">Suetonius</xref>, and Talmudic texts) are almost negligible, they refute the unsubstantiated notion that Jesus might never have existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first three Gospels, <xref refid="1626819" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref>, <xref refid="1626820" ty="1" topicid="365604" tocid="">Mark</xref>, and <xref refid="1626821" ty="1" topicid="351073" tocid="">Luke</xref>, are closely related in form, structure, and content. Because they can be studied in parallel columns called a synopsis, they are known as the <xref refid="1626818" ty="1" topicid="578522" tocid="">Synoptic</xref> Gospels. Mark was probably used by Matthew and Luke, who may also have used the Q Gospel (so-called from the German <e>Quelle</e>, “source”; Q is the hypothetical Gospel that is the origin of common material in later Gospels). <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">John</xref>, differing in both pattern and content, appears richer in theological interpretation but may also preserve good historical information. The Gospels are not detached reports but were written to serve the religious needs of the early Christian communities. Legendary and apologetic (defensive) motifs, and the various preoccupations of the communities for which they were first produced, can readily be discerned as influences upon their narratives. Although many details of the Gospels remain the subject of disagreement and uncertainty, the scholarly consensus accepts the substance of the Gospel tradition as a truthful account.

                  </thumbasm>The chronology of the life of Jesus is one of the matters of uncertainty.

                  Jesus’ encounter with <xref refid="1626829" ty="1" topicid="305173" tocid="">John the Baptist</xref>, the ascetic in the Judaean Desert who preached repentance and baptism in view of God’s coming Kingdom, marked a decisive moment for his career. He recognized in John the forerunner of the kingdom that his own <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="384252" tocid="">ministry</xref> proclaimed. The first preaching of Jesus, in his home region of Galilee, took the form of vivid parables and was accompanied by miraculous healings. The Synoptic writers describe a single climactic visit of Jesus to Jerusalem at the end of his career; but John may be right (implicitly supported by Luke 13:7) in representing his visits as more frequent and the period of ministry as lasting more than a single year. Jesus’ attitude to the observance of the law generated conflict with the Pharisees; he also aroused the fear and hostility of the ruling Jewish authorities. A triumphal entry to Jerusalem at Passover time (the period celebrating the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt in the 13th century <e ty="s">bc</e>) was the prelude to a final crisis. After a last supper with his disciples he was betrayed by one of them, <xref refid="1626918" ty="1" topicid="307411" tocid="">Judas Iscariot</xref>. Arrest and trial followed, first before the Sanhedrin and then before Pilate, who condemned him to crucifixion. According to the Evangelists, Pilate condemned Jesus reluctantly, finding no fault in him. Their version of the condemnation was an attempt to keep Jesus from appearing guilty in Roman eyes, and it was a means for the early Christian community to find its way in the Roman world. In any event, Jesus was executed in a manner reserved for political or religious agitators. It was a universal Christian belief that three days after his death he was raised from the dead by divine power.

The words and acts of Jesus were believed to be the inauguration of a process that was to culminate in a final triumph of God. His disciples recognized him as the Messiah, the Anointed One, though there is no record of him using the word (except indirectly) in reference to himself. The titles Prophet and Rabbi also were applied to him. His own enigmatic self-designation was “Son of man,” sometimes in allusion to his suffering, sometimes to his future role as judge. This title is derived from the version of the <xref refid="1766750" ty="1" topicid="150969" tocid="">Book of Daniel</xref> (7:13), where “one like a son of man,” contrasted with beast figures, represents the humiliated people of God, ascending to be vindicated by the divine Judge. In the developed Gospel tradition the theme of the transcendent judge seems to be most prominent.

                  Apocalyptic hope could easily merge into messianic zealotry. Moreover, Jesus’ teaching was critical of the established order and encouraged the poor and oppressed, even though it contained an implicit rejection of revolution. Violence was viewed as incompatible with the ethic of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>. Whatever contacts there may have been with the Zealot movement (as the narrative of feeding 5,000 people in the desert may hint), the Gospels assume the widest distance between Jesus’ understanding of his role and the Zealot revolution.

                  With this distance from revolutionary idealism goes a sombre estimate of human perfectibility. The gospel of repentance presupposes deep defilement in individuals and in society. The sufferings and pains of humanity under the power of evil spirits calls out for compassion and an urgent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="385426" tocid="">mission</xref>. All the acts of a disciple must express love and forgiveness, even to enemies, and also detachment from property and worldly wealth. To Jesus, the outcasts of society (prostitutes, the hated and oppressive tax agents, and others) were objects of special care, and censoriousness was no <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="630187" tocid="">virtue</xref>. Though the state is regarded as a distant entity in certain respects, it yet has the right to require taxes and civic obligations: Caesar has rights that must be respected and are not incompatible with the fulfillment of God’s demands.

                  Some of the futurist sayings, if taken by themselves, raise the question whether Jesus intended to found a church. A negative answer emerges only if the authentic Jesus is assumed to have expected an immediate catastrophic intervention by God. There is no doubt that he gathered and intended to gather around him a community of followers. This community continued after his time, regarding itself as the specially called congregation of God’s people, possessing as covenant signs the rites of <xref refid="1626846" ty="1" topicid="52311" tocid="">baptism</xref> and <xref refid="1626847" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Eucharist</xref> (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Lord’s Supper</xref>) with which Jesus was particularly associated—baptism because of his example, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Eucharist</xref> because the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331170" tocid="">Last Supper</xref> on the night before the crucifixion was marked as an anticipation of the messianic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="203113" tocid="">feast</xref> of the coming age.

                  A closely related question is whether Jesus intended his gospel to be addressed to Jews only or if the Gentiles were also to be included. In the Gospels Gentiles appear as isolated exceptions, and the choice of 12 Apostles has an evident symbolic relation to the 12 tribes of Israel. The fact that the extension of Christian preaching to the Gentiles caused intense debate in the 40s of the 1st century is decisive proof that Jesus had given no unambiguous directive on the matter. Gospel sayings that make the Jews’ refusal to recognize Jesus’ authority as the ground for extending the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref> to the Gentiles must, therefore, have been cast by the early community.

While on a mission to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="150420" tocid="">Damascus</xref> to persecute the followers of Jesus, Paul was suddenly converted to faith in Christ and, simultaneously, to a conviction that the Gospel must pass to the non-Jewish world under conditions that dispensed with exclusively and distinctively Jewish ceremonies. Paul was disapproved by Christian Jews and remained throughout his career a controversial figure. He gained recognition for the converts of the Gentile mission by the Christian community in Jerusalem; but his work was considered an affront to Jewish traditionalism. He saw clearly that the universal mission of the church to all humanity, implicit in the coming of the Messiah, or Christ, meant a radical break with rabbinical traditions.

                  Owing to the preservation of some weighty letters, Paul is the only vivid figure of the apostolic age (1st century <e ty="s">ad</e>). Like his <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="182194" tocid="">elder</xref> contemporary <xref refid="1626856" ty="1" topicid="456612" tocid="">Philo of Alexandria</xref>, also a Hellenized Jew of the dispersion, he interpreted the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> allegorically and affirmed the primacy of spirit over letter in a manner that was in line with Jesus’ freedom with regard to the sabbath. The crucifixion of Jesus he viewed as the supreme redemptive act and also as the means of expiation for the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="545534" tocid="">sin</xref> of mankind. Salvation is, in Paul’s thought, therefore, not found by a conscientious moralism but rather is a gift of grace, a doctrine in which Paul was anticipated by Philo. But Paul linked this doctrine with his theme that the Gospel represents liberation from the Mosaic Law. The latter thesis created difficulties at Jerusalem, where the Christian community was led by <xref refid="1766753" ty="1" topicid="299860" tocid="">James</xref>, the brother of Jesus, and the circle of the intimate disciples of Jesus. James, martyred at Jerusalem in 62, was the primary authority for the Christian Jews, especially those made anxious by Paul; the canonical letter ascribed to James opposes the antinomian (anti-law) interpretations of the doctrine of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308779" tocid="">justification</xref> by faith. A middle position seems to have been occupied by <xref refid="1766754" ty="1" topicid="453832" tocid="">Peter</xref>. All the Gospels record a special commission of Jesus to Peter as the leader among the 12 Apostles. But Peter’s biography can only be dimly constructed; he died in Rome (according to early tradition) in <xref refid="1766755" ty="1" topicid="409505" tocid="">Nero</xref>’s persecution (64) about the same time as Paul.

                  The supremacy of the Gentile mission within the church was ensured by the effects on Jewish Christianity of the fall of Jerusalem (70) and <xref refid="1766756" ty="1" topicid="251204" tocid="">Hadrian</xref>’s exclusion of all Jews from the city (135). Jewish Christianity declined and became the faith of a very small group without links to either synagogue or Gentile church.

                  In Paul’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590855" tocid="">theology</xref>, the human achievement of Jesus was important because his obedient fidelity to his vocation gave moral and redemptive value to his self-sacrifice. A different emphasis appears in The <xref refid="1766757" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref>, written (according to 2nd-century tradition) at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189556" tocid="">Ephesus</xref>. John’s Gospel partly reflects local disputes, not only between the church and the Hellenized synagogue but also between various Christian groups, including Gnostic communities in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="38479" tocid="">Asia</xref> Minor. John’s special individuality lies in his view of the relation between the historical events of the tradition and the Christian community’s present experience of redemption. The history is treated symbolically to provide a vehicle for faith. Because it is less attached to the contingent events of a particular man’s life, John’s conception of the preexistent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref> becoming incarnate (made flesh) in Jesus made intelligible to the Hellenistic world the universal significance of Jesus. In antiquity, divine presence had to be understood as either inspiration or incarnation. If the Synoptic Gospels suggest inspiration, The Gospel According to John chooses incarnation. The tension between these two types of <xref refid="1766759" ty="1" topicid="115761" tocid="">Christology</xref> (doctrines of Christ) first became acute in the debate between the schools of Antioch and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14376" tocid="">Alexandria</xref> in the late 4th century.

                  In his <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508652" tocid="">letter</xref> to the Romans, Paul affirmed the providential role of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">government</xref> in restraining evil. Christians did not need to be disaffected from the empire, though the deification of the emperor was offensive to them. Moreover, although as an agency of social welfare the church offered much to the downtrodden elements in society, the Christians did not at any stage represent a social and political threat. After the example of their master, the Christians encouraged humility and patience before wicked men. Even the institution of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="548305" tocid="">slavery</xref> was not the subject of fundamental Christian criticism before the 4th century. The church, however, was not lost in pious <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400861" tocid="">mysticism</xref>. It provided for far more than the cultic (liturgical) needs of its members. Inheriting a Jewish moral ideal, its activities included food for the poor, orphans, and foundlings; care for prisoners; and a community funeral service.

                <p>
                  Christianity also inherited from Judaism a strong sense of being holy, separate from idolatry and pagan eroticism. As <xref refid="1766760" ty="1" topicid="469156" tocid="">polytheism</xref> permeated ancient society, a moral rigorism severely limited Christian participation in some trades and professions. At baptism a Christian was expected to renounce his occupation if that implicated him in public or private compromise with polytheism, superstition, dishonesty, or vice. There was disagreement about military service, however. The majority held that a soldier, if converted and baptized, was not required to leave the army, but there was hesitation about whether an already baptized Christian might properly enlist. Strict Christians also thought poorly of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="585183" tocid="">teaching</xref> profession because it involved instructing the young in literature replete with pagan ideals and what was viewed as indecency. Acting and dancing were similarly suspect occupations, and any involvement in magic was completely forbidden.

                <p>
                  The Christian ethic therefore demanded some detachment from society, which in some cases made for economic difficulties. The structure of ancient society was dominated not by class but by the relationship of patron and client. A slave or freedman depended for his livelihood and prospects upon his patron, and a man’s power in society was reflected in the extent of his dependents and supporters. In antiquity a strong patron was indispensable if one was negotiating with police or tax authorities or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="140637" tocid="">law courts</xref> or if one had ambitions in the imperial service. The authority of the father of the family was considerable. Often, Christianity penetrated the social strata first through women and children, especially in the upper classes. But once the householder was a Christian, his dependents tended to follow. The Christian community itself was close-knit. Third-century evidence portrays Christians banking their money with fellow believers; and widely separated groups helped one another with trade and mutual assistance.

                  Women in ancient society—<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244768" tocid="">Greek</xref>, Roman, or Jewish—had a domestic, not a public, role; feminine subordination was self-evident. To Paul, however, Christian faith transcends barriers to make all free and equal (Galatians 3:28). Of all ancient writers Paul was the most powerful spokesman for equality. Nevertheless, just as he refused to harbour a runaway slave, so he opposed any practice that would identify the church with social radicalism (a principal pagan charge against it). Paul did not avoid self-contradiction (1 Corinthians 11:5, 14:34–35). His opposition to a public liturgical role for women decided subsequent Catholic tradition in the East and West. Yet in the Greek churches (though not often in the Latin) women were ordained as deacons—in the 4th century by prayer and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="254238" tocid="">imposition of hands</xref> with the same rite as male deacons—and had a special responsibility at women’s baptism. Widows and orphans were the neediest in antiquity, and the church provided them substantial relief. It also encouraged vows of virginity, and by <e ty="s">ad</e> 400 women from wealthy or politically powerful families acquired prominence as superiors of religious communities. It seemed natural to elect as abbess a woman whose family connections might bring benefactions.

                  The religious environment of the Gentile mission was a tolerant, syncretistic blend of many cults and myths. Paganism was concerned with success; the gods were believed to give victory in war, good harvests, success in love and marriage, and sons and daughters. Defeat, famine, civil disorder, and infertility were recognized as signs of cultic pollution and disfavour. People looked to religion for help in mastering the forces of nature rather than to achieve moral improvement. Individual gods cared either for specific human needs or for specific places and groups. The transcendent God of biblical religion was, therefore, very different from the numerous gods of limited power and local significance. In Asia Minor Paul and his coworker Barnabas were taken to be gods in mortal form because of their miracles. To offer <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515665" tocid="">sacrifice</xref> on an altar seemed a natural expression of gratitude to any dead, or even living, benefactor. Popular enthusiasm could bestow divine honours on such heroes as dead pugilists and athletes. In the Roman Empire it seemed natural to offer sacrifice and burn incense to the divine emperor as a symbol of loyalty, much like standing for a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="404335" tocid="">national anthem</xref> today.

                  Traditional <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">Roman religion</xref> was a public cult, not private mysticism, and was upheld because it was the received way of keeping <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="258844" tocid="">heaven</xref> friendly. To refuse participation was thought to be an expression of disloyalty. The Jews were granted exemption for their refusal because their monotheism was an ancestral national tradition. The Christians, however, did everything in their power to dissuade people from following the customs of their fathers, whether Gentiles or Jews, and thereby seemed to threaten the cohesion of society and the principle that each group was entitled to follow its national customs in religion.

                  If ancient religion was tolerant, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1350843" tocid="">philosophical</xref> schools were seldom so. Platonists, Aristotelians, Stoics, <xref refid="1766761" ty="1" topicid="189732" tocid="">Epicureans</xref>, and <xref refid="1766762" ty="1" topicid="547424" tocid="">Skeptics</xref> tended to be very critical of one another. By the 1st century <e ty="s">bc</e>, an eclecticism emerged; and by the 2nd century <e ty="s">ad</e>, there developed a common stock of philosophy shared by most educated people and by some professional philosophers, which derived metaphysics involving theories on the nature of Being from <xref refid="1626926" ty="1" topicid="464109" tocid="">Plato</xref>, ethics from the <xref refid="1626927" ty="1" topicid="566892" tocid="">Stoics</xref>, and logic from <xref refid="1626928" ty="1" topicid="34560" tocid="">Aristotle</xref>. This eclectic <xref refid="1626929" ty="1" topicid="464215" tocid="">Platonism</xref> provided an important background and springboard for early Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30078" tocid="">apologetics</xref>. Its main outlines appear already in Philo of Alexandria, whose thought influenced not only perhaps the writer of the anonymous letter to the <xref refid="1626930" ty="1" topicid="259114" tocid="">Hebrews</xref>, traditionally held to be Paul, in the New Testament but also the great Christian thinkers <xref refid="1626931" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement of Alexandria</xref>, <xref refid="1626932" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref>, and <xref refid="1626933" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">Ambrose of Milan</xref>. Because of this widespread philosophical tendency in ancient society, the Christian could generally assume some belief in Providence and assent to high moral imperatives among his pagan contemporaries. Platonism in particular provided a metaphysical framework within which the Christians could interpret the entire pattern of creation, the Fall of humanity, the incarnation, redemption, the church, sacraments, and last things.

                  In the first Christian generation, authority in the church lay either in the kinsmen of Jesus or in those whom he had commissioned as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30208" tocid="">Apostles</xref> and missionaries. The Jerusalem church under James, the brother of Jesus, was the mother church. Paul admitted that if they had refused to grant recognition to his Gentile converts he would have laboured in vain. If there was an attempt to establish a hereditary family overlordship in the church, it did not succeed. Among the Gentile congregations, the Apostles sent by Jesus enjoyed supreme authority. As long as the Apostles lived, there existed a living authoritative voice to which appeal could be made. But once they all had died, there was an acute question regarding the locus of authority. The earliest documents of the 3rd and 4th Christian generations are mainly concerned with this issue: what is the authority of the ministerial hierarchy? The apostolic congregations had normally been served by elders (Greek <e>

The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121276" tocid="">clergy</xref> were responsible for preaching, for administering baptism and Eucharist, and for distributing aid to the poor. In each city the senior member of the college (assembly) of presbyters, the bishop, naturally had some special authority; he corresponded with other churches and would attend the ordinations of new bishops as the representative of his own community and as a symbol of the catholicity—the universality and unity—of the church of Christ.

                  <xref refid="1626936" ty="1" topicid="282296" tocid="">Ignatius</xref>, bishop of Antioch early in the 2nd century, wrote seven letters on his way to martyrdom at Rome that indicate how critical the centrifugal forces in the church had made the problem of authority. The bishop, he insisted, is the unique focus of unity without whose authority there is no <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515366" tocid="">sacrament</xref> and no church. A few years earlier the letter of Bishop <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121001" tocid="">Clement of Rome</xref> (<e>c.</e> <e ty="s">ad</e> 95) to the church at Corinth based the hierarchy’s authority on the concept of a historical succession of duly authorized teachers. Clement understood the clergy and laity to be essentially distinct orders within the one community, just as in the Old Testament there were <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="265328" tocid="">high priests</xref>, priests, Levites (Temple functionaries), and laymen. The principles of Clement and Ignatius became important when the church was faced by people claiming recognition for their special charismatic (spiritual) gifts and especially by Gnostic heretics claiming to possess secret oral traditions whispered by Jesus to his disciples and not contained in publicly accessible records such as the Gospels. Indeed, in his conflicts with the Gnostics in the late 2nd century, <xref refid="1626937" ty="1" topicid="293911" tocid="">Irenaeus of Lyons</xref> promoted the idea of <xref refid="1766763" ty="1" topicid="30289" tocid="">apostolic succession</xref>, the teaching that the bishops stand in a direct line of succession from the Apostles.

By the end of the 3rd century the bishop of the provincial capital was acquiring authority over his colleagues: the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378862" tocid="">metropolitan</xref> (from the 4th century on, often entitled <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="32660" tocid="">archbishop</xref>) was chief consecrator of his episcopal colleagues. The bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch in the 3rd century were accorded some authority beyond their own provinces, in part because the first bishop of each of those cities was thought to have been one of the Apostles. Along with Jerusalem and Constantinople (founded in 330), these three sees (seats of episcopal authority) became the five <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446582" tocid="">patriarchates</xref>. The title <e>papa</e> (“father”) was for 600 years an affectionate term applied to any bishop to whom one’s relation was intimate; it began to be specially used of bishops of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508807" tocid="">Rome</xref> from the 6th century and by the 9th century was almost exclusively applied to them.

                  From the beginning, Christians in Rome claimed for themselves special responsibilities to lead the church. About <e ty="s">ad</e> 165, memorials were erected at Rome to the Apostles Peter—traditionally considered the first bishop of Rome—and Paul: to Peter in a necropolis on the Vatican Hill and to Paul on the road to Ostia. The construction reflects a sense of being guardians of an apostolic tradition, a self-consciousness expressed in another form when, about 190, Bishop <xref refid="1766764" ty="1" topicid="627534" tocid="">Victor</xref> of Rome threatened with excommunication Christians in Asia Minor who, following local custom, observed <xref refid="1626946" ty="1" topicid="176858" tocid="">Easter</xref> on the day of the Jewish Passover rather than (as at Rome) on the Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. <xref refid="1766765" ty="1" topicid="565419" tocid="">Stephen</xref> of Rome (256) is the first known pope to base claims to authority on Jesus’ commission to Peter (Matthew 16:18–19).

                <p>Bishops were elected by their congregations—i.e., by the clergy and laity assembled together. But the consent of the laity decreased in importance as recognition by other churches increased. The metropolitan and other provincial bishops soon became just as important as the congregation as a whole; and, though they could never successfully impose a man on a solidly hostile community, they could often prevent the appointment falling under the control of one powerful lay family or faction. From the 4th century on, the emperors occasionally intervened to fill important sees, but such occurrences were not a regular phenomenon (until the 6th century in Merovingian Gaul).</p>

                  </thumbasm>After the initial problems regarding the continuity and authority of the hierarchy, the greatest guarantee of true continuity and authenticity was found in the Scriptures. Christians inherited (without debate at first) the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259039" tocid="">Hebrew Bible</xref> as the Word of God to the people of God at a now superseded stage of their pilgrimage through history. If St. Paul’s Gentile mission was valid, then the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> Law was viewed as no longer God’s final word to his people. Thus, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259039" tocid="">Hebrew Bible</xref> began to be called the “old” covenant. There was some hesitation in the church about the exact books included. The Greek version of the Old Testament (<xref refid="1626947" ty="1" topicid="535154" tocid="">Septuagint</xref>) included books (such as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="553548" tocid="">Wisdom of Solomon</xref>, Ecclesiasticus, and others) that were not accepted in the Hebrew canon. Most, but not all, Gentile Christian communities accepted the Septuagintal canon. The 3rd-century Alexandrian theologian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref> and especially the Latin biblical scholar <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302749" tocid="">Jerome</xref> (4th–5th century) believed it imprudent to base theological affirmations on books enjoying less than universal recognition. The fact that in many English Bibles the parts of the Old Testament accepted in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="535154" tocid="">Septuagint</xref> but not in the Hebrew canon are often printed separately under the (misleading) title <xref refid="1626948" ty="1" topicid="29773" tocid="">Apocrypha</xref> is a tribute to these ancient hesitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The growth of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="412114" tocid="">New Testament</xref> is more complex and controversial. The earliest Christians used oral tradition to pass on the story of Jesus’ acts and words, often told in the context of preaching and teaching. As the first generation passed away, however, the need for a more permanent and lasting tradition of the life of Jesus became apparent. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365621" tocid="">Mark</xref> first conceived the plan of composing a connected narrative, probably in the decade before—or at some time near—<e ty="s">ad</e> 70, when the Temple was destroyed by the Romans. The Gospels that traditionally were thought to have been written by Matthew and Luke borrowed from Mark and were compiled in the generation after his Gospel. Toward the end of the first century, and reflecting the persecutions of the emperor <xref refid="1626957" ty="1" topicid="168802" tocid="">Domitian</xref>, The Gospel According to John was written. Nevertheless, even after the Gospels were in common circulation, oral tradition was still current; it may even have been preferred. The Gospels themselves, which were probably intended for pastoral uses, did not immediately assume the status of scripture. Well into the 3rd century, new gospels were being compiled, such as the Gospel of Thomas and the <xref refid="1766768" ty="1" topicid="307402" tocid="">Gospel of Judas</xref>, which were not incorporated into the canonical New Testament. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578522" tocid="">Synoptic Gospels</xref> seem to have been used by the Apologist <xref refid="1626955" ty="1" topicid="308822" tocid="">Justin Martyr</xref> at Rome about <e ty="s">ad</e> 150 in the form of an early harmony (or synthesis of the Gospels); to this, Justin’s Syrian pupil <xref refid="1626956" ty="1" topicid="584214" tocid="">Tatian</xref> added The Gospel According to John to make his <e>
                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="161810" tocid="">Diatessaron</xref>
                  </e> (according to the four), a harmony of all four Gospels so successful that in Mesopotamia (Tatian’s homeland) it virtually ousted the separate Gospels for 250 years. And in the late 2nd century, Irenaeus accepted as the standard version of the Christian scriptures the four Gospels and several other texts that would become part of the canonical New Testament.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a second level of authority stood the apostolic letters, especially those of Paul. The first of the letters appeared about <e ty="s">ad</e> 50, and well before <e ty="s">ad</e> 90 the main body of his correspondence was circulating as a corpus (body of writings). Paul’s letters were the earliest texts of the Christian Scriptures. In addition to them, there are the seven so-called Catholic Letters (i.e., James, I and II Peter, I, II, and III John, and Jude), which were among the last of the literature to be accepted as part of the canonical New Testament.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paul’s antitheses of law and grace, justice and goodness, and the letter and the spirit were extended further than Paul intended by the radical semi-Gnostic heretic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364265" tocid="">Marcion of Pontus</xref> (<e>c.</e> 140–150), who taught that the Old Testament came from the inferior vengeful Jewish God of justice and that the New Testament told of the kindly universal Father. As the current texts of Gospels and letters presupposed some divine revelation through the Old Testament, Marcion concluded that they had been corrupted and interpolated by Judaizers. Marcion therefore established a fixed canon of an edited version of Luke’s Gospel and some of the Pauline Letters (expurgated), and no Old Testament at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The orthodox reaction (by such theologians as Justin, Irenaeus, and <xref refid="1627023" ty="1" topicid="588511" tocid="">Tertullian</xref> in the 2nd century) was to insist on the Gospel as the fulfillment of prophecy and on creation as the ground of redemption. Reasons were found for accepting the four already current Gospels, the full corpus of Pauline Letters, Acts of the Apostles, John’s Revelation (Apocalypse), and the Catholic Letters. On the authorship of the <xref refid="1766775" ty="1" topicid="259114" tocid="">Letter to the Hebrews</xref> there were doubts: Rome rejected it as non-Pauline and Alexandria accepted it as Pauline. The list once established was a criterion (the meaning of “canon”) for the authentic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="239489" tocid="">Gospel</xref> of the new covenant and soon (by transference from the old) became entitled the New Testament. (The Greek word <e>diathēkē</e> means both covenant and testament.) The formation of the canon meant that special revelation ended with the death of the Apostles and that no authority could be attached to the apocryphal gospels, acts, and apocalypses proliferating in the 2nd century.

                  Third, a check was found in the <xref refid="1626968" ty="1" topicid="142374" tocid="">creed</xref>, an authoritative profession of the faith. At baptism, after renouncing “the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="160173" tocid="">devil</xref> and his pomps,” initiates declared their faith in response to three questions of the form:<qt>
                    <qtpara>
                      Do you believe in God the Father almighty? Do you believe in Jesus Christ his Son our Lord. . . ? Do you believe in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> in the church and in the Resurrection?

                <p>
                  In time, these interrogations became the basis of declaratory creeds, adapted for use by clergy who felt themselves required to reassure colleagues who were not especially confident of their orthodoxy. The so-called <xref refid="1626967" ty="1" topicid="30242" tocid="">Apostles’ Creed</xref>, a direct descendant of the baptismal interrogation used at Rome by <e ty="s">ad</e> 200, is similar to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142374" tocid="">creed</xref> used in Rome in the 3rd and 4th centuries.

                  <xref refid="1626969" ty="1" topicid="236343" tocid="">Gnosticism</xref>, from the Greek <e>gnōstikos</e> (one who has <e>gnōsis</e>, or “secret knowledge”), was an important movement in the early Christian centuries—especially the 2nd—that offered an alternative to emerging orthodox Christian teaching. Gnostics taught that the world was created by a demiurge or satanic power—which they often associated with the God of the Old Testament— and that there is total opposition between this world and God. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="520007" tocid="">Redemption</xref> was viewed as liberation from the chaos of a creation derived from either incompetent or malevolent powers, a world in which the elect are alien prisoners.

                  Along with Irenaeus and others, the writers of the later New Testament books seem to have opposed early Gnosticism. The supporters of what would become orthodox Christianity stressed the need to adhere to tradition, which was attested by the churches of apostolic foundation. A more hazardous reply was to appeal to ecstatic prophecy. About <e ty="s">ad</e> 172 a quasi-pentecostal movement in Phrygia was led by <xref refid="1627019" ty="1" topicid="390572" tocid="">Montanus</xref> with two prophetesses, Prisca and Maximilla, reasserting the imminence of the end of the world.

                  The Christians were not respectful toward ancestral pagan customs, and their preaching of a new king sounded like revolution. The opposition of the Jews to them led to breaches of the peace. Thus the Christians could very well be unpopular, and they often were. Paul’s success at Ephesus provoked a riot to defend the cult of the goddess Artemis. In <e ty="s">ad</e> 64 a fire destroyed much of Rome; the emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409505" tocid="">Nero</xref>, in order to escape blame, killed a “vast multitude” of Christians as scapegoats. For the first time, Rome was conscious that Christians were distinct from Jews. But there probably was no formal senatorial enactment proscribing Christianity at this time. Nero’s persecution, which was local and short, was condemned by <xref refid="1766778" ty="1" topicid="579997" tocid="">Tacitus</xref> as an expression of the emperor’s cruelty rather than as a service to the public good. Soon thereafter, however, the profession of Christianity was defined as a capital crime—though of a special kind, because one gained pardon by apostasy (rejection of a faith once confessed) demonstrated by offering sacrifice to the pagan gods or to the emperor. Popular gossip soon accused the Christians of secret vices, such as eating murdered infants (due to the secrecy surrounding the Lord’s Supper and the use of the words body and blood) and sexual promiscuity (due to the practice of Christians calling each other “brother” or “sister” while living as husband and wife).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early persecutions were sporadic, caused by local conditions and dependent on the attitude of the governor. The fundamental cause of persecution was the Christians’ conscientious rejection of the gods whose favour was believed to have brought success to the empire. But distrust was increased by Christian detachment and reluctance to serve in the imperial service and in the army. At any time in the 2nd or 3rd centuries, Christians could find themselves the object of unpleasant attention. Violence against them could be precipitated by a bad harvest, a barbarian attack, or a public festival of the emperor cult. Yet, there were also long periods of peace, and the stability provided by the empire and its network of roads and communications may have facilitated Christianity’s growth. The ambivalence of official policy is perhaps best revealed in the exchange between <xref refid="1627057" ty="1" topicid="464843" tocid="">Pliny the Younger</xref>, governor of Bithynia, and the emperor <xref refid="1627058" ty="1" topicid="602150" tocid="">Trajan</xref> in 111. Pliny executed Christians who were brought before him and who refused to worship the emperor and Roman gods but then sought the emperor’s advice on how to treat Christians in his province. Trajan responded that Christians legitimately brought before Pliny should be punished but that the governor should not seek out Christians for persecution. The Christians should be left alone as long as they did not stir up trouble.

                <p>
                  Organized, empire-wide persecutions occurred, however, at moments of extreme crisis and as a response to the growth of the faith. During the 3rd century, economic collapse, political chaos, military revolt, and barbarian invasion nearly destroyed the empire. Christians were blamed for the desperate situation because they denied the gods who were thought to protect Rome, thereby bringing down their wrath. To regain divine protection, the emperors introduced the systematic persecution of Christians throughout the empire. The emperor <xref refid="1627061" ty="1" topicid="155162" tocid="">Decius</xref> (reigned 249–251) issued an edict requiring all citizens to offer sacrifice to the emperor and to obtain from commissioners a certificate witnessing to the act. Many of these certificates have survived. The requirement created an issue of conscience, especially because certificates could be bought. The great bishop-theologian <xref refid="1627059" ty="1" topicid="148534" tocid="">Cyprian</xref> of Carthage was martyred during the next great wave of persecutions (257–259), which were aimed at eradicating the leaders of the church. The persecuting emperor <xref refid="1627060" ty="1" topicid="622081" tocid="">Valerian</xref>, however, became a Persian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477235" tocid="">prisoner of war</xref>, and his son <xref refid="1627062" ty="1" topicid="224416" tocid="">Gallienus</xref> issued an edict of toleration restoring confiscated churches and cemeteries.

                  </thumbasm>Beginning in February 303, the church faced the worst of all persecutions under the co-emperors <xref refid="1627063" ty="1" topicid="164042" tocid="">Diocletian</xref> and <xref refid="1627064" ty="1" topicid="223951" tocid="">Galerius</xref>. The reasons for this persecution are uncertain, but they have been ascribed, among other things, to the influence of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223951" tocid="">Galerius</xref>, a fanatic follower of the traditional Roman religion; Diocletian’s own devotion to traditional religion and his desire to use <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">Roman religion</xref> to restore complete unity in the empire; and the fear of an alienation of rebellious armies from emperor worship. After Diocletian’s retirement, Galerius continued the persecutions until 311, when he was stricken by a painful disease, described in exquisite detail by the church historian <xref refid="1766779" ty="1" topicid="196614" tocid="">Eusebius</xref>, who believed it was an act of revenge by the Christian God. Galerius died shortly after ending the persecutions. The situation of the early church improved further the following year, when the emperor <xref refid="1627065" ty="1" topicid="133873" tocid="">Constantine</xref>, prior to a battle against a rival emperor, experienced a vision of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="144028" tocid="">cross</xref> in the heavens with the legend “In this sign, conquer.” <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="133825" tocid="">Constantine</xref>’s victory led to his eventual conversion to Christianity. In 313, the joint emperors Constantine and Licinius issued the <xref refid="1627066" ty="1" topicid="382119" tocid="">Edict of Milan</xref>, a manifesto of toleration, which, among other things, granted Christians full legal rights.

                <p>
                  The persecutions had two lasting consequences. Although the blood of the martyrs, as contemporaries declared, had helped the church to grow, schism eventually arose with those who had yielded to imperial pressure. Groups such as the <xref refid="1627067" ty="1" topicid="169009" tocid="">Donatists</xref> in North Africa, for example, refused to recognize as Christians those who had sacrificed to the emperor or turned over holy books during the persecutions.

                  The attitude of the earliest Christians toward paganism and the imperial government was complicated by their close association with Greco-Roman literary and artistic culture: it was difficult to attack the former without seeming to criticize the latter. Nevertheless, the Christian opinion of other religions (except Judaism) was generally very negative.

                  Many Christians also rejected the literary traditions of the classical world, denouncing the immoral and unethical behaviour of the deities and heroes of ancient myth and literature. Reflecting this position, Tertullian once asked, “What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?” Despite this hostility, many Christians recognized the value of ancient letters. St. Paul could quote such pagan poets as <xref refid="1627084" ty="1" topicid="32161" tocid="">Aratus</xref>, <xref refid="1627083" ty="1" topicid="374651" tocid="">Menander</xref>, and <xref refid="1627081" ty="1" topicid="190020" tocid="">Epimenides</xref>. Clement of Rome cited the dramatists <xref refid="1627080" ty="1" topicid="554733" tocid="">Sophocles</xref> and <xref refid="1627082" ty="1" topicid="195618" tocid="">Euripides</xref>. Educated Christians shared this literary tradition with educated <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">pagans</xref>. The defenders of Christianity against pagan attack (especially Justin Martyr and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement of Alexandria</xref> in the 2nd century) welcomed classical philosophy and literature; they wished only to reject all polytheistic myth and cult and all metaphysical and ethical doctrines irreconcilable with Christian belief (e.g., Stoic materialism and Platonic doctrines of the transmigration of souls and the eternity of the world). <xref refid="1627086" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement of Alexandria</xref>, the second known head of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99329" tocid="">catechetical school</xref> at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14441" tocid="">Alexandria</xref>, possessed a wide erudition in the main classics and knew the works of Plato and <xref refid="1627085" ty="1" topicid="270219" tocid="">Homer</xref> intimately. His successor at Alexandria, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref>, showed less interest in literary and aesthetic matters but was a greater scholar and thinker; he first applied the methods of Alexandrian philology to the text of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="64396" tocid="">Bible</xref>. Augustine held that although <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="120225" tocid="">classical literature</xref> contained superstitious imaginings, it included references to moral truths and learning that could be used in the service of God. The great church father compared classical literature to the gold of the Egyptians, which God permitted the Hebrews to use on their journey to the Promised Land even though it had once been used in pagan religious practice.

The artists also adapted conventional pagan forms (good shepherd; praying persons with hands uplifted). Fishing scenes, doves, and lyres also were popular. In themselves neutral, they carried special meaning to the Christians.

His foundation of Constantinople (conceived to be the new Rome) as a Christian city untainted by pagan religion profoundly affected the future political and ecclesiastical structure of the empire and the church.

                Constantine completely altered the relationship between the church and the imperial government, thereby beginning a process that eventually made Christianity the official religion of the empire. Many new converts were won, including those who converted only with the hope of advancing their careers. The church was also faced by a new form of governmental interference when Constantine presided at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413817" tocid="">Council of Nicaea</xref>, which addressed the <xref refid="1627196" ty="1" topicid="34124" tocid="">Arian</xref> controversy (a debate between <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34795" tocid="">Arius</xref> and Athanasius and their followers over the nature of the Son of God); the council provided the definition of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son that is still accepted by most Christians today. Although Nicaea spoke against <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34124" tocid="">Arianism</xref>, which maintained that the Son is a created being and not equal to God the Father, Constantine in later life leaned toward it, and his successor, <xref refid="1766789" ty="1" topicid="134089" tocid="">Constantius II</xref>, was openly Arian. Despite this turmoil, and the outright hostility toward Christianity of the emperor <xref refid="1627197" ty="1" topicid="307781" tocid="">Julian the Apostate</xref> (reigned 361–363), the church survived, and the adherents of the traditional Roman religion relapsed into <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="119219" tocid="">passive resistance</xref>. The quietly mounting pressure against paganism in the 4th century culminated in the decrees of Emperor <xref refid="1627198" ty="1" topicid="590747" tocid="">Theodosius I</xref> (reigned 379–395), who made Catholic Christianity the official religion of the empire and who closed many pagan temples. By the end of the 4th century, therefore, Christianity had been transformed from a persecuted sect to the dominant faith of the empire, in the process becoming intertwined with the imperial government.

                The link between <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref> was expressed in the civil dignity and insignia granted to bishops, who also began to be entrusted with ambassadorial roles. Constantine himself appointed bishops, and he and his successors convened councils of bishops to address important matters of the faith. By 400 the patriarch of Constantinople (to his avowed embarrassment) enjoyed precedence at court before all civil officials. The emperors issued a number of rulings that afforded greater privilege and responsibility to the bishops, enhancing their position in both church and society. The close relations between the empire and the church in the 4th century were reflected in the writings of <xref refid="1766793" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">Ambrose</xref> (bishop of Milan, 374–397), who used “Roman” and “Christian” almost as synonyms.

                  Until about 250, most Western Christian leaders (e.g., Irenaeus and Hippolytus) spoke Greek, not Latin. The main Latin theology came primarily from such figures as Tertullian and Cyprian (bishop of Carthage, 248–258) rather than from any figure in Rome. Tertullian wrote <e>Against Praxeas</e>, in which he discussed the doctrines of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="605512" tocid="">Trinity</xref> and the person of Christ. But in 251 Novatian’s schism at Rome diverted interest away from speculative theology to juridical questions about the membership of the church and the validity of sacraments. Differences of opinion over similar issues in the 4th century led to a schism between Rome and the churches of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418538" tocid="">North Africa</xref>. The <xref refid="1627278" ty="1" topicid="169009" tocid="">Donatist</xref> controversy, which raised questions about the validity of the sacraments, dominated all North African church life. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="148534" tocid="">Cyprian</xref> and the Donatists said that the validity of the sacraments depended on the worthiness of the minister; Rome and North African Christians in communion with Rome said that it did not, because the sacraments received their validity from Christ, not man. Much of the great theologian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine’s</xref> energies as bishop of Hippo (from 396 to 430) went into trying to settle the Donatist issue, in which he finally despaired of rational argument and reluctantly came to justify the use of limited coercion.

The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413817" tocid="">Council of Nicaea</xref> (325) condemned Arianism and affirmed the Son of God to be identical in essence with the Father.

                  During the next 250 years the Byzantine emperors and patriarchs desperately sought to reconcile the Monophysites.

                <p>Along with these developments in higher theology, various forms of religious devotion emerged. One of the more important was the “cult of the saints,” the public veneration of saints and its related shrines and rituals. Shrines were erected in honour of local holy men and women and those who had suffered for the faith. The saints were recognized as the special representatives of God and were thought to be vehicles for his miraculous power. The shrines became the focus of religious pilgrimage, and the relics of the saints were highly valued.</p>
                <p>
                  The veneration of martyrs and the growth of pilgrimages stimulated liturgical elaboration. Great centres (Jerusalem and Rome, in particular) became models for others, which encouraged regional standardization and cross-fertilization. Though the pattern of the eucharistic liturgy was settled by the 4th century, there were many variant forms, especially of the central prayer called by the Greeks <e>anaphora</e> (“offering”) and by the Latins <e>canon</e> (“prescribed form”). Liturgical prayers of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">Basil of Caesarea</xref> became widely influential in the East. Later, liturgies were ascribed to local saints: Jerusalem’s to St. James, Alexandria’s to St. Mark, and Constantinople’s to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="116479" tocid="">John Chrysostom</xref>. The spirit of Greek liturgies encouraged rich and imaginative prose. Latin style was restrained, with epigrammatic antitheses; and the Roman Church changed from Greek to Latin about <e ty="s">ad</e> 370. The Canon of the Latin <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="368145" tocid="">mass</xref> as used in the 6th century was already close to the form it has since retained.

                  Music also became elaborate, with antiphonal <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="462788" tocid="">psalm chanting</xref>. Some reaction came from those who believed that the music was obscuring the words. Both Athanasius of Alexandria and Augustine defended music on the condition that the sense of the words remained primary in importance. The Latin theologians Ambrose of Milan, <xref refid="1766825" ty="1" topicid="480834" tocid="">Prudentius</xref>, and <xref refid="1766824" ty="1" topicid="214309" tocid="">Venantius Fortunatus</xref> provided Latin hymns of distinction.

                  </thumbasm>The development of church architecture was stimulated by Constantine’s great buildings at Jerusalem and Rome, and his example as a church-builder was emulated by his successors, most notably by Justinian in the 6th century. The exteriors of these churches remained simple, but inside they were richly ornamented with marble and mosaic, the decoration being arranged on a coherent plan to represent the angels and saints in heaven with whom the church on earth was joining for worship. An enormous number of churches built in and after the 4th century have been excavated. The outstanding buildings that survive largely intact, <xref refid="1758598" ty="1" topicid="251562" tocid="">Hagia Sophia</xref> at Constantinople (now Istanbul) and San Vitale at Ravenna in Italy, belong to the age of Justinian.

                <p>
                  The veneration of saints led to the production of a specific category of literature known as <xref refid="1627498" ty="1" topicid="251586" tocid="">hagiography</xref>, which told the story of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="516666" tocid="">saint</xref>’s life. Hagiography was not a biography in the modern sense but was a work of religious devotion that portrayed the saint as a model of Christian virtue. If available, authentic tradition would be used, but hagiographers also drew from a stock of conventional tales about earlier saints that were generally intended to convey a moral lesson. Saints’ lives also contained accounts of the miracles performed by the saints in their lifetimes and at their shrines after their deaths. The lives of saints belong to the poetry of the Middle Ages but are important to the historian as documents of social and religious history.

              <p>
                The old tensions between East and West were sharpened by the quarrels about Chalcedon. In Rome every concession made by Constantinople toward the Monophysites increased the distrust. <xref refid="1766841" ty="1" topicid="308858" tocid="">Justinian</xref>’s condemnation of the Three Chapters (Fifth Council, Constantinople, 553) was forced on a reluctant West, parts of which had been brought back under imperial control by Justinian’s conquests. From the time of Pope Gregory I the papacy—encouraged by the successful mission to the Anglo-Saxons—was looking as much to the Western kingdoms as to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="87186" tocid="">Byzantium</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The growing division between East and West was reinforced by developments outside the church itself. In the 7th century the Eastern Empire fought for its life, first against the Persians and then the Arabs, and the Balkans were occupied by the Slavs. The rise of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295765" tocid="">Islam</xref> had an especially profound impact on the church and East-West relations. The Arab military conquest broke upon the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="87186" tocid="">Byzantine Empire</xref> in 634, just as it was exhausted after defeating Persia. The will to resist was wholly absent. Moreover, the provinces initially overrun, Syria (636) and Egypt (641), were already alienated from the Byzantine government that was persecuting <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="389961" tocid="">Monophysites</xref> in those areas. In 678 and again in 718, the Arabs were at the walls of Constantinople. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="136928" tocid="">Monophysite Copts</xref> in Egypt and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579024" tocid="">Syrian Jacobites</xref> (followers of Jacob Baradaeus) soon found that they enjoyed greater toleration under Muslim Arabs than under Chalcedonian Byzantines. Christian territory from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439645" tocid="">Holy Land</xref> to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="557573" tocid="">Spain</xref> was conquered by the forces of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295507" tocid="">Islam</xref>, and many of the inhabitants of this region eventually converted to the new faith.
              </p>
              <p>
                The submergence of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem under Muslim rule left the patriarch of Constantinople with enhanced authority, which altered the internal dynamic of the Christian community. The attempts of the Byzantine emperors to force the papacy to accept the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="390130" tocid="">Monothelite</xref> (one-will) compromise produced a martyr pope, <xref refid="1766842" ty="1" topicid="366940" tocid="">Martin</xref> (reigned 649–655); the story of his tortures did nothing to make Rome love the Byzantines. When the Monothelite <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="263008" tocid="">heresy</xref> was finally rejected at the Sixth Council (Constantinople, 680–681), the imprudent pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="271104" tocid="">Honorius</xref> (reigned 625–638), who had supported Monothelitism, was expressly condemned, which distressed Roman defenders of papal prerogatives. Greek hostility to the West became explicit in the canons of a council held at Constantinople (<xref refid="1627626" ty="1" topicid="487431" tocid="">Quinisext</xref>, 692) that claimed to have ecumenical status but was not recognized in Rome.
              </p>
              <p>
                The divisions between East and West were heightened by developments in both the Latin and the Greek churches. In 726, the emperor <xref refid="1627627" ty="1" topicid="336200" tocid="">Leo III</xref> the Isaurian, after his successful defense against the Islamic advance, introduced a policy of iconoclasm (destruction of images) to the Byzantine church that was continued and expanded by his son <xref refid="1627628" ty="1" topicid="133956" tocid="">Constantine V</xref>. For much of the rest of the century, the empire was absorbed in the <xref refid="1769958" ty="1" topicid="281492" tocid="">Iconoclastic Controversy</xref>, which became a struggle not only to keep icons, a traditional focus of religious veneration, but also to combat the subjection of the church to the will of the emperor. The greatest champion of icons was <xref refid="1766845" ty="1" topicid="305049" tocid="">John of Damascus</xref>, an Arab monk in Muslim Palestine, who was the author of an encyclopaedic compendium of logic and theology. Within the empire, <xref refid="1766846" ty="1" topicid="590668" tocid="">Theodore Studites</xref>, abbot of the Studium (monastery) near Constantinople, vigorously attacked iconoclasm; he also led a revival of monasticism and stressed the importance of copying manuscripts. His ideals passed to the monastic houses that began to appear on <xref refid="1627636" ty="1" topicid="40993" tocid="">Mount Athos</xref> from 963 onward.
              </p>
              <p>
                The imperial attack on images was severely criticized in the West. Yet, after the Greek iconoclasts were condemned at the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea, 787), the bishops of the Frankish king <xref refid="1627630" ty="1" topicid="106546" tocid="">Charlemagne</xref>, who were not invited to Nicaea and learned of its decrees from a faulty translation, censured the decision at the synod of Frankfurt in Germany (794). Icons were differently evaluated in the Western churches, where holy pictures were viewed as devotional aids, not—as was the case in the East—virtually sacramental media of salvation. The bishops of the Frankish church also added to the creed the <xref refid="1778057" ty="1" topicid="206865" tocid="">

                The hostility between the iconoclast emperors and the popes encouraged the 8th-century popes to seek a protector.

The Ottos, accustomed to the tradition in which great landowners built and owned the churches on their estates as private property, treated Rome and all important sees in this spirit.

Manuscripts during the Carolingian period were often bound with covers of intricate ivory and metalwork of superb finesse. Great buildings, notably the palace complex at Aachen, also began to emerge, partly based on Byzantine models, such as the churches at Ravenna. The Ottonian renaissance in Germany encouraged even more confidently the erection of church buildings, producing such masterpieces as the surviving cathedrals at Hildesheim and Spires and setting out a characteristically German style of architecture; it also continued the Carolingian tradition of manuscript illumination.

                  The end of iconoclasm (843) left a legacy of faction. Ignatius, patriarch of Constantinople intermittently from 847 to 877, was exiled by the government in 858 and replaced by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="457678" tocid="">Photius</xref>, a scholarly layman who was head of the imperial chancery—he was elected patriarch and ordained within six days.

Nicholas was angered by Byzantine missions among the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="84067" tocid="">Bulgars</xref>, whom he regarded as belonging to his sphere. When Nicholas wrote to the Bulgars attacking Greek practices, Photius replied by accusing the West of heretically altering the creed in saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son (<e>

The Greeks resented the papal demands, and when Ignatius died in 877 Photius quietly became patriarch again. Rome (at that moment needing Byzantine military support against Muslims in Sicily and southern Italy) reluctantly agreed to recognize Photius, but on the condition of an apology and of the withdrawal of Greek missions to the Bulgars. Photius acknowledged Rome as the first see of Christendom, discreetly said nothing explicitly against the <e>

                <p>The main issue in the Photian schism was whether Rome possessed monarchical power of jurisdiction over all churches (as Nicholas and Adrian held), or whether Rome was the senior of five semi-independent patriarchates (as Photius and the Greeks thought) and therefore could not canonically interfere with the internal affairs of another patriarchate.</p>

              A major factor in the consolidation and expansion of Christianity in the West was the growth in the prestige and power of the bishop of Rome. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="469994" tocid="">Pope</xref> Leo I the Great made the primacy of the Roman bishop explicit both in theory and in practice and must be counted as one of the most important figures in the history of the centralization of authority in the church. The next such figure was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Gregory I</xref> the Great, whose work shaped the worship, the thought, and the structure of the church as well as its temporal wealth and power. Although some of Gregory’s successors advocated papal primacy, it was the popes of the 11th century and thereafter who sought to exploit claims of papal authority over the church hierarchy and over all Christians.

            <p>
              Even while still a part of the universal church, Byzantine Christianity had become increasingly isolated from the West by difference of language, culture, politics, and religion and followed its own course in shaping its heritage. The Eastern churches never had so centralized a polity as did the church in the West but developed the principle of the administrative independence or “autocephaly” of each national church. During the centuries when Western culture was striving to domesticate the German tribes, Constantinople, probably the most civilized city in Christendom, blended classical and Christian elements with a refinement that expressed itself in philosophy, the arts, statecraft, jurisprudence, and scholarship. A thinker such as <xref refid="1766981" ty="1" topicid="481172" tocid="">Michael Psellus</xref> in the 11th century, who worked in several of these fields, epitomizes this synthesis. It was from Byzantine rather than from Roman missionaries that Christianity came to most of the Slavic tribes, including some who eventually sided with Rome rather than Constantinople; Byzantium was also the victim of Muslim aggressions throughout the period known in the West as the Middle Ages. Following the pattern established by the emperors Constantine and Justinian, the relation between <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref> in the Byzantine empire coordinated the two in such a way as to sometimes subject the life and even the teaching of the church to the decisions of the temporal ruler—the phenomenon often, though imprecisely, termed caesaropapism.

            <p>All these differences between the Eastern and Western parts of the church, both the religious differences and those that were largely cultural or political, came together to cause the schism between the two. The break in 1054 was followed by further evidences of alienation—in the 13th century, in the sack of Constantinople by Western Christians in 1204 and the establishment of the Latin patriarchate there; and in the 15th century, after the failure of the union of Florence and after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453.</p>

                Conflict with the East was both a cause and an effect of the distinctive development of Western Christianity during the Middle Ages. If popes Leo I and Gregory I may be styled the architects of the medieval papacy, popes <xref refid="1766982" ty="1" topicid="245604" tocid="">Gregory VII</xref> (reigned 1073–85) and <xref refid="1766983" ty="1" topicid="288633" tocid="">Innocent III</xref> (reigned 1198–1216) should be called its master builders. Gregory VII reformed both the church and the papacy from within, establishing the canonical and moral authority of the papal office when it was threatened by corruption and attack; in the pontificate of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="288633" tocid="">Innocent III</xref> the papal claims to universality reached their zenith at all levels of the life of the church. Significantly, both these popes were obliged to defend the papacy against the Holy Roman emperor and other temporal rulers. The battle between the church and the empire is a persistent theme in the history of medieval Christianity. Both the involvement of the church in secular affairs and the participation of temporal rulers in the <xref refid="1766984" ty="1" topicid="144695" tocid="">Crusades</xref> can be read as variations on this theme. Preoccupied as they usually are with the history of the church as an institution and with the life and thought of the leaders of the church, the documentary sources of knowledge about medieval Christianity make it difficult for the social historian to descry “the religion of the common man” during this period. Both the “age of faith” depicted by neo-Gothic Romanticism and the “Dark Ages” depicted by secularist and Protestant polemics are gross oversimplifications of history. Faith there was during the Middle Ages, and intellectual darkness and superstition too; but only that historical judgment of medieval Christianity is valid that discerns how subtly faith and superstition can be blended in human piety and thought.

Scholastic theology was an effort to harmonize the doctrinal traditions inherited from the Fathers of the early church with the intellectual achievements of classical antiquity—in other words, to create a synthesis of faith and reason. Because many of the early Fathers both in the East and in the West had developed their theologies under the influence of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409036" tocid="">Neoplatonism</xref>, the recovery of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34560" tocid="">Aristotle</xref>—first through the influence of Aristotelian philosophers and theologians among the Muslims, and eventually, with help from Byzantium, through translation and study of the authentic texts of Aristotle himself—caused a profound transformation in the methodology and substance of medieval thought. Because it combined fidelity to Scripture and tradition with a positive, though critical, attitude toward the “natural” mind, Scholasticism is a landmark both in the history of Christianity and in the history of Western culture and a symbol of the Christianization of society and culture.

The several parties of the <xref refid="1766989" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> may be conveniently classified according to the extent of their protest against medieval theology, piety, and polity. The Anglican Reformers, as well as <xref refid="1766987" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Martin Luther</xref> and his movement, were, in general, the most conservative in their treatment of the Roman Catholic tradition; <xref refid="1766988" ty="1" topicid="90247" tocid="">John Calvin</xref> and his followers were less conservative; the Anabaptists and related groups were least conservative of all. Despite their deep differences, almost all the various Reformation movements were characterized by an emphasis upon the Bible, as distinguished from the church or its tradition, as the authority in religion; by an insistence upon the sovereignty of free grace in the forgiveness of sins; by a stress upon faith alone, without works, as the preconditions of acceptance with God; and by the demand that the laity assume a more significant place in both the work and the worship of the church.

                The Reformation envisaged neither schism within the church nor the dissolution of the Christian culture that had developed for more than a millennium. But when the Reformation was over, both the church and the culture had been radically transformed. In part this transformation was the effect of the Reformation; in part it was the cause of the Reformation. The voyages of discovery, the beginnings of a capitalist economy, the rise of modern nationalism, the dawn of the scientific age, the culture of the Renaissance—all these factors, and others besides, helped to break up the “medieval synthesis.” Among these factors, however, the Reformation was one of the most important and, certainly for the history of Christianity, the most significant. For the consequences of the Reformation, not in intention but in fact, were a divided Christendom and a secularized West. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholicism</xref>, no less than Protestantism, has developed historically in the modern world as an effort to adapt historic forms to the implications of these consequences.

              Paradoxically, the end of “established Christianity” in the old sense resulted in the most rapid and most widespread expansion in the history of Christianity.

              During the formative period of modern Western history, roughly from the beginning of the 16th to the middle of the 18th century, Christianity participated in many of the movements of cultural and political expansion. The explorers of the New World were followed closely by missionaries—that is, when the two were not in fact identical. Protestant and Roman Catholic clergymen were prominent in politics, letters, and science. Although the rationalism of the <xref refid="1766990" ty="1" topicid="188441" tocid="">Enlightenment</xref> alienated many people from the Christian faith, especially among the intellectuals of the 17th and 18th centuries, those who were alienated often kept a loyalty to the figure of Jesus or to the teachings of the Bible even when they broke with traditional forms of Christian doctrine and life. Citing the theological conflicts of the Reformation and the political conflicts that followed upon these as evidence of the dangers of religious intolerance, representatives of the Enlightenment gradually introduced disestablishment, toleration, and religious liberty into most Western countries; in this movement they were joined by Christian individuals and groups that advocated religious freedom not out of indifference to dogmatic truth but out of a concern for the free decision of personal faith.

              In alliance with the spirit of the Enlightenment, the so-called “democratic” revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries aided this process of undermining Christianity. Roman Catholicism in France, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Eastern Orthodoxy</xref> in Russia, and Protestantism in former European colonies in Africa and Asia were identified—by their enemies if not also by themselves—as part of the ancien régime and were nearly swept away with it. As the discoveries of science proceeded, they clashed with old and cherished notions about the doctrine of creation, many of which were passionately supported by various leaders of organized Christianity. The age of the revolutions—political, economic, technological, intellectual—was an age of crisis for Christianity. The critical methods of modern scholarship, despite their frequent attacks upon traditional Christian ideas, helped to produce editions of the chief documents of the Christian faith—the Bible and the writings of the Fathers and Reformers—and to arouse an unprecedented interest in the history of the church. The 19th century was called the great century in the history of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="385426" tocid="">Christian missions</xref>, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. By the very force of their attacks upon Christianity, the critics of the church helped to arouse within the church new apologists for the faith, who creatively reinterpreted it in relation to the new philosophy and science of the modern period. The 20th century saw additional challenges to the Christian cause in the form of totalitarianism, of resurgent world religions, and of indifference. Both the relation of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref> and the missionary program of the churches thus demanded reconsideration. But the 20th century also saw renewed efforts to heal the schisms within Christendom. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178836" tocid="">ecumenical movement</xref> began within Protestantism and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="24861" tocid="">Anglicanism</xref>, eventually included some of the Eastern Orthodox churches, and, especially since the second <xref refid="1766991" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Vatican Council</xref> (1962–65), has engaged the sympathetic attention of Roman Catholicism as well.

Virtually no nation remained unaffected by the activities of Christian missionaries, although in many countries Christians are only a small fraction of the total population.

              <p>
                The Roman Catholics in the world outnumber all other Christians combined. They are organized in an intricate system that spans the structure of the church from the local parish to the papacy. Under the central authority of the papacy, the church is divided into dioceses, whose bishops act in the name and by the authority of the pope but retain administrative freedom within their individual jurisdictions. Similarly, the parish priest stands as the executor of papal and diocesan directives. Alongside the diocesan organization and interacting with it is a chain of orders, congregations, and societies; all of them are, of course, subject to the pope, but they are not directly responsible to the bishop as are the local parishes. It would, however, be a mistake to interpret the polity of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref> in so purely an organizational manner as this. For Roman Catholic polity rests upon a mandate that is traced to the action of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> himself, when he invested Peter and, through Peter, his successors with the power of the keys in the church. Christ is the invisible head of his church, and by his authority the pope is the visible head.
              </p>
              <p>
                This interpretation of the origin and authority of the church determines both the attitude of Roman Catholicism to the rest of Christendom and its relation to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social order</xref>. Believing itself to be the true church of Jesus Christ on earth, it cannot deal with other Christian traditions as equals without betraying its very identity. This does not mean, however, that anyone outside the visible fellowship of the Roman Catholic Church cannot be saved; nor does it preclude the presence of “vestiges of the church” in the other Christian bodies. At the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">second Vatican Council</xref> the Roman Catholic Church strongly affirmed its ties with its “separated brethren” both in Eastern Orthodoxy and in the several Protestant churches. As the true church of Christ on earth, the Roman Catholic Church also believes itself responsible for the proclamation of the will of God to organized society and to the state. The church asserts its fundamental obligation, as the “light of the world” to which the revelation of God has been entrusted, to address the meaning of that revelation and of the moral law to the nations, and to work for a social and political order in which both revelation and the moral law can function.
              </p>
              <p>The understanding that Roman Catholicism has of itself, its interpretation of the proper relation between the church and the state, and its attitude toward other Christian traditions are all based upon Roman Catholic doctrine. In great measure this doctrine is identical with that confessed by orthodox Christians of every label and consists of the Bible, the dogmatic heritage of the ancient church as laid down in the historic creeds and in the decrees of the ecumenical councils, and the theological work of the great doctors of the faith in the East and West. If, therefore, the presentation of the other Christian traditions in this article compares them with Roman Catholicism, this comparison has a descriptive rather than a normative function; for, to a considerable degree, Protestantism and Eastern Orthodoxy have often defined themselves in relation to Roman Catholicism. In addition, most Christians past and present do have a shared body of beliefs about God, Christ, and the way of salvation.</p>
              <p>
                Roman Catholic doctrine is more than this shared body of beliefs, as is the doctrine of each of the Christian groups. It is necessary here to mention only the three distinctive Roman Catholic doctrines that achieved definitive formulation during the 19th and 20th centuries: the infallibility of the pope, the immaculate conception, and bodily assumption of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Virgin Mary</xref>. On most other major issues of Christian doctrine, Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are largely in agreement, while Protestantism differs from both Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism on several issues. For example, Roman Catholic theology defines and numbers the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515366" tocid="">sacraments</xref> differently from Orthodox theology; but, over against Protestantism, Roman Catholic doctrine insists, as does Eastern Orthodoxy, upon the centrality of the seven sacraments—baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, extreme unction, penance, matrimony, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="431536" tocid="">holy orders</xref>—as channels of divine grace.

              <p>
                Separated from the West, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox churches</xref> of the East have developed their own way for half of Christian history. Each national church is autonomous. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178827" tocid="">“ecumenical patriarch” of Constantinople</xref> is not the Eastern pope but merely the first in honour among equals in jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy interprets the primacy of Peter and therefore that of the pope similarly, denying the right of the pope to speak and act for the entire church by himself, without a church council and without his episcopal colleagues. Because of this polity Eastern Orthodoxy has identified itself more intimately with national cultures and with national regimes than has Roman Catholicism. Therefore the history of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church–state</xref> relations in the East has been very different from the Western development, because the church in the East has sometimes tended toward the extreme of becoming a mere instrument of national policy while the church in the West has sometimes tended toward the extreme of attempting to dominate the state. The history of ecumenical relations between Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism during the 20th century was also different from the history of Protestant–Roman Catholic relations. While keeping alive their prayer for an eventual healing of the schism with the Latin Church, some of the Orthodox churches have established communion with Anglicanism and with the Old Catholic Church and have participated in the conferences and organizations of the World Council of Churches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doctrinal authority for Eastern Orthodoxy resides in the Scriptures, the ancient creeds, the decrees of the first seven ecumenical councils, and the tradition of the church. In addition to the issues mentioned in the discussion of Roman Catholicism above, the chief dogmatic difference between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox thought is on the question of the procession of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> from the Father and from the Son, or the <e>Filioque</e>.
              </p>
              <p>
                But “orthodoxy,” in the Eastern use of the term, means primarily not a species of doctrine but a species of worship. The <xref refid="1766993" ty="1" topicid="433434" tocid="">Feast of Orthodoxy</xref> on the first Sunday of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336104" tocid="">Lent</xref> celebrates the end of the iconoclastic controversies and the restoration to the churches of the icons, which are basic to Orthodox piety. In Orthodox churches (as well as in those Eastern churches that have reestablished communion with Rome), the most obvious points of divergence from general Western practice are the Byzantine liturgy, the right of the clergy to marry before ordination, though bishops may not be married, and the administration to the laity of both bread and wine in the Eucharist at the same time by the method of intinction.

                Formulating a definition of Protestantism that would include all its varieties has long been the despair of Protestant historians and theologians, for there is greater diversity within Protestantism than there is between some forms of Protestantism and some non-Protestant Christianity. For example, a high-church Anglican or Lutheran has more in common with an Orthodox theologian than with a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52364" tocid="">Baptist</xref> theologian. Amid this diversity, however, it is possible to define Protestantism formally as non-Roman Western Christianity and to divide most of Protestantism into four major confessions or confessional families—Lutheran, Anglican, Reformed, and Free Church.

                  The largest of these non-Roman Catholic denominations in the West is the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran Church</xref>. The Lutheran churches in Germany, in Scandinavian countries, and in the Americas are distinct from one another in polity, but almost all of them are related through various national and international councils, of which the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352070" tocid="">Lutheran World Federation</xref> is the most comprehensive. Doctrinally, Lutheranism sets forth its distinctive position in the <xref refid="1766994" ty="1" topicid="131222" tocid="">Book of Concord</xref>, especially in the <xref refid="1766995" ty="1" topicid="42785" tocid="">Augsburg Confession</xref>. A long tradition of theological scholarship has been responsible for the development of this position into many and varied doctrinal systems. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Martin Luther</xref> moved conservatively in this reform of the Roman Catholic liturgy, and the Lutheran Church, though it has altered many of his liturgical forms, has remained a liturgically traditional church. Most of the Lutheran churches of the world have participated in the ecumenical movement and are members of the <xref refid="1766996" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref>, but Lutheranism has not moved very often across its denominational boundaries to establish full communion with other bodies. The prominence of Lutheran mission societies in the history of missions during the 18th and 19th centuries gave an international character to the Lutheran Church; so did the development of strong Lutheran churches in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">North America</xref>, where the traditionally German and Scandinavian membership of the church was gradually replaced by a more cosmopolitan constituency.

Like Lutheranism, <xref refid="1766999" ty="1" topicid="24861" tocid="">Anglicanism</xref> has striven to retain the Roman Catholic tradition of liturgy and piety; after the middle of the 19th century the <xref refid="1766997" ty="1" topicid="436527" tocid="">Oxford movement</xref> argued the essential Catholic character of Anglicanism in the restoration of ancient liturgical usage and doctrinal belief. Although the Catholic revival also served to rehabilitate the authority of tradition in Anglican theology generally, great variety continued to characterize the theologians of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1310018" tocid="">Anglican Communion</xref>. Anglicanism is set off from most other non-Roman Catholic churches in the West by its retention of and its insistence upon the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30289" tocid="">apostolic succession</xref> of ordaining bishops. The Anglican claim to this <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30289" tocid="">apostolic succession</xref>, despite its repudiation by Pope <xref refid="1767000" ty="1" topicid="336286" tocid="">Leo XIII</xref> in 1896, has largely determined the role of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="187819" tocid="">Church of England</xref> in the discussions among the churches. Anglicanism has often taken the lead in inaugurating such discussions, but in such statements as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="328591" tocid="">Lambeth Quadrilateral</xref> it has demanded the presence of the historic episcopate as a prerequisite to the establishment of full communion. During the 19th and 20th centuries many leaders of Anglican thought were engaged in finding new avenues of communication with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="287204" tocid="">industrial society</xref> and with the modern intellectual. The strength of Anglicanism in the New World and in the younger churches of Asia and Africa confronted this communion with the problem of deciding its relation to new forms of Christian life in these new cultures. As its centuries-old reliance upon the establishment in England was compelled to retrench, Anglicanism discovered new ways of exerting its influence and of expressing its message.

In Britain and in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref> they have usually taken their name from their distinctive polity and have been called Presbyterian. They are distinguished from both Lutheranism and Anglicanism by the thoroughness of their separation from Roman Catholic patterns of liturgy, piety, and even doctrine. Reformed theology has tended to emphasize the sole authority of the Bible with more rigour than has characterized the practice of Anglican or Lutheran thought, and it has looked with deeper suspicion upon the symbolic and sacramental traditions of the Catholic centuries. Perhaps because of its stress upon biblical authority, Reformed Protestantism has sometimes tended to produce a separation of churches along the lines of divergent doctrine or polity, by contrast with the inclusive or even latitudinarian churchmanship of the more traditionalistic Protestant communions. This understanding of the authority of the Bible has also led Reformed Protestantism to its characteristic interpretation of the relation between church and state, sometimes labeled <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590558" tocid="">theocratic</xref>, according to which those charged with the proclamation of the revealed will of God in the Scriptures (i.e., the ministers) are to address this will also to civil magistrates; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="484034" tocid="">Puritanism</xref> in England and America gave classic expression to this view. As the church is “reformed according to the Word of God,” so the lives of the individuals in the church are to conform to the Word of God; hence the Reformed tradition has assigned great prominence to the cultivation of moral uprightness among its members. During the 20th century most of the Reformed churches of the world took an active part in the ecumenical movement.

                  In the 19th century the term <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218180" tocid="">Free churches</xref> was applied in Great Britain to those Protestant bodies that did not conform to the establishment, such as <xref refid="1767001" ty="1" topicid="132545" tocid="">Congregationalists</xref>, <xref refid="1767002" ty="1" topicid="378415" tocid="">Methodists</xref>, and <xref refid="1767003" ty="1" topicid="52364" tocid="">Baptists</xref> (and Presbyterians in England); but since that time it has come into usage among the counterparts to these churches in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref>, where each of them has grown larger than its British parent body. Just as the Reformed denominations go beyond both Anglicanism and Lutheranism in their independence of Roman Catholic traditions and usages, so the Free churches have tended to reject some of the Roman Catholic remnants also in classical Presbyterian worship and theology. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52364" tocid="">Baptists</xref> and Congregationalists see the local congregation of gathered believers as the most nearly adequate visible representation of Christ’s people on earth. The Baptist requirement of free personal decision as a prerequisite of membership in the congregation leads to the restriction of baptism to believers (i.e., those who have made and confessed such a decision of faith) and therefore to the repudiation of infant baptism; this in turn leads to the restriction of Communion at the Lord’s Supper to those who have been properly baptized. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378415" tocid="">Methodism</xref> the Free-church emphasis upon the place of religious experience and upon personal commitment leads to a deep concern for moral perfection in the individual and for moral purity in the community.

Emphasizing as they do the need for the continuing reformation of the church, the Free churches have, in most (though not all) cases, entered into the activities of interchurch cooperation and have provided leadership and support for the ecumenical movement. This cooperation—as well as the course of their own historical development from spontaneous movements to ecclesiastical institutions possessing many of the features that the founders of the Free churches had originally found objectionable in the establishment—has made the question of their future role in Christendom a central concern of Free churches on both sides of the Atlantic.

                  In addition to these major divisions of Protestantism, there are other churches and movements not so readily classifiable; some of them are quite small, but others number millions of members.

They illustrate also how elusive is the precise demarcation of Christendom, even for those observers whose definition of normative Christianity is quite exact.

                From the first, church teaching has occurred in several contexts and for several purposes: it happens when the gospel is newly preached to people who have not heard it before (evangelism), when those who accept the message are instructed in preparation for baptism (catechesis), when the believing and baptized communities gather for worship (liturgy), and when application is sought to daily life (ethics). Teaching may be specially required for the sake of clarification and consolidation, as when distortions threaten within (aversion of heresy), when the faith is under attack from outside (apologetics), when linguistic or epistemological shifts over time hinder intelligibility or change the terms of reference (restatement), or when geographical expansion prompts a more local expression (inculturation). The teaching may vary in the weight of the authority it claims and is granted, ranging from the most solemn definitions of supervisory bodies (dogma) through a broadly prevalent but internally somewhat differentiated “common mind” (consensus) to the works of individual thinkers (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590855" tocid="">theology</xref>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The most stable and widely recognized teaching is that preserved in the ancient <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142374" tocid="">creeds</xref>—the <xref refid="1767831" ty="1" topicid="30242" tocid="">Apostles’ Creed</xref> and the <xref refid="1767832" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref>—that are transmitted in the worship of the churches and expounded in their confessions (<xref refid="1880984" ty="3" topicid="115240" tocid="260802">symbolics</xref>). The agreed doctrine may sometimes have been achieved only through a period of maturing reflection and debate, and the continuation of these processes within the established parameters is not excluded (development). In the course of history, however, differences concerning accepted teaching sometimes became so serious that communities divided over them (schism). The divided communities may continue their conversation in tones that range from the persuasive to the polemical (controversy). In the 20th century, determined efforts on the part of several Christian communions were made to overcome the doctrinal differences between them with the aim of restoring ecclesiastical unity (ecumenism).

              <p>Thus there are many aspects to the question of Christian doctrine, and in what follows they will be treated in the sequence just outlined: the permanent basis, the perennial functions, the levels of authority, the stable pattern, and the institutional vicissitudes.</p>

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                In his First <xref refid="1629007" ty="1" topicid="137622" tocid="">Letter to the Corinthians</xref>, the apostle <xref refid="1769103" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> summarized the gospel he himself had received and then preached to them, in which they now stood for their salvation: “that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures [that is, the Old Testament], and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve…” (15:1–8). The speeches in the <xref refid="1629008" ty="1" topicid="4674" tocid="">Acts of the Apostles</xref> are the basis of the following synthesis, by the biblical scholar C.H. Dodd, of the early apostolic preaching, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="315576" tocid="">kerygma</xref> (from the Greek term for a herald’s proclamation); in Dodd’s synthesis, the story of Jesus is located a little more fully in God’s history with Israel and with the entire human race:<qt>
                  <qtpara>
                    The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref> had made its appearance with the coming of the Messiah; His works of power and His ‘new teaching with authority’ had provided evidence of the presence of God among men; His death ‘according to the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God’ had marked the end of the old order, and his resurrection and exaltation had definitely inaugurated the new age, characterized, as the prophets had foretold, by the outpouring of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> upon the people of God. It remained only for the new order to be consummated by the return of Christ in glory to judge the quick and the dead and to save His own from the wrath to come.
                  </qtpara>
                </qt>
              </p>
              <p>Moreover, according to Dodd, “the kerygma always closes with an appeal for repentance, the offer of forgiveness and of the Holy Spirit, and the promise of ‘salvation,’ that is, of ‘the life of the Age to come,’ to those who enter the elect community.”</p>
              <p>
                Embedded in the New Testament also are certain short formulas used by believers to confess their faith (<e>homologein</e>): “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 12:3), “Jesus is the Son of God” (1 John 4:15), and Peter’s “You are the Christ” (Mark 8:29) and Thomas’s “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28). Confessions of faith were sometimes sung when the Christians assembled for worship (Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16); Paul seems to use quotations from such hymns in arguments in his letters to the Philippians (2:5–11) and Colossians (1:15–20). The earthly worship of the church is probably the immediate source for the heavenly songs of the Apocalypse (Revelation 4:8–11; 5:9–10, 13–14; 7:9–12; 11:16–18; 19:1–8).
              </p>
              <p>
                The fullest apostolic record of the teachings of Jesus is found in narrative form in the Gospels, where his life and sayings are set amid faithful conclusions about who he was and is and what he will still accomplish. Although a degree of diversity in presentation and emphasis is found in the four canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) as a result of the material available to the authors (the Evangelists), the interests of their audience, and the authors’ own interpretations, the overwhelming perception of the church through the centuries has been that the four canonical Gospels are mutually complementary rather than contradictory. Turning from the traditional understanding, modern scholarship for a time maximized the differences among the Gospels, but this was followed by the recovered sense of a complex unity as in fact characteristic of the Scriptures in their entirety (an important record in this regard is the 1993 report of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, <e>The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church</e>).

                The most discursive reflections of the apostolic faith are found in the New Testament epistles, where salvation is at stake in the matter of right belief and right practice. Thus in the <xref refid="1769104" ty="1" topicid="508652" tocid="">Letter to the Romans</xref>, the apostle Paul first shows how worshipping creatures rather than the Creator leads to destruction. He then expounds the redemptive work of God in Christ and shows how those who believe are renewed by the Holy Spirit for life as God means it to be. In the First Letter of John, faith in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284611" tocid="">Incarnation</xref>—that “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh”—is bound up with God’s love for humankind and humankind’s love for God, as well as with human beings’ love for each other, in all of which eternal life consists.

              <p>By the late 2nd century there was widespread agreement among the local churches about which writings were to be reckoned apostolic by virtue of their origin and content, but it was not until the 4th century that the list became settled into what is now known as the “New Testament.” This canon has remained virtually invariable ever since, being drawn on for regular positive teaching and appealed to whenever controversies have arisen. The writings that form it are believed by Christians to have been divinely inspired, whether the mode of inspiration was that of dictation or of a more complex mediation through the human writers’ minds, experiences, and churchly location.</p>

                About 400, <xref refid="1767838" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">St. Augustine</xref> wrote the highly influential <e>De doctrina christiana</e> (<e>On Christian Doctrine</e>), which provides practical guidance for interpreting the faith. The work consists largely of rules for the reading and teaching of Scripture, both Old Testament and New. Augustine emphasized that familiarity with the text, sound philology, and an understanding of the relation between signs and things are all needed, and he demonstrated how different literary genres and figures are to be recognized. <e>De doctrina christiana</e> also showed how difficult passages can be illuminated by clearer ones and how basic axioms, themselves internal to the Scriptures—such as love of God and love of neighbour—should guide the reading of the whole.

                In medieval terms, sacred doctrine (<e>sacra doctrina</e>) is to be read as directly as possible from the sacred page (<e>sacra pagina</e>). Moreover, it is a commonplace—from <xref refid="1629410" ty="1" topicid="592868" tocid="">Thomas à Kempis</xref> (<e>

In other words, the reading of Scripture, whether corporate or individual, is properly done prayerfully by people who have pure hearts and live holy lives. It is such use that permits Scripture to function authoritatively in Christian teaching.

              <p>
                While the New Testament, which sets the terms also for the reading of the Hebrew Scriptures as the promissory and prophetic Old Testament, is consistently held to be the primary witness to the apostolic preaching and a permanent statement of “the faith once delivered to the saints” (Jude 3), there are other possible legacies from the Apostles. Thus <xref refid="1767841" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">Basil of Caesarea</xref>, a 4th-century <xref refid="1770876" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Father</xref> and bishop, claimed that certain practices and expressions not mentioned in the New Testament—such as facing East for prayer, the renunciation of <xref refid="1769108" ty="1" topicid="524816" tocid="">Satan</xref> before baptism, the threefold immersion, the words for invoking the Spirit over the bread and cup—are nevertheless of apostolic origin. In the 16th century, when the Protestant reformers sought to bring the Western church back from what they perceived as departures from Scripture, the <xref refid="1629446" ty="1" topicid="604238" tocid="">Council of Trent</xref> responded with the declaration that equal respect was to be shown to “the truth and discipline contained in the written books and (Latin <e>et</e>) in the unwritten traditions handed down to us, which the Apostles received from the mouth of Christ himself or by the dictation of the Holy Spirit.” As some scholars have argued, the <e>et</e> seemingly left open the question whether oral and practical traditions may add substantially to what is known from the Apostles through the Scriptures or are rather to be viewed as parallel modes for transmitting the same content.

                When the gospel is preached to people for the first time, the hearers usually have some idea of “the divine” in their minds. This idea provides an initial point of contact for the evangelist. According to the <xref refid="1769109" ty="1" topicid="4674" tocid="">Acts of the Apostles</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref>, in addressing the Athenians, noted that their altars included one “to an unknown god.” Whether that designated a supreme deity or simply one who might have been left out, Paul took the opportunity to teach them about “the God who made the world and everything in it, the Lord of heaven and earth.” The Greek poets <xref refid="1767844" ty="1" topicid="190020" tocid="">Epimenides</xref> and <xref refid="1767845" ty="1" topicid="32161" tocid="">Aratus</xref>, he said, had hinted at such a God, “in whom we live and move and have our being” (Epimenides), for “we are indeed his offspring” (Aratus). As such, Paul confirmed, “He is not far from each of us.” The crucial point, however, is that God now “commands all men everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331102" tocid="">judge</xref> the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead.” In this way Paul appealed to what he could in his hearers’ conceptions but brought radical news concerning the will and actions of God in history. The responses of his audience are reported as ranging from scorn through mild curiosity to belief.

                Christian evangelists must often decide which name of the divine they will employ among those used by their hearers. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302999" tocid="">Jesuit</xref> missionaries to China in the 16th and 17th centuries could use <e>tian</e> (simply “heaven,” a Confucian usage), <e>shangdi</e> (“sovereign on high”), and <e>tianzhu</e> or <e>tiandi</e> (“lord of heaven”). <xref refid="1629457" ty="1" topicid="502216" tocid="">Matteo Ricci</xref> (1552–1610) favoured using all three interchangeably.

In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="628349" tocid="">Vietnam</xref>, <xref refid="1629468" ty="1" topicid="501600" tocid="">Alexandre de Rhodes</xref> (1591–1660) rejected the terms <e>but</e> and <e>phat</e> because they were used for the <xref refid="1629469" ty="1" topicid="83105" tocid="">Buddha</xref>, whom he regarded as an idol. Instead he chose the vernacular compound <e>Duc Chua Troi Dat</e> (“noble ruler of heaven and earth”), thus coming close to Acts 17:24 and Luke 10:21. Some missionaries to East Asia resorted to transliterating the Latin <e>Deus</e> (“God”), which had either the advantage or the disadvantage of being an empty container waiting to be filled.

                A modern missionary to India, Lesslie Newbigin (1909–98), recounted how, in preaching to villagers in the south, he would tell stories about Jesus that could not be told about the Hindu gods <xref refid="1629482" ty="1" topicid="546894" tocid="">Shiva</xref>, <xref refid="1629483" ty="1" topicid="630506" tocid="">Vishnu</xref>, or <xref refid="1629485" ty="1" topicid="225299" tocid="">Ganesha</xref>, until gradually their conceptions of the Divine would be changed.

                Christian theological opinions may vary concerning the degree to which an existing idea of the divine needs to be “completed” and the degree to which it needs to be “corrected” through the preaching of the God of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. Features of the previous religion that are affirmed may then be viewed as having constituted a “preparation for the gospel” (<e>praeparatio evangelica</e>), while elements that are rejected as incompatible with Christianity will at least have served as a negative point of contrast. Ultimately, Christians expect that the Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Spirit—will be recognized as the sole true God.

              <headtitle>Catechesis: instructing candidates for baptism</headtitle>
              <p>
                By the 3rd century at the latest, it was normal for two to three years to elapse before an initial inquirer into the gospel might eventually be admitted to the church by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52311" tocid="">baptism</xref>. During this period, the catechumens received instruction in faith and morals and their manner of life was observed. As the time for their baptism drew closer, they were enrolled as “applicants” (<e>competentes</e>), “chosen” (<e>electi</e>), or “destined for illumination” (<e>photizomenoi</e>). There is considerable evidence from the 4th and 5th centuries that those preparing for baptism underwent intensive preparation during the final weeks of their catechumenate. This final period usually coincided with the season that became known as Lent, and baptism was administered on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="176858" tocid="">Easter</xref>. Toward the end of the period of instruction, a dual ceremony took place, in which the words of the creed were orally “handed over” to the candidates (the <e>traditio symboli</e>; “hand over the Creed”) and then, a day or two before Easter, “given back” (the <e>redditio symboli</e>; “give back the Creed”). Thus the candidates had to learn the creed—which the bishop expounded to them—and then be able to repeat it.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the rite is described in an early church order—which most 20th-century scholarship identified with the treatise <e>Apostolic Tradition</e> (<e>c.</e> 215) by <xref refid="1629530" ty="1" topicid="266682" tocid="">Hippolytus of Rome</xref>—the baptism itself took the form of a threefold immersion in water. At each immersion the candidates replied “I believe” to the questions put by the minister: “Do you believe in God the Father almighty? Do you believe in Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who was born of the Holy Spirit and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Virgin Mary</xref>, was crucified under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="460341" tocid="">Pontius Pilate</xref>, and died, and rose the third day alive from the dead, and ascended into the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Father, and will come to judge the living and the dead? Do you believe in the Holy Spirit and the holy church and the resurrection of the flesh?” Following baptism, the new believers participated in the sacrament of the Eucharist for the first time.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the days immediately after Easter, the bishop would give more detailed teaching to the neophytes on the meaning and effect of the sacraments they had just received. Lectures attributed to <xref refid="1769119" ty="1" topicid="148705" tocid="">Cyril of Jerusalem</xref> and to <xref refid="1769120" ty="1" topicid="19014" tocid="">Ambrose</xref> of Milan are still extant. In other places—such as Antioch, where <xref refid="1769118" ty="1" topicid="116479" tocid="">John Chrysostom</xref> taught—these “mystagogical catecheses” were delivered before the initiatory rites were undertaken.
              </p>
              <p>
                As infant baptism gradually became the preponderant practice, verbal instruction around baptism fell out of use, although some of the old ceremonies of the catechumenate continued to be administered in compressed form. Instead, children were taught the faith when they reached the age of reason. In the medieval West, this instruction came to be associated with confirmation, that part of the initiation process which remained for the bishop to do. The parish priest was expected to teach the local children at least the Apostles’ Creed, the <xref refid="1769698" ty="1" topicid="348087" tocid="">Lord’s Prayer</xref>, the <xref refid="1769699" ty="1" topicid="251810" tocid="">Hail Mary</xref>, the sacraments, the <xref refid="1769701" ty="1" topicid="587032" tocid="">Ten Commandments</xref>, and the Seven Beatitudes or some other lessons on the vices and virtues. In the 16th century, Protestant reformers adapted this practice by providing official printed catechisms for use with children, each more or less marked with the doctrinal emphasis brought by the particular reformer. After the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="604238" tocid="">Council of Trent</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref> produced the <e>Catechismus ad Parochos</e> (1566), intended for parish priests rather than immediately for their wards.

              <p>
                Modern educational theory discountenanced rote learning, especially in the form of cut-and-dried questions and answers, and the genre of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99332" tocid="">catechism</xref> became unpopular. Many churches in the West, however, have sought to retrieve the loss of informed faith that has occurred over several generations. In the second half of the 20th century, “adult catechisms” of various literary types were produced for study by individuals or groups; and some churches have tried to introduce a kind of remedial catechumenate on more ancient models.

              <headtitle>Liturgy: the school and feast of faith</headtitle>
              <p>Christians gather regularly for worship, particularly on Sundays and on the great annual festivals. In these assemblies, their faith is directed to God in praise and prayer; it is also exposed to God for strengthening, deepening, and enriching. In the living encounter with God, the content and verbal formulations of faith are shaped, while in turn the tried and accepted teaching of the community provides the basis for each new celebration.</p>
              <p>
                Worship contributed to the evolution of doctrine from the earliest days of Christianity. In the first decade of the 2nd century, the Roman investigator <xref refid="1629531" ty="1" topicid="464843" tocid="">Pliny</xref> reports that the Christians meet “on a fixed day” and “recite a hymn to Christ as to a god.” The experienced presence of the risen and exalted Christ as living Lord is reflected even earlier in such New Testament texts as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref> 18:20 (gathering “in his name” for prayer), Matthew 28:16–20 (Christ’s accompaniment of his Apostles in teaching and baptizing), 1 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="137622" tocid="">Corinthians</xref> 16:22 (the invocation <e>Maranatha</e> as “The Lord has come” or “Our Lord, come”), Philippians 2:9–11 (the bowing of the knee to Jesus and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131927" tocid="">confession</xref> from the tongue that he is Lord), and Revelation 1:4–18 (John’s vision, when he was “in the Spirit on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573790" tocid="">Lord’s Day</xref>,” of Christ standing among seven golden lamp stands and holding seven stars). The practice of worshipping Christ as the Lord, as early Christian and non-Christian sources indicate, was an important part of early Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="504688" tocid="">ritual</xref>, which played a central role in establishing the doctrine of his divine status. In the fierce debates of the 4th century, <xref refid="1769707" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">Athanasius</xref> maintained that the church’s worship of Christ established that he is fully God, for otherwise Christians would commit an unthinkable idolatry.
              </p>
              <p>Influence also traveled in the other direction. From the beginning of the faith, doctrine contributed to the development of patterns of worship and has continued to do so. Theological reflection on Christ’s sovereignty in the present most likely led to belief also in his preexistence as the agent of the Father’s creative work from the very beginning. This belief then found expression in the hymns or other liturgical forms that are echoed at several places in the New Testament: 1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:15–20; and Hebrews 1:1–2, for example.</p>
              <p>
                Church authorities have been keen to ensure that the language used in worship is doctrinally orthodox. The <e>Apostolic Tradition</e>, an early church order, sets out a sample prayer for a newly ordained bishop to use at the Eucharist, saying that it is not necessary that he use exactly these words, “only let his prayer be correct and orthodox.” A similar concern led some North African councils around the year 400 to discourage new compositions. In the Middle Ages, the great metropolitan bishoprics—and even, in the case of <xref refid="1629532" ty="1" topicid="106546" tocid="">Charlemagne</xref>, the imperial court—sought to standardize liturgical forms in their areas. The advent of printing made this easier, and the Protestant reformers issued books for the purpose, either laying down verbally the entire content of the service (as in the Church of England’s <e>

Following the Council of Trent, the Roman see produced a series of books that regulated the words and gestures of the rites down to the last detail (<e>Breviary</e>, 1568; <e>Missal</e>, 1570; <e>Pontifical</e>, 1596; and <e>Ritual</e>, 1614). Less bookish churches have relied more on individual ministers, assuming the fundamental doctrinal soundness of the ministers or their recurrent inspiration by the truth of God or both.

                Wherever sermons are preached to the congregation, a special responsibility rests on the preacher to build the local community up in the Christian faith. The theological assumption is that the entire liturgy is both a school and the feast of faith: in the same act, believers both learn and celebrate the transgenerational faith of the Church into which they grow. This assumption was the motivation of the liturgical revisions and renewals attempted in many Western churches in the second half of the 20th century. An outstanding example is provided by Eucharistic Prayer IV in the Roman Missal of 1969–70, which has been borrowed and adapted by several other churches. Here the words and the ritual actions allow a reappropriation of the entire story of salvation:<qt>

                    Father in heaven, it is right that we should give you thanks and glory: you alone are God, living and true. Through all eternity you live in unapproachable light. Source of life and goodness, you have created all things, to fill your creatures with every blessing and lead all men to the joyful vision of your light. Countless hosts of angels stand before you to do your will; they look upon your splendor and praise you night and day. United with them, and in the name of every creature under heaven, we too praise your glory as we say: Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. Father, we acknowledge your greatness: all your actions show your wisdom and love. You formed man in your own likeness and set him over the whole world to serve you, his creator, and to rule over all creatures. Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship, you did not abandon him to the power of death, but helped all men to seek and find you. Again and again you offered a covenant to man, and through the prophets taught him to hope for salvation. Father, you so loved the world that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. He was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary, a man like us in all things but sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, to prisoners, freedom, and to those in sorrow, joy. In fulfillment of your will he gave himself up to death; but by rising from the dead, he destroyed death and restored life. And that we might live no longer for ourselves but for him, he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father, as his first gift to those who believe, to complete his work on earth and bring us the fullness of grace. Father, may this Holy Spirit sanctify these offerings. Let them become the body and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord as we celebrate the great mystery which he left us as an everlasting covenant. He always loved those who were his own in the world. When the time came for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, he showed the depth of his love. While they were at supper, he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and eat it: This is my body which will be given up for you. In the same way, he took the cup, filled with wine. He gave you thanks, and giving the cup to his disciples, said: Take this, all of you, and drink from it: this is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. It will be shed for you and for all men, so that sins may be forgiven. Do this in memory of me. Let us proclaim the mystery of faith: Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again. Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. We recall Christ’s death, his descent among the dead, his resurrection, and his ascension to your right hand; and, looking forward to his coming in glory, we offer you his body and blood, the acceptable sacrifice which brings salvation to the whole world. Lord, look upon this sacrifice which you have given to your church; and by your Holy Spirit, gather all who share this one bread and one cup into the one <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">body of Christ</xref>, a living sacrifice of praise. Lord, remember those for whom we offer this sacrifice, especially N. our Pope, N. our bishop, and bishops and clergy everywhere. Remember those who take part in this offering, those here present and all your people, and all those who seek you with a sincere heart. Remember those who have died in the peace of Christ and all the dead whose faith is known to you alone. Father, in your mercy grant also to us, your children, to enter into our heavenly inheritance in the company of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and your apostles and saints. Then, in your kingdom, freed from the corruption of sin and death, we shall sing your glory with every creature through Christ our Lord, through whom you give us everything that is good. Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, almighty Father, for ever and ever. Amen.

                So comprehensive was this prayer that the Catholic bishops of France made it the basis for a short popular catechism, <e>Il est grand, le mystère de la foi: Prière et foi de l’Église catholique</e> (1978; “It Is Great, the Mystery of the Faith: The Prayer and Faith of the Catholic Church”).

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="279350" tocid="">Hymns</xref> have been significant vehicles of the Christian faith from the earliest days. They have been sung particularly in the daily offices of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, and they have figured prominently in the Sunday worship of many Protestant churches, especially the Lutheran and Methodist. Congregational singing is appropriate to the “bodily” character of Christianity in both the physical and the social senses of the word, as it permits the members of the Body of Christ to engage “with one heart and one voice” in the worship of God (Romans 15:5–6).

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                Christians acknowledge not only a duty to announce the gospel, profess the faith, and worship God but also to live their entire lives according to God’s will. Being God’s people means following God’s law, which means walking in the way of truth (Psalm 25:4–5; 86:11) and obeying it (Romans 2:8; Galatians 5:7; 1 Peter 1:22; 3 John 3–4). The dual commandment holds good: to love God and to love neighbour (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref> 22:37–39). To “dwell in love” is to dwell in God, who is both truth and love (1 John).
              </p>
              <p>
                Historically, Christian ethical teaching has had two biblical foci, the Ten Commandments (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="198216" tocid="">Exodus</xref> 20:1–17; Deuteronomy 5:6–21) and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="535714" tocid="">Sermon on the Mount</xref> (Matthew 5–7); the emphasis on one or the other has varied across time and space. The Decalogue, as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="587032" tocid="">Ten Commandments</xref> are sometimes called, remains valid for Christians, although the divine basis grounding the covenant between God and his elect people has been broadened, according to Christian belief, by the redemptive work of Jesus Christ—a move reflected in the shifting of the chief weekly “holy day” from the sabbath (Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 6:12–15) to Sunday, the day of the Lord’s resurrection, when the Christian community gathers to celebrate the new covenant in his blood and the beginning of the new creation. The “second table” of the Law—honouring parents, and rejecting murder, adultery, theft, false witness, and coveting—has been held by Christians to apply universally, the core of a “natural law” extending beyond the community that has received God’s “special revelation.” In this regard, it functions at least to preserve society against the worst ravages of sin until the preaching of the gospel attains its full range and final goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <xref refid="1779327" ty="1" topicid="535714" tocid="">Sermon on the Mount</xref>, Jesus radicalized the Law by, for instance, making anger murderous and lust adulterous (Matthew 5:21–22, 27–28) and calling for his disciples to be “perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). In the <xref refid="1769716" ty="1" topicid="57491" tocid="">Beatitudes</xref> (Matthew 5:1–12), the blessings Jesus offered in the Sermon on the Mount, he declared that the qualities and powers of the impending Kingdom of God were available among his followers in such a way that they would bear a distinctive witness to God before the world (Matthew 5:14–16). Christians have believed that taking the “hard way” (Matthew 7:13–14) is possible by virtue of the divine gift of the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:9–13; cf. Matthew 7:7–12).

                In the epistles of Paul, the indicatives of gospel and faith serve to ground the imperatives of attitude and behaviour. Following his exposition of God’s saving actions in Christ in the first 11 chapters of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508652" tocid="">Letter to the Romans</xref>, Paul asserts, “I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. Do not be conformed to this world [or age] but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good, and acceptable, and perfect” (Romans 12:1–2).

                Christian ethical teaching and practice are intrinsic to the community of the faithful and its life. In the early centuries, certain occupations were considered incompatible with becoming a Christian. According to the <e>Apostolic Tradition</e>, brothel-keepers, prostitutes, sculptors, painters, keepers of idols, actors, charioteers, gladiators, soldiers, magicians, astrologers, and diviners could not become Christians. Moral instruction was provided throughout the catechumenate, and many patristic homilies reveal the ethical teaching and exhortation practiced by the preachers in the liturgical assemblies. Medieval catechesis included the Decalogue, the Beatitudes, and the lists of virtues and vices. The administration of sacramental penance on a regular basis served the formation of individual character and conduct.

                Much material became codified in ecclesiastical regulations known as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="92870" tocid="">canon law</xref>. Whereas the earliest Christians could exercise little or no influence on civil rulers, the “conversion of the Empire” under the 4th-century emperors Constantine and Theodosius permitted bishops their say in the personal and political affairs of emperors and in the wider life of society. In Christendom, legal systems claimed foundations in Christian teaching.

                Modernity brought a decline in the direct institutional role of the churches in society, but the rise of democracy encouraged church leaders to assume an advisory capacity in the shaping of public policy, seeking to guide not only the members of their own ecclesiastical communities but also the whole body politic. On the Roman Catholic part, this has occurred at the global level through the so-called “social encyclicals” of popes from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336286" tocid="">Leo XIII</xref> (<e>Rerum Novarum</e>, 1891; “Of New Things”) through <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304923" tocid="">John XXIII</xref> (<e>Pacem in Terris</e>, 1962; “Peace on Earth”), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446981" tocid="">Paul VI</xref> (<e>Populorum Progressio</e>, 1968; “Progress of the Peoples”), and John <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446940" tocid="">Paul II</xref> (<e>Laborem Exercens</e>, 1981; “Through Work” and <e>Centesimus Annus</e>, 1991; “The 100th Year”). Protestant denominations have typically made pronouncements and initiated programs through their national or international assemblies and agencies. The <xref refid="1769718" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref>, a fellowship of Christian churches founded in 1948, has formulated what were sometimes called “middle axioms” (e.g., the notion of a “responsible society” or “justice, peace and the preservation of creation”), which were intended as common ground on which Christians and secular bodies could meet for thought and action.

                A theological problem resides in the passage from the story of salvation in its broadest terms (the message of the gospel and the content of the faith, concisely and comprehensively formulated) to its enactment in particular questions and instances. For example, it is sometimes held that certain acts are simply contrary to God’s will and purpose for humankind and therefore always morally wrong; yet there is also a view that circumstances can so greatly affect cases that the good may be differently served in different situations. The difficulties that accompany the move from general principle to concrete discipline are illustrated in the report of the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, <e>Life in Christ: Morals, Communion and the Church</e> (1994). It is there claimed that “Anglicans and Roman Catholics derive from the Scriptures and Tradition the same controlling vision of the nature and destiny of humanity and share the same fundamental moral values.” Disagreements on such matters as “abortion and the exercise of homosexual relations” are relegated to the level of “practical and pastoral judgment,” with no account offered of intermediate processes that might allow material differences to develop. Here are not only ecclesiastical but civilizational issues that the next generation may choose to revisit in the light of the moral teaching proposed to church and world in the encyclical letters of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="305139" tocid="">John Paul II</xref>, <e>Veritatis Splendor</e> (1993; “The Splendour of Truth”) and <e>Evangelium Vitae</e> (1995; “The Gospel of Life”).

                Already in apostolic times, distortions of belief threatened the Christian community from within. The apostle Paul needed to correct those who misunderstood the preaching of Christ’s resurrection and the general resurrection to come (1 Corinthians 15). The First Letter of John combats those who denied the reality of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284611" tocid="">Incarnation</xref>—“that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (4:3). Bishop Ignatius of Antioch denounced the same “docetic” tendency—that Jesus only “seemed” (<e>dokein</e>) to be human—when he found heretics abstaining from the Eucharist “because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ which suffered for our sins and which the Father raised” (Letter to the Smyrnaeans 7:1).
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternative understandings of Christian teaching continued to develop throughout early church history. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364265" tocid="">Marcion</xref>, considered the arch-heretic of the 2nd century, rejected the Old Testament as the work of a god inferior to the God of Jesus and accepted from the nascent New Testament only those portions that he took to be uninfected by Judaism. Bishop <xref refid="1769720" ty="1" topicid="293911" tocid="">Irenaeus</xref> of Lyon, in <e>Against the Heresies</e>, ranked Marcion with the “Gnostics,” because at least one facet of Marcion’s error was his depreciation of the material creation. The Gnostics invented complex cosmogonies in order to remove the true God from responsibility for the evils of matter, release from which was the content of human salvation. The goodness of the material creation was affirmed for Irenaeus by the reality of Christ’s incarnation, the sacramental practices of the church (bread and wine made from wheat and grapes), and the Christian hope in the resurrection of the body.
              </p>
              <p>
                More subtle threats than the docetic to the humanity of Christ came from the view that the divine <xref refid="1769724" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref>, the “Word” or the principle of God active in the creation and the continuous structuring of the cosmos, had taken the place of the human mind or will in Jesus. <xref refid="1769727" ty="1" topicid="29863" tocid="">Apollinaris</xref>, whose teaching denied the existence of a rational human soul in Christ, was condemned by the first <xref refid="1769730" ty="1" topicid="134014" tocid="">council of Constantinople</xref> in 381, and monothelitism, which held that Christ had only one will (the divine and not the human), was condemned by the third <xref refid="1769731" ty="1" topicid="134033" tocid="">council of Constantinople</xref> in 680–681. The orthodox teaching was that the Son is a divine person from all eternity who, in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284611" tocid="">Incarnation</xref>, took <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275811" tocid="">human nature</xref> completely upon himself. Only so could humankind have been saved, for—according to the dictum of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245696" tocid="">Gregory of Nazianzen</xref> in the late 4th century—“what had not been assumed would not have been healed” (Epistle 101).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the other direction, faith in Christ’s divinity was affirmed in the face of early views that made of Jesus a man “adopted” by God, whether at his resurrection or at his baptism or even already at his conception—views that respectively pressed into service Romans 1:3–4, Matthew 3:16–17, and Luke 1:31–35. It was to exclude such views even in the subtler form they took with <xref refid="1769732" ty="1" topicid="409867" tocid="">Nestorius</xref>, bishop of Constantinople—whose emphasis on the full humanity of Christ’s human nature seemingly divided him into two persons, one human and the other divine—that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189564" tocid="">council of Ephesus</xref> in 431 insisted on the propriety of the popular title “God-bearer” (Theotokos) for Mary.
              </p>
              <p>Even the New Testament’s affirmations of Christ’s preexistence had not sufficed to persuade some of his fully divine status (John 1:1–3; 1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:15–17). The greatest challenge to the teaching of Christ’s full divinity was that of Arius (early 4th century), who held that the Son, though superior to all other creatures, was in fact God’s first creature. Rejecting that view, the first council of Nicaea in 325 declared that the Son of the Father—“(true) God from (true) God”—was himself “begotten, not made” and the agent of all God’s creation. This echoed the statement in the Gospel of John (1:3) about the divine Logos, that “without him was not anything made that was made.”</p>
              <p>The New Testament writers and the Fathers of the Church had no compunction about identifying false teaching as such. Persistence in it brought expulsion from communion. Many modern scholars have shown more sympathy with so-called heretics, suggesting at least that the controversy inspired by their dissent may have played a useful part in allowing the Church to develop and formulate its doctrine. Christians abiding by historic orthodoxy, however, might argue instead that the authentic instinct of faith has never deviated in such fundamental and central matters as the divine status of Christ and the reality of his humanity.</p>
              <p>
                Heresies have survived or reemerged in the course of history: Arianism continued among the Teutonic tribes until the 7th century and in 18th-century England; “adoptianism” reappeared in Spain and France in the 8th and 9th centuries; antimaterial dualism was revived among the Bulgarian <xref refid="1629595" ty="1" topicid="71461" tocid="">Bogomils</xref> in the 10th century and among the <xref refid="1629596" ty="1" topicid="99473" tocid="">Cathars</xref> of France and Italy in the 12th.

                The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="453623" tocid="">First Letter of Peter</xref> tells its addressees that they must “always be prepared to make a defense (<e>apologia</e>) to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you” (3:15). The defense of the faith has been required of Christians when they faced persecution, but “apologetics” have also been undertaken in the face of intellectual attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 2nd century, several Christian writers—Aristides, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308822" tocid="">Justin Martyr</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="584214" tocid="">Tatian</xref>, Theophilus, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40747" tocid="">Athenagoras</xref>, Tertullian—defended Christianity against the popular and political charges brought against it by non-Christians. It was denounced as an unregistered and “secret” cult and was suspected of immorality (human flesh and blood were consumed at its love feasts) and disloyalty (Christians refused to participate in the civic religion). The Apologists also responded both to the Jews who claimed the Old Testament scriptures as their own and rejected the Christian interpretation of them as fulfilled in Jesus Christ and to the more philosophical criticisms addressed to the doctrine of the Incarnation.
              </p>
              <p>
                These early apologetics came to a climax in the eight books of <e>Against Celsus</e>, a treatise written by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref> around 246–248 to answer the still troublesome work of a Platonist and critic of Christianity dating from about 70 years earlier and claiming to speak “the word of truth” (<e>
                  alêthês <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">logos</xref>
                </e>). Celsus was quite well informed about the Christian scriptures and doctrines, although he associated with them some Gnostic beliefs that were disowned by the churches. He conducted his critique from the moving platform of his own eclectic Middle Platonism along with some Jewish objections to the story of Jesus. Celsus ridiculed the Christian worship of a man of recent appearance who had died a disgraceful death. In order to refute the tolerant and politically convenient polytheism of Celsus, which harmonized the notion of a supreme but distant Deity known under many names with belief in numerous subordinate local deities, Origen drew on arguments that had already been developed in Hellenistic Judaism in favour of monotheism. But Origen needed to defend specific doctrines concerning Christ. In defense of the Incarnation, he argued that the descent of Christ does not require spatial movement when “the Word out of great love for mankind brings down a Saviour to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human race</xref>,” and in support of the Crucifixion he asserted that it was a “death willingly accepted for the human race,” by analogy with “the fact that one righteous man dying voluntarily for the community may avert the activities of evil demons by expiation, since it is they who bring about plagues, or famines, or stormy seas, or anything similar.” Origen insisted that his work was not written for convinced Christians but “either for those entirely without experience of faith in Christ, or for those whom the apostle calls ‘weak in faith’.”

Augustine developed an entire <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267522" tocid="">philosophy of history</xref>, which helped shape for a thousand years the Christian understanding of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref>. His vision embraced two “cities,” the city of God and an earthly city, existing side by side through the course of history: “Two loves have created two cities: love of self, to the contempt of God, the earthly city; love of God, to the contempt of self, the heavenly” (XIV:28). The institutions of the earthly city are not without their divine rationale, for they ensure a relative justice amid the fallen condition of humankind. Yet the happiness the earthly city allows is only temporary, and its society is conflicted. Only the peace and eternity of the divine city match the Supreme Good. Nor is the pilgrim church quite to be equated with the city of God, for the latter already contains the angels and the saints, while the former will have tares mixed in with the wheat until the final judgment. Yet in the centuries of Christendom, Augustine’s treatise was used to ground the doctrine of the superiority of the papacy over the empire and as the foundation for secular political theory and practice. In a world more pluralistically conceived, it has remained possible to draw on Augustine for Christian teaching on political ethics and human destiny more generally.

                When, partly as a result of the European “wars of religion” in the 16th and 17th centuries, doubt took over from faith as a methodological principle in philosophy and the natural sciences, some tried a new apologetic tack. This approach is represented by the “Christian Deist,” Matthew Tindal, who wrote <e>Christianity as Old as the Creation, or the Gospel as a Republication of the Religion of Nature</e> (1730). After a century’s critique of the notion of divine revelation in the name of “Enlightenment,” <xref refid="1629626" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Immanuel Kant</xref> thought that Christianity could and should be fitted into “religion within the limits of reason alone,” as the title of a treatise he published in 1793 suggested.

              <p>
                As the 18th century passed into the 19th, a different style of apologetic was conducted by the Berlin preacher <xref refid="1629629" ty="1" topicid="527577" tocid="">Friedrich Schleiermacher</xref> (1768–1834). Belonging to a family of Reformed ministers and educated at Pietist institutions, Schleiermacher tapped into emergent Romanticism in his <e>On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers</e> (1799). Refusing to identify religion with metaphysics or morals, Schleiermacher located its essence in intuition (<e>Anschauung</e>) and feeling (<e>Gefühl</e>), the “sense and taste for the infinite” (<e>Sinn und Geschmack fürs Unendliche</e>). The founder of Christianity, Schleiermacher noted in his <e>On Religion</e>, was remarkable as the best mediator yet of a clear consciousness of the divine being. Schleiermacher continued this apologetic theme in his comprehensive account of Christian doctrine, <e>The Christian Faith</e> (1821–22; 1831). In his wake, Protestant systematic theology in the 19th and 20th centuries generally sought to operate within the “plausibility structures” of “modernity.” Sometimes it got no further than apologetically oriented considerations of method.

              <headtitle>Restatement: respecting language and knowledge</headtitle>
              <p>
                Restatement of doctrine has been required whenever Christianity crossed a linguistic boundary. The extension from the largely Hebraic and Aramaic world of Jesus and his Apostles into the Hellenistic world had already occurred by the time of the New Testament writings, and Greek became the language of the texts that constitute the permanent basis of Christian doctrine. That was the beginning of what the German theologian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="255617" tocid="">Adolf von Harnack</xref> called the “Hellenization of Christianity,” whose relation to “the historical Jesus”—the putative peasant from Nazareth—has been viewed as problematic by many modern scholars. The New Testament itself was later translated into Latin as the faith spread westward.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some cases, however, a restatement may become necessary even within a single linguistic area. Thus the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413817" tocid="">council of Nicaea</xref> in 325 commandeered the non-scriptural term <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="270595" tocid="">homoousios</xref>
                </e> (“of one substance”) in order to safeguard the essential relation of the Son to the Father that had been denied by Arius. During the 4th century the vocabulary in which Christian belief in the Holy Trinity was stated was gradually stabilized and refined. A similar process took place in the formulation of Christological belief by the council of Chalcedon (451), which defined Christ as “one person, acknowledged in two natures, unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Restatements internal to a linguistic tradition may go hand in glove with shifts in philosophical conceptions of knowledge (epistemology). A prime example is <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>’s participation in the rediscovery of Aristotelian categories (e.g., substance, quantity, quality, and relation), even though he exceeded and transformed them in the service of theological, ethical, and sacramental teachings that in turn shaped doctrinal conceptions and formulations in the Catholic church of the West.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although not always distinguishing between scientific knowledge and the wider philosophical claims sometimes made by particular scientists, many modern theologians have felt a need to restate the gospel and the faith in ways that do not infringe on the knowledge brought by the natural sciences (the very rise of which may have been fostered by the Christian doctrine of creation as both regular and contingent). A prominent attempt to restate the gospel and faith in this way was the program of “demythologization” proposed by the German biblical scholar and Lutheran theologian <xref refid="1629657" ty="1" topicid="84545" tocid="">Rudolf Bultmann</xref> (1884–1976). Bultmann proposed to restate the message of and about Jesus in terms of the existentialist philosophy of <xref refid="1629661" ty="1" topicid="259513" tocid="">Martin Heidegger</xref>: the word of the Cross summoned people to authentic existence by liberating them from the past and opening up to them a new future. In response to Bultmann’s radical program, more traditional theologians argued that the Incarnation and the Resurrection cannot be fitted into any other world view than that of which they are the cornerstone.
              </p>
              <p>In the 1960s, some theologians attempted to state “the secular meaning of the gospel” (the title of a book by P.M. Van Buren) by removing the last traces of transcendence from their accounts, leaving no room for communication or interaction between God and humankind (“revelation,” “grace,” “prayer”) and no expectation of any destiny beyond this world. By the late 20th century, theologians had found hope in the explanatory inadequacy at the scientific level of a sheerly physicalist theory of efficient causality. The door was opened, at least slightly, to the notion of personal purpose, which can point by analogy from the level of human affairs to a view of God and the world that matches more easily the biblical story. This notion can also provide a framework for integrating—as most academic theologians have done—some kind of evolutionary theory into the elucidation of Christian doctrine concerning creation.</p>

              <p>As the gospel has spread into new regions of the world, there has proven to be need and opportunity for fresh conceptions and formulations of the faith. The process of inculturation begins when missionaries first arrive in a region in which Christianity does not exist and the instruction of converts (catechesis) takes place. Gradually, after perhaps experiencing more strongly an initial rupture with their previous culture, those who enter the Christian faith start to give it a more local expression.</p>
              <p>
                Soteriology, the theological study of salvation, has often lent itself to inculturation. An early medieval example is found in the Saxon poem the <e>

              <p>The various dramatic accounts of the Saviour and salvation are stimulated by one or more of the presentations of Christ and his work in the New Testament. In turn, the gospel changes the vernacular language and culture. Liturgy and the arts are the milieux in which these transformative effects are most creatively achieved.

                Jesus “taught with authority” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref> 7:29), and the risen Lord gave his Apostles a share in his authority when he commissioned them to make disciples from all the nations by teaching what he had commanded them (Matthew 28:18–20). The apostolic church trusted that Christ had made provision for Christians to be kept by the Holy Spirit in the truth of the gospel (John 14–16). The apostle Paul charged Timothy to preserve the deposit of the faith among other appointed teachers (1 and 2 Timothy). By the 2nd century, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="66863" tocid="">bishops</xref> were regarded as the special guardians of apostolic teaching; and the practice grew of bishops meeting in council at various geographical levels to determine teaching as needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The very first ecclesiastical council, according to tradition, took place when, as narrated in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="4674" tocid="">Acts</xref> 15, the Apostles and elders met in Jerusalem to determine the conditions under which Gentiles were to be admitted to the church. They concluded that “it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity” (Acts 15:28). The decisions of the council of Jerusalem were termed <e>dogmata</e> (Acts 16:4).
              </p>
              <p>
                <e>Dogma</e> became the traditional term for truths believed to be indispensable to the Christian faith. The question of what precisely counts as dogma is bound up with questions of pronouncement and reception. The most widely recognized source of dogmatic formulations are ecumenical or general councils of the church, but Christian communities vary in the number of councils they recognize as ecumenical. Some ancient communities—now labeled Oriental Orthodox (Syrian, Coptic, Ethiopian, Armenian, Indian)—count only three such councils (Nicaea in 325, Constantinople in 381, and Ephesus in 431). The Byzantine or Eastern Orthodox churches also accept the decisions of the councils of Chalcedon (451), Constantinople II (553), Constantinople III (680–681), and Nicaea II (787). The Roman Catholic Church recognizes 21 such councils, the most recent of which are Trent (1545–63), Vatican I (1869–70), and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Vatican II</xref> (1962–65). Most Protestant churches from the 16th century rely on the first four councils (Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon). Not all councils claiming to be ecumenical have been recognized as such, and not all decisions taken by ecumenical councils are dogmatic in nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conciliar decrees most generally accepted as dogma concern the identity of the Holy Trinity and of Jesus Christ as second person of the Trinity incarnate. The crucial councils of the 4th and 5th centuries clarified and reaffirmed—in the face of what were judged inadequate or deviant understandings—the core content of the confession “Jesus is Lord” and the names “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” in which Christians were baptized. It is significant that the dogmatic affirmations of Nicaea and Constantinople took the form of precisions to extant creeds. Bishop <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">Athanasius</xref> of Alexandria, the principal advocate and defender of Nicaea, insisted that salvation was at stake if the three persons confessed and invoked at baptism were not fully divine, for only God can save (<e>First Letter to Serapion</e>). Bishop <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">Basil of Caesarea</xref>, in his treatise <e>On the Holy Spirit</e>, defended the same view and then deployed theological arguments to show that the three persons of the Trinity properly received equal praise and adoration in the church’s liturgy. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134014" tocid="">council of Constantinople</xref> (381) could expand the creedal formulation to declare belief in the Holy Spirit, the “Lord and Life-giver,…who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified.” Historically, what bishops declare in council, they teach in their churches. They expect to find adhesion from the faithful, since what they teach is “the faith once delivered to the saints,” clarified and consolidated according to circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the <xref refid="1769773" ty="1" topicid="624002" tocid="">First Vatican Council</xref> in 1869–70, the Roman Catholic Church has recognized in the office of the bishop of Rome a special charism, or spiritual gift, that allows him, under certain conditions, infallibly to define the Christian faith and morals in statements that are “irreformable” of themselves. The purpose of this charism is to provide the faithful the certainty of being taught the saving truth. The two dogmas that Catholics consider covered by this papal gift are those of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283499" tocid="">Immaculate Conception</xref> of Mary, promulgated by <xref refid="1629793" ty="1" topicid="462365" tocid="">Pius IX</xref> in 1854, and Mary’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="39503" tocid="">assumption</xref>, body and soul, into heaven, promulgated by <xref refid="1629794" ty="1" topicid="462400" tocid="">Pius XII</xref> in 1950.

                Protestant churches have not claimed to hold general councils or to promulgate dogmas. Perhaps the closest attempt at the latter was the Lutheran <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131222" tocid="">Book of Concord</xref>, produced in Germany in 1580. Protestant churches have usually viewed their synods or assemblies as competent to “interpret” doctrine under the supreme norm of Scripture and with the guidelines provided by the earlier creeds and confessions that come from the general tradition of the “church universal” or their particular tradition. Since the 20th century, many Protestant synods have included not only pastors but also laypeople in their membership.

              <p>Short of dogma, considerable authority accrues to broad patterns of stating and practicing the Christian faith that have maintained themselves over time and space.

              <p>
                The Eastern Orthodox churches detect a “common mind of the fathers” (<e>consensus patrum</e>), which allows for some variety of contribution and emphasis among the Fathers. The most respected synthesis is that of <xref refid="1769774" ty="1" topicid="305049" tocid="">John of Damascus</xref> (<e>c.</e> 675–749), whose defense of icon veneration also anticipated the decision of the seventh ecumenical council (Nicaea II, 787). In his “Exposition of the Orthodox Faith,” the Damascene first treats God, who is by nature incomprehensible. His existence and unity, however, can be inferred from the contingency and order of the created universe. He has, moreover, revealed himself adequately for our good in those things to which the Law, the Prophets, the Apostles, and the Evangelists bear testimony; humankind can thereby know that God is Trinity, though not the precise manner of the “mutual indwelling” (<e>perichôrêsis</e>) of the three hypostases. After his discussion of God, John treats creation, noting that the angels were created first and that the devil “was the first to depart from good and become evil.” Concerning the wider material creation, he offers a theological perspective on astronomy, meteorology, geography, and zoology. Although human beings, John argues, were made “in God’s image” (i.e., with mind and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218436" tocid="">free will</xref>) and “after God’s likeness” (i.e., to go forward in the path of goodness), they fell by pride and became slaves of passions and appetites; yet God continued to care for them. In the economy of salvation, John goes on, God has sought to win humankind back; God became human and acted from within in the person of the incarnate Son. Finally, he explains that since Christ was without sin, death could not hold him. Through faith and baptism humans are in him restored to communion with God, set upon the way of virtue, and renewed in a life that, nourished by the Eucharist, will be crowned by participation in the divine glory. John’s work has remained influential in the Eastern church and was known to <xref refid="1629824" ty="1" topicid="453784" tocid="">Peter Lombard</xref> (1100–60) and Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) in the medieval West.

              <p>
                The <e>Summa theologiae</e> begins with the questions regarding human knowledge of God—what may be known by reason and what depends on faith, and the status of language used to refer to God. The first part of the <e>Summa</e> goes on to deal substantively with the Trinity, creation, and human nature. The second and longest part is modeled on Aristotle’s <e>Nicomachean Ethics</e> and finds that much in Aristotle is congenial to Christian moral thinking. The third part—which was left unfinished—is concerned with the dogmatic topics of the Incarnation and the sacraments. Each major question is treated in several articles, which themselves begin with a subquestion, to which a plausible first answer is indicated (<e>Videtur quod</e>, “it seems that”). A different position is briefly stated (<e>Sed contra</e>, “But on the other hand”), usually in the name of a scriptural or patristic authority. Finally, Aquinas develops his own opinion (<e>Respondeo dicendum</e>, “I respond that”), which is basically the second position (though it may integrate valid elements from the first answer) together with replies to remaining objections.
              </p>
              <p>In Protestantism, the nearest approach to a broad consensus may be found in the respective traditions that stay within the vectors set by their chief reformers and their confessions and catechisms in the 16th century—so that at least a family resemblance remains among Lutherans or the Reformed. The individualism, however, that has characterized modernity—and to which Protestantism itself has contributed—makes it harder to speak of an authoritative “common mind” in the Protestant communities at large. The difficulty is compounded insofar as Protestant theologians have tended to be more accommodating than Orthodox or Catholics to fast-moving shifts in the general culture. Nevertheless, Luther and, to a lesser degree, Calvin and Wesley are recurrently appealed to in various ways as doctrinal mentors in their respective traditions.</p>

              <p>Even though some Christians hold governing positions which give them official responsibilities for doctrine and others work in theology as a professional vocation, all the faithful engage, with varying degrees of competence, in theological and doctrinal work. When carried out within the discipline of the historic and contemporary community of faith, this is not a private or individualistic exercise; rather, believers make a responsible personal appropriation of the gospel and apply it to their lives and circumstances. This active learning places them not simply among the taught but within the teaching church, serving their fellow members, edifying the entire body, and bearing witness to people outside.</p>
              <p>In the early church, the outstanding theologians were almost always pastoral bishops. In the Middle Ages, however, an increasing professionalization of the theological schools took place, even as the rising universities remained under episcopal oversight. Modernity brought a gradual secularization to the academy, so that scholars in theology became assimilated to colleagues in other faculties and adopted their procedures. Theologians often found themselves working at a distance both from ecclesiastical authorities and from the spiritual life of their local congregations (even though many of them maintained a personal piety). Theology itself was divided into subdisciplines; the most serious divisions were probably that between scripture and systematics, and that between scripture and systematics, on the one hand, and “practical theology” on the other. On all sides and from all directions, it appeared difficult to bring a faithful intellectual contribution to bear in a coordinated way on performing the perennial tasks of Christian doctrine.</p>

                In the various communities that claim to be part of historic Christianity, the concise and comprehensive statement of Christian doctrine that is most widely recognized is the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref>. In 1982 the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches recognized that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30242" tocid="">Apostles’ Creed</xref> was the baptismal symbol (creed) used throughout the West but took the Nicene Creed as the “theological and methodological tool” to “identify the fundamentals of the apostolic faith which should be explicated.” The commission recognized that the Nicene Creed has been universally accepted as containing the essential teachings of the faith and that the faith stated by the creed is shared by some “non-creedal churches” that are wary of “fixed” or “imposed” forms. The creed “thus serves to indicate whether the faith as set forth in modern situations is the same faith as the one the Church confessed through the centuries.” It might also have been said, in reverse, that the creed summarizes the faith from which Christians start in preaching the gospel today.
              </p>
              <p>
                <e>Confessing the One Faith</e> (1991), the document that the Faith and Order Commission placed before the member churches, works through each section and clause of the creed. The creed’s phraseology is elucidated in terms of “its biblical witness” and, where necessary, in terms of the 4th-century controversies that prompted the introduction of certain technical formulations. The creed’s affirmations are then explicated in the face of contemporary “challenges,” which include the problem that the original language and philosophy in which the creeds were formulated are no longer those of the present day, the issue of the affirmation and appreciation of old and new religions in various cultures, and the fact that modern secular society questions many of the affirmations of Christianity.

                In response to atheism and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="532006" tocid="">secularism</xref>, the Faith and Order document, which is much indebted in this section to Wolfhart Pannenberg, proclaims that “the world of finite things and the secular social system both lack ultimate meaning and purpose without a transcendent reality as their basis.” The commission further asserts that the proper response to some Asian and African religious beliefs, which find the Christian doctrine of God too abstract and divorced from everyday life, is not to be found in <xref refid="1629981" ty="1" topicid="441533" tocid="">pantheism</xref> but rather in “the concreteness of the One God…in the work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit” as this occurs in “the history of salvation,” which is the basis for faith in the eternal Trinity. Moreover, the doctrine of the Trinity offers a consistent monotheism because it incorporates the principle of plurality and diversity within the unity of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding “the Father almighty,” <e>Confessing the One Faith</e> argues that it is necessary to speak of the Father together with the Son in order to prevent the emergence of either a trivial or a sentimental view of divine fatherhood or of a view of the Father’s power as arbitrary. The term Father is to be retained because it is the name by which Jesus as the incarnate Son addressed him and because it defines the relationships within the Trinity as well as those between God and humankind. As an image, the divine fatherhood designates also the providential care and compassion of God, which may also contain motherly aspects. In relation to humankind, “God embraces, fulfils and transcends all that we know concerning human persons, both male and female, and human characteristics, whether masculine or feminine.”

              <headtitle>Development: the maturation of understanding</headtitle>
              <p>It took some 350 years to get from the apostolic age to the doctrinal formulations of the Nicene Creed. The question thus arises whether a process of development was taking place. If so, what kinds of development were they? What was their significance, both for the substantive issues affected and for the way in which the formative period is viewed by subsequent generations of Christians? And is a principle of development allowed or established that may then be applied to other issues and at other times?</p>
              <p>
                As the 2nd century turned into the 3rd, both Irenaeus, in <e>Against the Heresies</e>, and Tertullian, in <e>On the Prescription of Heretics</e>, in reference to the variability, innovations, and secretiveness of the teaching of the so-called Gnostics, pointed to the constant and public teaching given throughout the church, notably in the apostolic sees, and most particularly in Rome, where the church was founded by Peter and Paul. In setting out the “rule of faith,” Irenaeus combines a recital of the mighty acts of God in creation and history with the threefold structure of the divine Name in which baptism is administered (Matthew 28:19, and the baptismal profession found in the<e> Apostolic Tradition</e>).
              </p>
              <p>The rule of faith outlined by Irenaeus and Tertullian remains the formal pattern of the Nicene Creed. However, the evolution of doctrine between their time and the 4th-century councils of Nicaea and Constantinople is suggested by the insertions that the two councils made in the older texts concerning the essential being of the Son (“God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father”) and of the Holy Spirit (“the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified”). These steps were taken in order to safeguard the established soteriological understandings and liturgical practices against rather blatant distortions of the apostolic message, and as a result of the exploration of previously unposed or unsettled questions and the intellectual and spiritual energy of successive generations in applying the inherited faith within their cultural circumstances.</p>
              <p>
                This was the kind of process that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413004" tocid="">John Henry Newman</xref> called “the development of an idea.” As noted in his <e>Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine</e>, a “great idea” takes a “longer time and deeper thought for [its] full elucidation,” but this process of “germination and maturation” will be a “development” only if “the assemblage of aspects, which constitute its ultimate shape, really belongs to the idea from which they start.” “Young birds do not grow into fishes,” said Newman in that work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Newman also thought that such a development would continue, and he left the Anglican church for the Roman Catholic Church in 1845 because he judged that the latter best embodied such a development. It would in fact be developmental grounds that provided a theological justification for the doctrines of Mary’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283499" tocid="">Immaculate Conception</xref> (defined in 1854) and heavenly assumption (defined in 1950). The declaration of these teachings was held to make explicit things that were implicit in the apostolic witness but had required centuries of devotional practice and speculative reasoning to be brought out. Newman also considered that an infallible teaching office lay in the origins and logic of a developmental Christianity—indeed with a Roman focus, although he questioned the “opportunity” of its dogmatization in 1869–70, which in substance attributed that function to the pope without a general council.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Eastern churches also accept a development of doctrine beyond Nicaea I and Constantinople I, embracing (in the case of the Byzantine churches) not only the council of Ephesus in 431 (as the Oriental Orthodox do) but also the councils of Chalcedon, Constantinople II and III, and Nicaea II. The later councils are viewed as having clarified and explicated, but not altered, the teachings of the earlier councils. Thus Nicaea II, for instance, in deciding for the veneration of icons, was being true to the dogmas of the one person and two natures of Christ. The Eastern churches also hold to the infallibility of the church, thanks to its divine foundation and guidance by the Son and the Spirit and the pastoral oversight of its bishops in faithful succession. They do not, however, judge that the conditions have been met for the meeting of an ecumenical council after Nicaea II and the reception of its teaching by the whole body of the faithful. This has not stopped certain “doctrinal developments” from being widely regarded as legitimate and commendable. An example is the reception of the teaching of <xref refid="1630009" ty="1" topicid="439149" tocid="">Gregory Palamas</xref> (14th century), who identified the “uncreated light” manifested at the Transfiguration of Christ on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579847" tocid="">Mount Tabor</xref> with the “divine energies” by which Christian believers are savingly “deified” (an inner transformation mystically uniting God and the individual).
              </p>
              <p>The Protestant reformers in the 16th century attempted to undo what they regarded as false developments (“corruptions,” in Newman’s terminology) in the Western church. They wished to go back—not so much historically as theologically—to Scripture, especially in matters of applied soteriology (though in matters of Christology and the Trinity they remained under the guidance of the councils of the 4th and 5th centuries). Modern progressive Protestants sometimes try to reclaim the notion of development to justify certain recent shifts that others would regard as deviations or degeneration.</p>

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="527428" tocid="">Schism</xref>: division over substantial matters
              </headtitle>
              <p>Believing that divine truth and human salvation are at stake, Christians take the formulation of doctrine with the utmost seriousness. Ecclesiology, in which the church itself is the topic of study, is integral to the process, for it addresses the nature, identity, and location of “the church” as the body that receives the revelation, transmits the message, and incorporates believers into its community. When differences arise among Christians on substantial matters, they may fall into division for the sake, as each side sees it, of truth and salvation. As long as parties to the conflict remain within hailing distance of each other, they continue the controversy and hope nevertheless to achieve reconciliation in the truth, for it belongs to salvation that Christ’s disciples should live together in unity.</p>
              <p>
                Schisms have occurred for a variety of reasons. First, certain decisions made by general councils have not been accepted by all sides in dispute at the time. Institutionally, the longest-lasting divisions of this kind have been between those churches which rejected the Christological decisions of Ephesus in 431 (labeled Nestorians by their opponents but self-designated the Apostolic Catholic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409819" tocid="">Assyrian Church</xref> of the East) or of Chalcedon in 451 (labeled Monophysites but more amicably the Oriental Orthodox churches, comprising Copts, Ethiopians, Syrians, Indians, and Armenians) and those churches that abide by Ephesus and Chalcedon, namely the (Eastern, Byzantine) Orthodox and the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christians have also divided as a result of the breakdown of apparent consensus. This happened between the Byzantine East and the Roman West in the early Middle Ages. While linguistic, political, and cultural factors certainly played a part, irreducibly doctrinal matters were also involved. The West was uneasy with the Eastern understanding of the decisions of Chalcedon concerning the natures of Christ. The Carolingian council of Frankfurt (794) feared that the “Eastern” council of Nicaea II had sanctioned the veneration of images beyond due limits. The gravest matter, however, concerned the insertion of the word <e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="206865" tocid="">Filioque</xref>
                </e> into the Nicene-Constantinoplitan creed, whereby the Western churches had come to confess that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father “and from the Son.” The word was introduced—probably as an anti-Arian move—by the regional council of Toledo in 589 and later spread throughout the Frankish empire; Rome adopted it only in 1014. The Orthodox East objected formally to the unilateral alteration of the creed and materially to a teaching that seemed to them to fuse the Father and the Son into a single principle. In 1054, the bishops of Rome and Constantinople engaged in a mutual excommunication because of theological differences and the refusal of Constantinople to accept Roman claims of primacy. The excommunications, which effectively divided the East and the West, were “erased from memory and the midst of the Church” by Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446981" tocid="">Paul VI</xref> and Patriarch <xref refid="1630621" ty="1" topicid="40749" tocid="">Athenagoras I</xref> of Constantinople in 1965, but their two churches are not yet in ecclesiastical communion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, what Jeffrey Burton Russell, the noted historian of the medieval church, calls “dissent” from “order” in the medieval West generally occurred less on the intellectual plane than as an attempt at moral and institutional reform. Nevertheless, what were labeled with the rather elastic term “heresies” sometimes had doctrinal import. Reforming movements often arose in monastic or lay circles, perhaps against a background of apocalyptic impatience with the present world, and they could be domesticated by “the authorities,” so that even popes could espouse reform. Few long-lasting schisms took place along these lines (though the <xref refid="1630630" ty="1" topicid="634415" tocid="">Waldenses</xref> and the <xref refid="1630631" ty="1" topicid="277581" tocid="">Hussites</xref> have survived as separate bodies). On the doctrinal level, the greatest potential for disruption resided in the reformers’ claims of new inspiration by the Holy Spirit, which was sometimes mediated through new interpretations of Scripture. The role of the Holy Spirit was elevated by <xref refid="1769975" ty="1" topicid="304176" tocid="">Joachim of Fiore</xref> (<e>c.</e> 1130/35–1201/02) to a re-periodization of the history of salvation, in which the impending “age of the Spirit” would follow on those of the Father and the Son.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether positively or negatively, some have interpreted the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Protestant Reformation</xref> of the 16th century as the last of the medieval reform movements. The Protestant reformers were concerned with matters of doctrine and viewed the condition and practices of contemporary Christendom as the disfiguring outcrop of distorted understandings of God, humankind, and salvation. Liturgical features of the mass (connected above all with its sacrificial character), the intercession and relics of the saints, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483923" tocid="">purgatory</xref> and indulgences—all appeared to require the reaffirmation of Christ alone (against the mediation of church or saints), grace alone (against merit), faith alone (against works, though not as the fruit of faith), and Scripture alone (as <e>norma normans</e>; “the norm that norms,” or “ultimate standard”) over any subordinate standards in tradition. The response of the “papal church” was neither quick enough nor far-reaching enough for the reformers, who therefore each carried out their confessional, liturgical, catechetical, and institutional programs in their respective territorial areas. Although various families of Protestant churches formed themselves (Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican), they usually were not in full ecclesiastical communion with each other; the separating factors were chiefly differences over the presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper and over the pastoral and governmental structures of the church.
              </p>
              <p>The emergence of new issues is yet another circumstance that may cause division among Christians. Heavy debate has attended the relation between the Christian doctrine of creation and the cosmological and evolutionary theories of the natural sciences. Although no major ecclesiastical schisms have taken place directly over these questions, shifts in worldview fostered by the rise of the sciences may underlie some of the doctrinal tensions in modern Christianity.</p>
              <p>
                At the beginning of the 21st century, it seemed that three issues in particular might cause division. First, the ordination of women to the presbyterate and then to the episcopate in the last quarter of the 20th century resulted in an “impairment of communion” within and among the provinces of Anglicanism, and it further complicated the relationships between Protestant churches on the one hand and Catholic and Orthodox on the other. Second, the question of the acceptability or not of homosexual practices is agitating many Western churches and disturbing relationships within their global ecclesiastical families. Third, a study text of the World Council of Churches’ Faith and Order Commission, <e>The Nature and Purpose of the Church: A Stage on the Way to a Common Statement</e> (1998), signals that “some churches” are asking whether it is necessarily “church-dividing” to “confess Christ only as one mediator among others.” Certainly, the relation between Christ—scripturally and traditionally preached by Christians as the unique and universal Saviour—and the religions into which most of humankind is grouped is an important issue.

              <headtitle>Controversy: fighting over the faith</headtitle>
              <p>Controversies have always preceded schisms but have not necessarily resulted in them. After a division, the contesting parties seek to consolidate their respective positions, both among their supporters and against their opponents, so that doctrine takes on an apologetic character even between Christians and acquires—on the assumption that attack is the best form of defense—a polemical edge. As a result, the teaching of each community sometimes suffers through the exaggeration of certain features and the neglect of others.</p>
              <p>One controversy that led to schism is the debate between East and West concerning the Spirit’s procession. The Eastern churches have long suspected that the West’s error resides in giving an “Augustinian” priority to an undifferentiated divine essence that in fact renders the distinct persons nonessential to the Godhead. The West, meanwhile, has suspected that the East, by holding to the Father (alone) as “the fount of deity,” may never have overcome the “Arian” subordination of the other two persons of the Godhead.</p>
              <p>The other main issue between East and West has concerned the status of the see of Rome. Although the East has recognized that Rome enjoyed a certain “primacy of honour” among the other patriarchal sees of the first millennium (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem), it considers hypertrophic the development by which Rome dogmatized its own claim to universal jurisdiction and an infallible teaching authority.</p>
              <p>
                In the 16th century, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Luther</xref>’s pugnacity on behalf of his rediscovered gospel expressed itself in combative writings aimed at various targets. The most decisive of those aimed at Rome was the treatise <e>On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church</e> (1520), which attacked the current sacramental system and left Christ himself as the sole sacrament in the scriptural sense (cf. 1 Timothy 3:16) and baptism and the Lord’s Supper as his “sacramental signs.” Luther also attacked the “enthusiasts” among the would-be reformers; at the colloquy of Marburg (1529), rejecting the teachings of <xref refid="1769990" ty="1" topicid="658598" tocid="">Huldrych Zwingli</xref>, he proclaimed the existence of the real presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper with a literal <e>est</e> (“This <e>is</e> my body”). Luther approved the relatively conciliatory Confession of Augsburg (1530), but the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="527718" tocid="">Schmalkaldic Articles</xref> of 1537 turned fiercely against Rome, which responded at the Council of Trent (1545–63), where it asserted the validity of traditional Catholic teachings in areas of conflict—salvation, sacraments, ecclesiology—and anathematized any who should hold positions that it perceived to exist in Protestantism.
              </p>
              <p>
                The confessional documents of the Reformation churches typically combined a reaffirmation of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="605497" tocid="">Trinitarian</xref> and Christological doctrines of the ancient councils and creeds with a new statement of scriptural soteriology against the current understanding and practice of the Roman Church.

                Nevertheless, the European “wars of religion” of the 16th and 17th centuries resulted, if only by reaction and at a geographically variable pace, in the growth of civil tolerance.

                Although the Orthodox patriarchate of Constantinople took a significant first step by its proposal of a “league of churches” in 1920, the ecumenical movement was largely Protestant in its origins. The Roman see suspected “religious indifferentism” (as indicated in Pius XI’s encyclical of 1928, <e>Mortalium Animos</e> [“On Religious Unity”]) and was hesitant to join the movement. But pioneering efforts in “spiritual ecumenism,” followed by mid-century convergences at the scholarly level, prepared for the official entrance of the Roman Catholic Church on the ecumenical scene with the holding of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Second Vatican Council</xref> (Vatican II; 1962–65).

                The Faith and Order Commission study that attracted the greatest degree of participation from the widest range of churches was <e>Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry</e> (1982), whose initial reception was remarkably positive. On the touchstone question of the Eucharist, the study affirmed the “real, living, and active presence” of Christ but hardly settled the centuries-old controversies over the manner of that presence in relation to the bread and wine.

                On All Saints’ Eve, 1999, the <e>Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</e> was signed in Augsburg, Germany, by representatives of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352070" tocid="">Lutheran World Federation</xref>. By declaring that the mutual condemnations of the 16th century did not apply to the teaching on justification as now stated together (with tolerable nuances of detail on either side), Lutherans and Catholics proclaimed what may have been the key issue of the Reformation settled, even if other doctrinal and institutional matters needed to be resolved before full reconciliation could take place.

                In multilateral terms, Pope John Paul II, in the encyclical <e>Ut Unum Sint</e>, noted the considerable ecumenical progress made in the second half of the 20th century on doctrinal questions and then listed five topics that required further study: (1) “the relationship between Sacred Scripture, as the highest authority in matters of faith, and Sacred Tradition, as indispensable to the interpretation of the Word of God,” (2) “the Eucharist, as the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, an offering of praise to the Father, the sacrificial memorial and Real Presence of Christ, and the sanctifying outpouring of the Holy Spirit,” (3) “ordination, as a sacrament, to the threefold ministry of the episcopate, presbyterate and diaconate,” (4) “the Magisterium of the Church, entrusted to the Pope and the Bishops in communion with him, understood as a responsibility and an authority exercised in the name of Christ for teaching and safeguarding the faith,” and (5) “the Virgin Mary, as Mother of God and Icon of the Church, the spiritual Mother who intercedes for Christ’s disciples and for all humanity.” John Paul II invited “the leaders of other churches and their theologians” to engage with him “in a patient and fraternal dialogue” on the claims of the primatial Roman see to a universal ministry of unity; he felt his own responsibility “in acknowledging the ecumenical aspirations of the majority of the Christian Communities and in heeding the request made of me to find a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is nonetheless open to a new situation.”

              </thumbasm>On the basis of their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497327" tocid="">religious experiences</xref>, the mystics of Christianity of all eras have concurred in the belief that one can make no assertions about God, because God is beyond all concepts and images. Inasmuch as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> are gifted with reason, however, the religious experience of transcendence demands historical clarification. Thus, in Christian theology two tendencies stand in constant tension with each other. On the one hand, there is the tendency to systematize the idea of God as far as possible. On the other, there is the tendency to eliminate the accumulated collection of current conceptions of God and to return to the understanding of his utter transcendence. Theologians, by and large, have had to acknowledge the limits of human reason and language to address the “character” of God, who is beyond normal human experience but who impinges on it. But because of the divine–human contact, it became necessary and possible for them to make some assertions about the experience, the disclosure, and the character of God.

              All great epochs of the history of Christianity are defined by new forms of the experience of God and of Christ. <xref refid="1631027" ty="1" topicid="434884" tocid="">Rudolf Otto</xref>, a 20th-century German theologian, attempted to describe to some extent the basic ways of experiencing the transcendence of the “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515425" tocid="">holy</xref>.” He called these the experience of the “numinous” (the spiritual dimension), the utterly ineffable, the holy, and the overwhelming. The “holy” is manifested in a double form: as the <e>mysterium tremendum</e> (“mystery that repels”), in which the dreadful, fearful, and overwhelming aspect of the numinous appears, and as the <e>mysterium fascinosum</e> (“mystery that attracts”), by which humans are irresistibly drawn to the glory, beauty, adorable quality, and the blessing, redeeming, and salvation-bringing power of transcendence. All of these features are present in the Christian concepts of God as explicated in the ever new experiences of the charismatic leaders.

              <headtitle>Characteristic features of the Christian concept of God</headtitle>
              <p>
                Within the Christian perception and experience of God, characteristic features stand out: (1) the personality of God, (2) God as the Creator, (3) God as the Lord of history, and (4) God as Judge. (1) God, as person, is the “I am who I am” designated in Exodus 3:14. The personal consciousness of human beings awakens in the encounter with God understood as a person: “The Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend” (Exodus 33:11). (2) God is also viewed as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142144" tocid="">Creator</xref> of heaven and Earth. The believer thus maintains, on the one hand, acknowledgement of divine omnipotence as the creative power of God, which also operates in the preservation of the world, and, on the other hand, trusts in the world, which—despite all its contradictions—is understood as one world created by God according to definite laws and principles and according to an inner plan. The decisive aspect of creation, however, is that God fashioned <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">humans</xref> according to the divine image and made the creation subject to them. This special position of humans in the creation, which makes them coworkers of God in the preservation and consummation of the creation, brings a decisively new characteristic into the understanding of God. (3) This new characteristic is God as the Lord of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267522" tocid="">history</xref>, which is the main feature of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> understanding of God: God selects a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="114629" tocid="">special people</xref> and contracts a special covenant with them. Through the Law the divine agent binds this “people of God” in a special way. God sets before them a definite goal of salvation—the establishment of a divine dominion—and through the prophets admonishes the people by proclamations of salvation and calamity whenever they are unfaithful to the covenant and promise. (4) This God of history also is the God of judgment. The Israelite belief that the disclosure of God comes through the history of divinely-led people leads, with an inner logic, to the proclamation of God as the Lord of world history and as the Judge of the world.

              <headtitle>The specific concept of God as Father</headtitle>
              <p>
                What is decisively new in the Christian, New Testament faith in God lies in the fact that this faith is so closely bound up with the person, teaching, and work of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> that it is difficult to draw boundaries between theology (doctrines of God) and Christology (doctrines of Christ). The special relationship of Jesus to God is expressed through his designation of God as Father. In prayers Jesus used the Aramaic word <e>abba</e> (“father”) for God, which is otherwise unusual in religious discourse in Judaism; it was usually employed by children for their earthly father. This father–son relationship became a prototype for the relationship of Christians to God. Appeal to the sonship of God played a crucial role in the development of Jesus’ messianic self-understanding. According to the account of Jesus’ baptism, Jesus understood his sonship when a voice from heaven said: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” In The Gospel According to John, this sonship constitutes the basis for the self-consciousness of Jesus: “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30).

              <p>
                Faith in the Son also brought about a oneness with the Father. The Son became the mediator of the glory of the Father to those who believe in him. In Jesus’ high priestly prayer (in John, chapter 17) he says: “The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly one.” In the <xref refid="1631028" ty="1" topicid="348087" tocid="">Lord’s Prayer</xref> Jesus taught his disciples to address God as “our Father.”
              </p>
              <p>The Father-God of Jesus after Jesus’ death and Resurrection becomes—for his disciples—the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (e.g., 2 Corinthians 1:3), who revealed his love through the sacrifice of his Son who was sent into the world. Faithful Christians can thus become the children of God, as noted in Revelation 21:7: “I will be his God and he shall be my son.” For Christians, therefore, faith in God is not a doctrine to be detached from the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>
                Medieval theologians often spoke of a “Beatific Vision,” a blessed vision of God. In the history of Christian mysticism, this visionary experience of the transpersonal “Godhead” behind the personal “God” (as in the works of the medieval mystic <xref refid="1631029" ty="1" topicid="178072" tocid="">Meister Eckhart</xref>)—also called an experience of the “trans-deity,” the “divine ground,” “groundlessness,” the “abyss,” and the divine “nothingness”—constantly breaks through and is renewed. Occasionally, this experience of transpersonal divine transcendence has directed itself against the development of a piety that has banalized the personal idea of God so much so that the glory and holiness of God has been trivialized. The attempt of the 20th-century theologian <xref refid="1631030" ty="1" topicid="595850" tocid="">Paul Tillich</xref> to reduce the Christian idea of God to the impersonal concept of “the Ground of Being,” or “Being Itself,” pointed toward an understanding of the pre-personal depths of the transcendence of Godhood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, in the Christian understanding of Christ as being one with the Father, there is a possibility that faith in God will be absorbed in a “monochristism”—i.e., that the figure of the Son in the life of faith will overshadow the figure of the Father and thus cause it to disappear and that the figure of the Creator and Sustainer of the world will recede behind the figure of the Redeemer. Thus, the primacy of Christology and of the doctrine of justification in Reformation theology led to a depreciation of the creation doctrine and a Christian cosmology. This depreciation accelerated the estrangement between theology and the sciences during the period of the Enlightenment. This was subsequently distorted into a form of materialism. On the other hand, some 20th-century dialectical theologians, among them <xref refid="1770053" ty="1" topicid="54293" tocid="">Karl Barth</xref>, in opposing materialism and humanism sometimes evoked a monochristic character that strongly accented the centrality of Christ at the expense of some cultural ties.

              <headtitle>The revelatory character of God</headtitle>
              <p>
                The God of the Bible is the God who presses toward <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="500286" tocid="">revelation</xref>. The creation of the world is viewed as an expression of God’s will toward self-revelation, for even the pagans “knew God.” In Paul’s so-called Areopagus speech in Athens, he said of God: “Yet he is not far from each one of us, for ‘in him we live and move and have our being,’” in allusion to the words of the pagan writer <xref refid="1631228" ty="1" topicid="32161" tocid="">Aratus</xref>: “For we are indeed his offspring” (Acts 17:27–28). This was the beginning of a knowledge of God that has manifested itself under the catchphrase of the “natural revelation” of God or God’s revelation in the “book of nature.” It has survived as one strand of theory throughout much of Christian history.
              </p>
              <p>The self-revelation of God presupposes, however, a basic biblical understanding of the existing relationship between God and human beings. It cannot be separated from the view that God created humans according to the divine image and that in Jesus Christ, who “reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature” (Hebrews 1:3), the heavenly man has appeared among humans as the “last Adam.” The inner connection between the “natural” and the biblical revelation takes place through the view of Christ as the divine Logos become human.</p>

                Hellenistic thinkers had already been attracted by the emphasis in later Judaism on monotheism and transcendence. This tendency was sketched out earlier in Plato and later Stoicism, but it came to its mature development in Neoplatonism in the 3rd century <e ty="s">ad</e>. In the 1st century <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456612" tocid="">Philo of Alexandria</xref> interpreted the Hebrew Bible’s concept of God in terms of the Logos idea of Hellenistic philosophy, but this Hellenization led to a tension that was to dominate the entire further history of Christian piety, as well as the Western history of ideas. The Greeks traced the idea of God to a “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="208087" tocid="">first cause</xref>” that stood behind all other causes and effects. Theologians under their influence used this understanding to contribute to a doctrine of God as “first cause” in Christian theology.

              <p>
                The biblical understanding of God, however, was based on the idea of the freedom of the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge and included the concept that God could suspend the natural order or break the causal chain through miracles. This led theologians to two specific problems: (1) the attempt to prove the existence of God, and (2) the attempt to justify God in view of both the apparent shortcomings of the creation and the existence of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="197324" tocid="">evil</xref> in history (i.e., the problem of <xref refid="1631244" ty="1" topicid="590596" tocid="">theodicy</xref>). Both attempts have occupied the intellectual efforts of Western theologians and have inspired the highest of intellectual achievements. These attempts, however, often presumed that human reason could define the transcendent. Although theologians creatively addressed the issue, it was often simple Christian piety that served to guard the notion of transcendence, while concentrating on the historical revelation of God in the more accessible instrument of God’s self-disclosure in Jesus Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Efforts to explain the ways of God to humans, particularly in respect to the problem of the existence of evil, are called theodicy. This form of justification of God has addressed profound human impulses and has relied upon strenuous exercises of human reason, but it has also led to no finally satisfying conclusions. The problem, which was already posed by Augustine and treated in detail by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>, became of pressing importance in the European <xref refid="1631246" ty="1" topicid="592619" tocid="">Thirty Years’ War</xref> (1618–48) and its aftermath. At that time <xref refid="1631247" ty="1" topicid="335266" tocid="">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</xref>, who did more than anyone to develop the concept of theodicy, endeavoured to defend the Christian notion of God against the obvious atheistic consequences that were evoked by the critical thinkers of his time. The result of such theological efforts, however, was either to declare God himself as the originator of evil, to excuse evil as a consequence of divine “permission,” or instead—as with Hegel—to understand world history as the justification of God (“the true theodicy, the justification of God in history”). These answers did not always satisfy the Christian experience of faith. Many writers influenced by the Christian tradition have reacted against such justifications, most notably the Russian novelist <xref refid="1631245" ty="1" topicid="169765" tocid="">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</xref> in his treatment of the suffering of children in <e>The Brothers Karamazov</e> (1879–80).

                The German philosopher <xref refid="1631249" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Immanuel Kant</xref> set the terms for much modern reflection on God’s existence when he challenged the grounds of most previous efforts to prove it. Kant contended that it was finally impossible for the human intellect to achieve insights into the realm of the transcendent. Even as he was arguing this, modern science was shifting from grounds that presumed the nature of God and God’s universe to autonomous views of nature that were grounded only in experiment, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="547424" tocid="">skepticism</xref>, and research. During the 19th century, philosophers in Kantian and scientific traditions despaired of the attempt to prove the existence of God.

              <p>
                During the same period some Western intellectuals turned against the very idea of God. One strand of Hegelian thinkers, typified by the German philosopher <xref refid="1631250" ty="1" topicid="205641" tocid="">Ludwig Feuerbach</xref>, attempted to unmask the idea of religion as illusion. To Feuerbach, faith was an <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="281943" tocid="">ideology</xref> designed to help humans delude themselves. The idea of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="161209" tocid="">dialectical materialism</xref>, in which the concept of “spirit” was dropped by thinkers such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367265" tocid="">Karl Marx</xref>, developed in this tradition. It also characterized religion as “bad faith” or “the opiate of the people,” designed to seduce them from efforts to build a good society through the hope of rewards in a life to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, at first chiefly in Britain, scientific thinkers in the tradition of <xref refid="1631251" ty="1" topicid="151902" tocid="">Charles Darwin</xref> hypothesized that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="197367" tocid="">evolutionary</xref> processes denied all biblical concepts of divine creation.

At the turn of the 20th century, some thinkers in both Britain and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref> optimistically reworked their doctrine of God in congruence with evolutionary thought.

                According to the original Christian understanding of God of the early church, the Middle Ages, and the Reformation, God neither is solitary nor wishes to be alone. Instead, God is encircled with a boundless realm of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="24463" tocid="">angels</xref>, created in the divine image. They surround God in freely expressed love and devotion. They appear in a graduated, individuated hierarchy. These ranks of angels offer God their praise, and they appear active in the universe as messengers and executors of the divine will. From the beginning God appears as the ruler and centre in this divinely fashioned realm, and the first created of this realm are the angels. The church of the angels is the upper church; the earthly church joins with them in the “cherubic hymn,” the Trisagion (“Holy, Holy, Holy”), at the epiphany of the Lord and with the angelic choirs surrounding him in the Eucharist. The earthly church is thus viewed as a participant—co-liturgist—in the angelic liturgy. Because the angels are created as free spiritual beings in accordance with the image of God, the first fall takes place in their midst—the first misuse of freedom was in the rebellion of the highest prince of the angels, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="350593" tocid="">Lucifer</xref> (“Light-bearer”), against God.

                </thumbasm>In the Bible, especially the New Testament, <xref refid="1631372" ty="1" topicid="524816" tocid="">Satan</xref> (the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="160173" tocid="">devil</xref>) comes to appear as the representative of evil. Enlightenment thinkers endeavoured to push the figure of the devil out of Christian consciousness as being a product of the fantasy of the Middle Ages. It is precisely in this figure, however, that some aspects of the ways God deals with evil are especially evident. The devil first appears as an independent figure alongside God in the Hebrew Scriptures. There evil is still brought into a direct relationship with God; even evil, insofar as it has power and life, is effected by God: “I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe, I am the Lord, who do all these things” (Isaiah 45:7).
              </p>
              <p>
                In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304284" tocid="">the Book of Job</xref>, Satan appears as the partner of God, who on behalf of God puts the righteous one to the test. Only in postbiblical Judaism does the devil become the adversary of God, the prince of angels, who, created by God and placed at the head of the angelic hosts, entices some of the angels into revolt against God. In punishment for his rebellion he is cast from heaven together with his mutinous entourage, which were transformed into demons. As ruler over the fallen angels he continues the struggle against the Kingdom of God by seeking to seduce humans into sin, by trying to disrupt God’s plan for salvation, and by appearing before God as a slanderer and accuser of saints, so as to reduce the number of those chosen for the Kingdom of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, Satan is a creature of God, who has his being and essence from God; he is the partner of God in the drama of the history of salvation; and he is the rival of God, who fights against God’s plan of salvation. Through the influence of the dualistic thinking of <xref refid="1631404" ty="1" topicid="658081" tocid="">Zoroastrian</xref> religion during the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="47693" tocid="">Babylonian Exile</xref> (586–538 <e ty="s">bc</e>) in Persia, Satan took on features of a countergod in late Judaism. In the writings of the Qumran sects (who preserved the <xref refid="1631405" ty="1" topicid="154274" tocid="">Dead Sea Scrolls</xref>), Belial, the “angel of darkness” and the “spirit of wickedness,” appears as the adversary of the “prince of luminaries” and the “spirit of truth.” The conclusion of the history of salvation is the eschatological battle of the prince of luminaries against Belial, which ends with judgment upon him, his angels, and people subject to him and ushers in the cessation of “worry, groaning, and wickedness” and the beginning of the rule of “truth.”
              </p>
              <p>
                In the New Testament the features of an anti-godly power are clearly prominent in the figures of the devil, Satan, Belial, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="58374" tocid="">Beelzebub</xref>—the “enemy.” He is the accuser, the evil one, the tempter, the old snake, the great dragon, the prince of this world, and the god of this world, who seeks to hinder the establishment of God’s dominion through the life and suffering of Jesus Christ. Satan offers to give to Christ the riches of this world if Christ will acknowledge him as supreme lord. Thus, he is the real antagonist of the Messiah–Son of man, Christ, who is sent by God into the world to destroy the works of Satan.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is lacking, however, the possibility of incarnation: he is left to rob others in order to procure for himself the appearance of personality and corporeality. As opposed to <e>philanthrōpia</e>, the love of man of Christ, who presents himself as an expiatory sacrifice for the sins of humankind out of love for it, Satan appears among early church teachers, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">Basil of Caesarea</xref> in the 4th century, as the <e>misanthrōpos</e>, the hater of humanity; vis-à-vis the bringer of heavenly beauty, he is the hater of beauty, the <e>misokalos</e>. With <xref refid="1770073" ty="1" topicid="236343" tocid="">Gnosticism</xref> (a loose collection of sects or movements that postulated a transcendent god and a lesser, creator god), dualistic features also penetrated the Christian sphere of intuitive vision. In the <e>Letter of Barnabas</e> (early 2nd century), Satan appeared as “the Black One”; according to the 2nd-century apologist Athenagoras, he is “the one entrusted with the administration of matter and its forms of appearance,” “the spirit hovering above matter.” Under the influence of Gnosticism and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="362167" tocid="">Manichaeism</xref> (a syncretistic religion founded by Mani, a 3rd-century Persian prophet), there also followed—based on their dualistic aspects—the demonization of the entire realm of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="537209" tocid="">sexual</xref>. This appears as the special temptational sphere of the devil; in sexual activity, the role of the instrument of diabolic enticement devolves upon woman. Dualistic tendencies remained a permanent undercurrent in the church and determined, to a great extent, the understanding of sin and redemption. Satan remained the prototype of sin as the rebel who does not come to terms with fulfilling his godlikeness in love to his original image and Creator but instead desires equality with God and places love of self over love of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the early <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Fathers</xref>, the idea of Satan as the antagonist of Christ led to a mythical interpretation of the incarnation and disguise in the “form of a servant.” Through this disguise the Son of God makes his heavenly origin unrecognizable to Satan. In some medieval depictions Christ appears as the “bait” cast before Satan, after which Satan grasps because he believes Christ to be an ordinary human being subject to his power. In the Middle Ages a further feature was added: the understanding of the devil as the “ape of God,” who attempts to imitate God through spurious, malicious creations that he interpolates for, or opposes to, the divine creations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Christian historical consciousness the figure of Satan plays an important role, not least of all through the influence of the <xref refid="1631415" ty="1" topicid="500324" tocid="">Revelation to John</xref>. The history of salvation is understood as the history of the struggle between God and the demonic antagonist, who with constantly new means tries to thwart God’s plan of salvation. The idea of the “stratagems of Satan,” as developed by a 16th-century fortress engineer, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="3938" tocid="">Giacomo Aconcio</xref>, had its roots here. This altercation constitutes the religious background of the drama of world history. Characteristic here is the impetus of acceleration already indicated in Revelation: blow and counterblow in the struggle taking place between God and Satan follow in ever shorter intervals; for the devil “knows that his time is short” (Revelation 12:12), and his power in heaven has already been laid low. On Earth the possibility of his efficacy is likewise limited by the return of the Lord. Hence, his attacks upon the elect of the Kingdom so increase in the last times that God is moved to curtail the days of the final affliction, for “if those days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved” (Matthew 24:22). Many of these features were retained in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497132" tocid="">philosophy of religion</xref> of German idealism as well as in Russian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497132" tocid="">philosophy of religion</xref>. According to the 20th-century Russian philosopher <xref refid="1631428" ty="1" topicid="61564" tocid="">Nikolay Berdyayev</xref>, like the Germans <xref refid="1631430" ty="1" topicid="527203" tocid="">Friedrich Schelling</xref> and <xref refid="1631432" ty="1" topicid="47224" tocid="">Franz von Baader</xref> before him, the devil has no true personality and no genuine reality and, instead, is filled with an insatiable “hunger for reality,” which he can attain by stealing reality from the people of whom he takes possession.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the Enlightenment, Christian theologians who found the mythical pictures of Satan to be irrelevant, distorting, or confusing in Christian thought and experience have set out to demythologize this figure. Apologists such as the British literary figure <xref refid="1631437" ty="1" topicid="338121" tocid="">C.S. Lewis</xref> and the Russian philosopher <xref refid="1631439" ty="1" topicid="553647" tocid="">Vladimir Solovyov</xref>, however, have written cautionary words against this trend. They conceive that it would represent the devil’s most cunning attempt at self-camouflage to be demythologized and that camouflage would be a certain new proof of his existence.

              </thumbasm>Dogmatic teachings about the figure of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> go back to the faith experiences of the original church. The faithful of the early church experienced and recognized the incarnate and resurrected Son of God in the person of Jesus. The disciples’ testimony served as confirmation for them that Jesus really is the exalted Lord and Son of God, who sits at the right hand of the Father and will return in glory to consummate the Kingdom.

              <headtitle>Different interpretations of the person of Jesus</headtitle>
              <p>
                From the beginning of the church different interpretations of the person of Jesus have existed alongside one another. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365604" tocid="">The Gospel According to Mark</xref>, for example, understands Jesus as the man upon whom the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> descends at the baptism in the Jordan and about whom the voice of God declares from the heavens, “You are my beloved son” (Mark 1:11). The teaching in Mark’s Gospel provided the foundation for one of two early schools of thought concerning the person of Christ. Approaches to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115761" tocid="">Christology</xref> that derive from the theological <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28327" tocid="">school of Antioch</xref> have followed one line of interpretation: they proceed from the humanity of Jesus and view his divinity in his consciousness of God, founded in the divine mission that was imposed upon him by God through the infusion of the Holy Spirit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another view, adopted by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14441" tocid="">school of Alexandria</xref>, is expressed by The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref>, which regards the figure of Jesus Christ as the divine <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref> become flesh. Here, the divinity of the person of Jesus is understood not as the endowment of the man Jesus with a divine power but rather as the result of the descent of the divine Logos—a preexistent heavenly being—into the world: the Logos taking on a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275485" tocid="">human body</xref> of flesh so as to be realized in history. Thus it was that the struggle to understand the figure of Jesus Christ created a rivalry between the theologies of Antioch and Alexandria. Both schools had a wide sphere of influence, not only among the contemporary clergy but also among the monks and the laity.

                The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115761" tocid="">Christological</xref> controversies
              </headtitle>
              <p>
                As in the area of the doctrine of the Trinity, the general development of Christology has been characterized by a plurality of views and formulations. Solutions intermediate between the positions of Antioch and Alexandria were constantly proposed. During the 5th century the heresy of Nestorianism, with its strong emphasis upon the human aspects of Jesus Christ, arose from the Antiochene school, and the heresy of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="389961" tocid="">Monophysitism</xref>, with its one-sided stress upon the divine nature of Christ, emerged from the Alexandrian school. After Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, the great ecumenical synods occupied themselves essentially with the task of creating uniform formulations binding upon the entire imperial church. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="104580" tocid="">Council of Chalcedon</xref> (451) finally settled the dispute between Antioch and Alexandria by drawing from each, declaring: “We all unanimously teach…one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect in deity and perfect in humanity…in two natures, without being mixed, transmuted, divided, or separated. The distinction between the natures is by no means done away with through the union, but rather the identity of each nature is preserved and concurs into one person and being.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Even the Christological formulas, however, do not claim to offer a rational, conceptual clarification; instead, they emphasize clearly three contentions in the mystery of the sonship of God. These are: first, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is completely God, that in reality “the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily” in him (Colossians 2:9); second, that he is completely human; and third, that these two “natures” do not exist beside one another in an unconnected way but, rather, are joined in him in a personal unity. Once again, the Neoplatonic metaphysics of substance offered the categories so as to settle conceptually these various theological concerns. Thus, the idea of the unity of essence (<e>homoousia</e>) of the divine Logos with God the Father assured the complete divinity of Jesus Christ, and the mystery of the person of Jesus Christ could be grasped in a complex but decisive formula: two natures in one person. The concept of person, taken from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref>, served to join the fully divine and fully human natures of Christ into an individual unity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christology, however, is not the product of abstract, logical operations but instead originates in the liturgical and charismatic sphere wherein Christians engage in prayer, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="372609" tocid="">meditation</xref>, and asceticism. Not being derived primarily from abstract teaching, it rather changes within the liturgy in new forms and in countless hymns of worship—as in the words of the Easter liturgy:<qt>
                  <qtpara>The king of the heavens appeared on earth out of kindness to man and it was with men that he associated. For he took his flesh from a pure virgin and he came forth from her, in that he accepted it. One is the Son, two-fold in essence, but not in person. Therefore in announcing him as in truth perfect God and perfect man, we confess Christ our God.</qtpara>

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="377146" tocid="">Messianic</xref> views
              </headtitle>
              <p>
                Faith in Jesus Christ is related in the closest way to faith in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>, the coming of which he proclaimed and introduced. Christian eschatological expectations, for their part, were joined with the messianic promises, which underwent a decisive transformation and differentiation in late Judaism, especially in the two centuries just before the appearance of Jesus. Two basic types can be distinguished as influencing the messianic self-understanding of Jesus as well as the faith of his disciples.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional Jewish view of the fulfillment of the history of salvation was guided by the idea that at the end of history the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="377146" tocid="">messiah</xref> will come from the house of David and establish the Kingdom of God—an earthly kingdom in which the Anointed of the Lord will gather the tribes of the chosen people and from Jerusalem will establish a world kingdom of peace. Accordingly, the expectation of the Kingdom had an explicitly inner-worldly character. The expectation of an earthly messiah as the founder of a Jewish kingdom became the strongest impulse for political revolutions, primarily against Hellenistic and Roman dominion. The period preceding the appearance of Jesus was filled with uprisings in which new messianic personalities appeared and claimed for themselves and their struggles for liberation the miraculous powers of the Kingdom of God. Especially in Galilee, guerrilla groups were formed in which hope for a better future blazed all the more fiercely because the present was so unpromising.
              </p>
              <p>Jesus disappointed the political expectations of these popular circles; he did not let himself be made a political messiah. Conversely, it was his opponents who used the political misinterpretation of his person to destroy him. Jesus was condemned and executed by the Roman authorities as a Jewish rioter who rebelled against Roman sovereignty. The inscription on the cross, “Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews,” cited the motif of political insurrection of a Jewish messianic king against the Roman government as the official reason for his condemnation and execution.</p>
              <p>
                Alongside worldly or political messianism there was a second form of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="192308" tocid="">eschatological</xref> expectation. Its supporters were the pious groups in the country, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="193097" tocid="">Essenes</xref> and the Qumran community on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154254" tocid="">Dead Sea</xref>. Their yearning was directed not toward an earthly messiah but toward a heavenly one, who would bring not an earthly but a heavenly kingdom. These pious ones wanted to know nothing of sword and struggle, uprising and rebellion. They believed that the wondrous power of God alone would create the new time. The birth of a new eon would be preceded by intense trials and tribulations and a frightful judgment upon the godless, the pagan peoples, and Satan with his demonic powers. The messiah would come not as an earthly king from the house of David but as a heavenly figure, as the Son of God, a heavenly being, who would descend into the world of the Evil One and there gather his own to lead them back into the realm of light. He would take up dominion of the world and, after overcoming all earthly and supernatural demonic powers, lay the entire cosmos at the feet of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                A second new feature, anticipation of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499816" tocid="">Resurrection</xref>, was coupled with this transcending of the old expectation. According to traditional Jewish eschatological expectation, the beneficiaries of the divine development of the world would be only the members of the last generation of humanity who were fortunate enough to experience the arrival of the messiah upon Earth; all earlier generations would be consumed with the longing for fulfillment but would die without experiencing it. Ancient Judaism knew no hope of resurrection. In connection with the transcending of the expectation of the Kingdom of God, however, even anticipations of resurrection voiced earlier by <xref refid="1770100" ty="1" topicid="658081" tocid="">Zoroastrianism</xref> were achieved: the Kingdom of God was to include within itself in the state of resurrection all the faithful of every generation of humanity. Even the faithful of the earlier generations would find in resurrection the realization of their faith. In the new eon the Messiah–Son of man would rule over the resurrected faithful of all times and all peoples. A characteristic breaking free of the eschatological expectation was thereby presented. It no longer referred exclusively to the Jews alone; with its transcendence a universalistic feature entered into it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jesus—in contrast to <xref refid="1631528" ty="1" topicid="305173" tocid="">John the Baptist</xref> (a preacher of repentance who pointed to the coming bringer of the Kingdom)—knew himself to be the one who brought fulfillment of the Kingdom itself, because the wondrous powers of the Kingdom of God were already at work in him. He proclaimed the good news that the long promised Kingdom was already dawning, that the consummation was here. This is what was new: the promised Kingdom, supra-worldly, of the future, the coming new eon, already reached redeemingly into the this-worldly from its beyond-ness, as a charismatic reality that brought people together in a new community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jesus did not simply transfer to himself the promise of heavenly Son of man, as it was articulated in the apocryphal <xref refid="1631529" ty="1" topicid="188588" tocid="">First Book of Enoch</xref>. Instead, he gave this expectation of the Son of man an entirely new interpretation. Pious Jewish circles, such as the Enoch community and other pietist groups, expected in the coming Son of man a figure of light from on high, a heavenly conquering hero, with all the marks of divine power and glory. Jesus, however, linked expectations of the Son of man with the figure of the suffering servant of God (as in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295133" tocid="">Isaiah</xref>, chapter 53). He would return in glory as the consummator of the Kingdom.

                </thumbasm>The dogma of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Virgin Mary</xref> as the “mother of God” and “bearer of God” is connected in the closest way with the dogma of the incarnation of the divine Logos. The theoretical formation of doctrine did not bring the veneration of the mother of God along in its train; instead, the doctrine only reflected the unusually great role that this veneration already had taken on at an early date in the liturgy and in the church piety of orthodox faithful.
              </p>
              <p>
                The expansion of the veneration of the Virgin Mary as the bearer of God (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="591153" tocid="">Theotokos</xref>) and the formation of the corresponding dogma comprise one of the most astonishing occurrences in the history of the early church. The New Testament offers only scanty points of departure for this development. Although she has a prominent place in the narratives of the Nativity and the Passion of Christ, Mary completely recedes behind the figure of Jesus, who stands in the centre of all four Gospels. From the Gospels themselves it can be recognized that Jesus’ development into the preacher of the Kingdom of God took place in sharp opposition to his family, who were so little convinced of his mission that they held him to be insane (Mark 3:21); in a later passage Jesus refuses to recognize them (Mark 3:31). Accordingly, all the Gospels stress the fact that Jesus separated himself from his family. Even The Gospel According to John still preserved traces of Jesus’ tense relationship with his mother. Mary appears twice without being called by name the mother of Jesus; and Jesus himself regularly withholds from her the designation of mother.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, with the conception of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, a tendency developed early in the church to grant to the mother of the Son of God a special place within the church. This development was sketched quite hesitantly in the New Testament. Only the Gospels of Matthew and Luke mention the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629896" tocid="">virgin birth</xref>. On these scanty presuppositions the later veneration of the mother of God was developed. The view of the virgin birth entered into the creed of all Christianity and became one of the strongest religious impulses in the development of the dogma, liturgy, and ecclesiastical piety of the early church.

                Veneration of the mother of God received its impetus when the Christian Church became the imperial church. Despite the lack of detail concerning Mary in the Gospels, cultic veneration of the divine virgin and mother found within the Christian Church a new possibility of expression in the worship of Mary as the virgin mother of God, in whom was achieved the mysterious union of the divine Logos with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275811" tocid="">human nature</xref>. The spontaneous impulse of popular piety, which pushed in this direction, moved far in advance of the practice and doctrine of the church. In Egypt, Mary was, at an early point, already worshiped under the title of Theotokos—an expression that Origen used in the 3rd century. The Council of Ephesus (431) raised this designation to a dogmatic standard. To the latter, the second <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134028" tocid="">Council of Constantinople</xref> (553) added the title “eternal Virgin.” In the prayers and hymns of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref> the name of the mother of God is invoked as often as is the name of Christ and the Holy Trinity.
              </p>
              <p>The doctrine of the heavenly Wisdom (Sophia) represents an Eastern Church particularity. In late Judaism, speculations about the heavenly Wisdom—a figure beside God that presents itself to humanity as mediator in the work of creation as well as mediator of the knowledge of God—abounded. In Roman Catholic doctrine, Mary, the mother of God, was identified with the figure of the divine Wisdom. To borrow a term used in Christology to describe Jesus as being of the same substance (hypostasis) as the Father, Mary was seen as possessing a divine hypostasis.</p>
              <p>
                This process of treating Mary and the heavenly Wisdom alike did not take place in the realm of the Eastern Orthodox Church. For all its veneration of the mother of God, the Eastern Orthodox Church never forgot that the root of this veneration lay in the incarnation of the divine Logos that took place through her. Accordingly, in the tradition of Orthodox theology, a specific doctrine of the heavenly Wisdom, Sophianism, is found alongside the doctrine of the mother of God. This distinction between the mother of God and the heavenly Sophia in 20th-century Russian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497132" tocid="">philosophy of religion</xref> (in the works of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="553647" tocid="">Vladimir Solovyov</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="210727" tocid="">Pavel Florensky</xref>, W.N. Iljin, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="84064" tocid="">Sergey Bulgakov</xref>) developed a special Sophianism. Sophianism did, however, evoke the opposition of Orthodox academic theology. The numerous great churches of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="251562" tocid="">Hagia Sophia</xref>, foremost among them the cathedral by that name in Constantinople (Istanbul), are consecrated to this figure of the heavenly Wisdom.

                The Holy Spirit is one of the most elusive and difficult themes in Christian theology, because it refers to one of the three persons in the Godhead but does not evoke concrete images the way “Father” or “Creator” and “Son” or “Redeemer” do. A characteristic view of the Holy Spirit is sketched in The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref>: the outpouring of the Holy Spirit takes place only after the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="37838" tocid="">Ascension</xref> of Christ; it is the beginning of a new time of salvation, in which the Holy Spirit is sent as the Paraclete (Counsellor) to the church remaining behind in this world. The phenomena described in John, which are celebrated in the church at <xref refid="1631569" ty="1" topicid="450394" tocid="">Pentecost</xref>, are understood as the fulfillment of this promise. With this event (Pentecost), the church entered into the period of the Holy Spirit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The essence of the expression of the Holy Spirit is free spontaneity. The Spirit blows like the wind, “where it wills,” but where it blows it establishes a firm norm by virtue of its divine authority. The spirit of prophecy and the spirit of knowledge (<e>gnōsis</e>) are not subject to the will of the prophet; revelation of the Spirit in the prophetic word or in the word of knowledge becomes Holy Scripture, which as “divinely breathed” “cannot be broken” and lays claim to a lasting validity for the church.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Spirit, which is expressed in the various officeholders of the church, likewise founds the authority of ecclesiastical offices. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="254238" tocid="">laying on of hands</xref>, as a sign of the transference of the Holy Spirit from one person to another, is a characteristic ritual that visibly represents and guarantees the continuity of the working of the Spirit in the officeholders chosen by the Apostles. It is, in other words, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515366" tocid="">sacramental</xref> sign of the succession of the full power of spiritual authority of bishops and priests. The Holy Spirit also creates the sacraments and guarantees the constancy of their action in the church. All the expressions of church life—doctrine, office, polity, sacraments, power to loosen and to bind, and prayer—are understood as endowed by the Spirit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Holy Spirit, however, is also the revolutionizing, freshly creating principle in church history. All the reformational movements in church history, which broke with old institutions, have appealed to the authority of the Holy Spirit. Opposition to the church—through appeal to the Holy Spirit—became noticeable for the first time in <xref refid="1631570" ty="1" topicid="390561" tocid="">Montanism</xref>, in the mid-2nd century. <xref refid="1631571" ty="1" topicid="390572" tocid="">Montanus</xref>, a Phrygian prophet and charismatic leader, understood himself and the prophetic movement sustained by him as the fulfillment of the promise of the coming of the Paraclete. In the 13th century a spiritualistic countermovement against the institutional church gained attention anew in <xref refid="1631572" ty="1" topicid="304176" tocid="">Joachim of Fiore</xref>, who understood the history of salvation in terms of a continuing self-realization of the divine Trinity in the three times of salvation: (1) the time of the Father, (2) the time of the Son, and (3) the time of the Holy Spirit. He promised the speedy beginning of the period of the Holy Spirit, in which the institutional papal church, with its sacraments and its revelation hardened in the letter of scripture, would be replaced by a community of charismatic figures, filled with the Spirit, and by the time of “spiritual knowledge.” This promise became the spiritual stimulus of a series of revolutionary movements within the medieval church—e.g., the reform movement of the radical <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="216835" tocid="">Franciscan</xref> spirituals. Their effects extended to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="277581" tocid="">Hussite</xref> reform movement led by <xref refid="1631573" ty="1" topicid="277400" tocid="">Jan Hus</xref> in 15th-century Bohemia and to the 16th-century radical reformer, <xref refid="1631574" ty="1" topicid="397713" tocid="">Thomas Müntzer</xref>, who substantiated his revolution against the princes and clerical hierarchs with a new outpouring of the Spirit. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="220221" tocid="">Quakerism</xref> represents the most radical mode of rejection—carried out in the name of the freedom of the Holy Spirit—of all institutional forms, which are regarded as shackles and prisons of the Holy Spirit.

              <p>
                As the uncontrollable principle of life in the church, the Holy Spirit considerably upset Christian congregations from the very outset. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> struggled to restrict the anarchist elements, which are connected with the appearance of free charismata (spiritual phenomena), and, over against these, to achieve a firm order in the church. Paul at times attempted to control and even repress charismatic activities, which he seemed to regard as irrational or prerational and thus potentially disruptive of fellowship. Among these were <xref refid="1631606" ty="1" topicid="599257" tocid="">glossolalia</xref>, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="599257" tocid="">speaking in tongues</xref>, a form of unrepressed speech.

He also felt that spontaneity threatened the focus of worship, even though he himself claimed to possess this gift in extraordinary measure and the Apostles spoke in tongues at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450394" tocid="">Pentecost</xref>. This tendency led to an emphasis on ecclesiastical offices with their limited authority vis-à-vis the uncontrolled appearance of free charismatic figures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conflict between church leadership resident in the locality and the appearance of free charismatic figures in the form of itinerant preachers forms the main motif of the oldest efforts to establish church order. This difficulty became evident in the <e>

                </e>, the <e>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</e> (early 2nd century). The authority of the Holy Spirit, in whose name the free charismatic figures claim to speak, does not allow its instructions and prophecies to be criticized in terms of contents; its evaluation had to be made dependent upon purely ethical qualifications. This tension ended, in practical terms, with the exclusion of the free charismatic figures from the leadership of the church. The charismatic continuation of the revelation, in the form of new scriptures of revelation, was also checked. In the long historical process during which the Christian biblical canon took shape, Bishop <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">Athanasius</xref> of Alexandria, in his 39th Easter letter (367), selected the number of writings—of apostolic origin—that he considered “canonical.” Revelation in the form of Holy Scriptures binding for the Christian faith was thereby considered definitively concluded and, therefore, could no longer be changed, abridged, or supplemented.

                The church <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142374" tocid="">creeds</xref> reflect little of these struggles and suppress the revolutionary principle of the Holy Spirit. Neither the so-called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30242" tocid="">Apostles’ Creed</xref> nor the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref> goes beyond establishment of faith in the Holy Spirit and its participation in the incarnation.

              </p>
              <p>
                The emergence of Trinitarian speculations in early church theology led to great difficulties in the article about the “person” of the Holy Spirit. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit appeared more as power than as person, though there was distinctive personal representation in the form of the dove at Jesus’ baptism. But it was difficult to incorporate this graphic or symbolic representation into dogmatic theology. Nevertheless, the idea of the complete essence (<e>homoousia</e>) of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son was achieved through the writings of Athanasius. This was in opposition to all earlier attempts to subordinate the Holy Spirit to the Son and to the Father and to interpret the Spirit—similarly to anti-Trinitarian Christology—as a prince of the angels. According to Athanasius, the Holy Spirit alone guarantees the complete redemption of humanity: “through participation in the Holy Spirit we partake of the divine nature.” In his work <e>De Trinitate</e> (“On the Trinity”), Augustine undertook to render the essence of the Trinity understandable in terms of the Trinitarian structure of the human person: the Holy Spirit appears as the Spirit of love, which joins Father and Son and draws people into this communion of love. In Eastern Orthodox thought, however, the Holy Spirit and the Son both proceed from the Father. In the West, the divine Trinity is determined more by the idea of the inner Trinitarian life in God; thus, the notion was carried through that the Holy Spirit goes forth from the Father and from the Son. Despite all the efforts of speculative theology, a graphic conception of the person of the Holy Spirit was not developed even later in the consciousness of the church.

                For the Christian faith, the Holy Spirit is clearly recognizable in charismatic figures (the saints), in whom the gifts of grace (charismata) of the Holy Spirit are expressed in different forms: reformers and other charismatic figures. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479082" tocid="">prophet</xref>, for instance, belongs to these charismatic types. The history of the church knows a continuous series of prophetic types, beginning with New Testament prophets, such as Agabus (in Acts 11:28), and continuing with the 12th-century monk <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="62413" tocid="">Bernard of Clairvaux</xref> and such reformers as Luther and Calvin. Christoph Kotter and Nicolaus Drabicius—prophets of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="592619" tocid="">Thirty Years’ War</xref> period—were highly praised by the 17th-century Moravian bishop <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127493" tocid="">John Amos Comenius</xref>. Other prophets have existed in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="459967" tocid="">Pietism</xref>, Puritanism, and the Free churches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prophetic women are especially numerous. In church history they begin with Anna (in Luke 2:36) and the prophetic daughters of the apostle <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="455969" tocid="">Philip</xref>. Others are: <xref refid="1631740" ty="1" topicid="265747" tocid="">Hildegard of Bingen</xref>, <xref refid="1631741" ty="1" topicid="79367" tocid="">Bridget of Sweden</xref>, <xref refid="1631742" ty="1" topicid="304220" tocid="">Joan of Arc</xref>, and the prophetic women of the Reformation period. In the modern world numbers of pioneers in the “holiness” and Pentecostal traditions, such as <xref refid="1631743" ty="1" topicid="355270" tocid="">Aimee Semple McPherson</xref>, were women, and women’s gifts of prophecy have sometimes been cherished among Pentecostalists when they were overlooked or disdained by much of the rest of Christianity.
              </p>
              <p>
                A further type of charismatic person is the healer, who functioned in the early church as an exorcist but who also emerged as a charismatic type in healing personalities of more recent church history (e.g., Vincent de Paul in the 17th century). Equally significant is the curer-of-souls type, who exercises the gift of “distinguishing between spirits” in daily association with people. This gift is believed to have been possessed by many of the great saints of all times. In the 19th century it stands out in Johann Christoph Blumhardt, in Protestantism, and in Jean-Baptiste Vianney, the curé of Ars, in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholicism</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “holy fool” type conceals a radical Christianity under the mask of foolishness and holds the truth of the gospel, in the disguise of folly, before the eyes of highly placed personalities: the worldly and the princes of the church who do not brook unmasked truth. This type, which frequently appeared in the Byzantine Church, has been represented especially in Western Christianity by <xref refid="1631769" ty="1" topicid="409470" tocid="">Philip Neri</xref>, the founder of the religious order known as the Oratorians, in the 16th century.

                The charismatic teacher (<e>didaskalos</e>), on the other hand, still appears. Filled with the spirit of intelligence or knowledge of the Holy Spirit, he carries out his teaching office, which does not necessarily need to be attached to an academic position. Many Free Church and ecclesiastical reform movements owe their genesis to such spirit-filled teachers, who are often decried as anomalous. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154196" tocid="">deacon</xref> likewise is originally the holder of a charismatic office of selfless service. Christian service, or <e>diakonia</e>, was not confined to Christian offices. Some of the energies that once went into it are now found in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551426" tocid="">social service</xref> outside the church. Many of the agents of such service were originally or still may be inspired by Christian norms and examples in the care of the sick and the socially outcast or overlooked.

              <p>The Holy Spirit that “blows where it wills” has often been recognized as the impulse behind an enlargement of roles for women in the church. However limited these have been, they enlarged upon those that Christians inherited from Judaism. Partitions had screened women in a special left-hand section of the synagogue. While the pace of innovation was irregular, in the ecstatic worship services of the Christian congregations women tended to participate in speaking in tongues, hymns, prayer calls, or even prophecies. Evidently, this innovation was held admissible on the basis of the authority of the Holy Spirit: “Do not quench the Spirit” (1 Thessalonians 5:19). Inasmuch as the appearance of charismatic women upset traditional concepts, however, Paul reverted to the synagogal principle and inhibited the speaking role of women: “the women should keep silence in the churches.” (1 Corinthians 14:34).</p>
              <p>
                Because expressions of free charisma were increasingly suppressed in the institutional churches, the emergence of <xref refid="1631776" ty="1" topicid="450414" tocid="">Pentecostal</xref> movements outside the institutional churches and partly in open opposition to them arose. This movement led to the founding of various Pentecostal Free churches at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th; it is represented through numerous independent Pentecostal groups, such as the <xref refid="1631773" ty="1" topicid="236606" tocid="">Church of God</xref> and the <xref refid="1631774" ty="1" topicid="39225" tocid="">Assemblies of God</xref>.

                </thumbasm>The central Christian affirmations about God are condensed and focused in the classic doctrine of the Trinity, which has its ultimate foundation in the special religious experience of the Christians in the first communities. This basis of experience is older than the doctrine of the Trinity. It consisted of the fact that God came to meet Christians in a threefold figure: (1) as Creator, Lord of the history of salvation, Father, and Judge, as revealed in the Old Testament; (2) as the Lord who, in the figure of Jesus Christ, lived among <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> and was present in their midst as the “Resurrected One”; and (3) as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref>, whom they experienced as the power of the new life, the miraculous potency of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>. The question as to how to reconcile the encounter with God in this threefold figure with faith in the oneness of God, which was the Jews’ and Christians’ characteristic mark of distinction from paganism, agitated the piety of ancient Christendom in the deepest way. In the course of history, it also provided the strongest impetus for a speculative theology, which inspired Western metaphysics for many centuries. In the first two centuries of the Christian Era, however, a series of different answers to this question developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The diversity in interpretation of the Trinity was conditioned especially through the understanding of the figure of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. According to the theology of The Gospel According to John, the divinity of Jesus Christ constituted the departure point for understanding his person and efficacy. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="365604" tocid="">The Gospel According to Mark</xref>, however, did not proceed from a theology of incarnation but instead understood the baptism of Jesus Christ as the adoption of the man Jesus Christ into the Sonship of God, accomplished through the descent of the Holy Spirit. The situation became further aggravated by the conceptions of the special personal character of the manifestation of God developed by way of the historical figure of Jesus Christ; the Holy Spirit was viewed not as a personal figure but rather as a power and appeared graphically only in the form of the dove and thus receded, to a large extent, in the Trinitarian speculation.

                Introduction of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409036" tocid="">Neoplatonic</xref> themes
              </headtitle>
              <p>
                The Johannine literature in the Bible provides the first traces of the concept of Christ as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref>, the “word” or “principle” that issues from eternity. Under the influence of subsequent Neoplatonic philosophy, this tradition became central in speculative theology. There was interest in the relationship of the “oneness” of God to the “triplicity” of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590940" tocid="">divine manifestations</xref>. This question was answered through the Neoplatonic metaphysics of being. The transcendent God, who is beyond all being, all rationality, and all conceptuality, is divested of divine transcendence. In a first act of becoming self-conscious the Logos recognizes itself as the divine mind (Greek: <e>nous</e>), or divine world reason, which was characterized by the Neoplatonic philosopher <xref refid="1769998" ty="1" topicid="464926" tocid="">Plotinus</xref> as the “Son” who goes forth from the Father. The next step by which the transcendent God becomes self-conscious consists in the appearance in the divine <e>nous</e> of the divine world, the idea of the world in its individual forms as the content of the divine consciousness. In Neoplatonic philosophy both the <e>nous</e> and the idea of the world are designated the hypostases of the transcendent God. Christian theology took the Neoplatonic metaphysics of substance as well as its doctrine of hypostases as the departure point for interpreting the relationship of the “Father” to the “Son.” This process stands in direct relationship with a speculative interpretation of Christology in connection with Neoplatonic Logos speculation.

              <p>In transferring the Neoplatonic hypostases doctrine to the Christian interpretation of the Trinity there existed the danger that the different manifestations of God—as known by the Christian experience of faith: Father, Son, Holy Spirit—would be transformed into a hierarchy of gods graduated among themselves and thus into a polytheism. Though this danger was consciously avoided and, proceeding from a Logos Christology, the complete sameness of essence of the three manifestations of God was emphasized, there arose the danger of a relapse into a triplicity of equally ranked gods, which would displace the idea of the oneness of God.</p>

              <headtitle>Attempts to define the Trinity</headtitle>
              <p>
                By the 3rd century it was already apparent that all attempts to systematize the mystery of the divine Trinity with the theories of Neoplatonic hypostases metaphysics were unsatisfying and led to a series of new conflicts. The high point of these conflicts was the so-called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="34124" tocid="">Arian</xref> controversy. In his interpretation of the idea of God, <xref refid="1769999" ty="1" topicid="34795" tocid="">Arius</xref> sought to maintain a formal understanding of the oneness of God. In defense of that oneness, he was obliged to dispute the sameness of essence of the Son and the Holy Spirit with God the Father, as stressed by other theologians of his day. From the outset, the controversy between both parties took place upon the common basis of the Neoplatonic concept of substance, which was foreign to the New Testament itself. It is no wonder that the continuation of the dispute on the basis of the metaphysics of substance likewise led to concepts that have no foundation in the New Testament—such as the question of the sameness of essence (<e>homoousia</e>) or similarity of essence (<e>homoiousia</e>) of the divine persons.
              </p>
              <p>The basic concern of Arius was and remained disputing the oneness of essence of the Son and the Holy Spirit with God the Father, in order to preserve the oneness of God. The Son, thus, became a “second God, under God the Father”—i.e., he is a divine figure begotten by God. The Son is not himself God, a creature that was willed by God, made like God by divine grace, and sent as a mediator between God and humankind. Arius’s teaching was intended to defend the idea of the oneness of the Christian concept of God against all reproaches that Christianity introduces a new, more sublime form of polytheism.</p>
              <p>This attempt to save the oneness of God led, however, to an awkward consequence. For Jesus Christ, as the divine Logos become human, moves thereby to the side of the creatures—i.e., to the side of the created world that needs redemption. How, then, should such a Christ, himself a part of the creation, be able to achieve the redemption of the world? On the whole, the Christian Church rejected, as an unhappy attack upon the reality of redemption, such a formal attempt at saving the oneness of God as was undertaken by Arius.</p>

                </thumbasm>Arius’s main rival was <xref refid="1770000" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">Athanasius</xref> of Alexandria, for whom the point of departure was not a philosophical-speculative principle but rather the reality of redemption, the certainty of salvation. The redemption of humanity from sin and death is only then guaranteed if Christ is total God and total human being, if the complete essence of God penetrates <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275811" tocid="">human nature</xref> right into the deepest layer of its carnal corporeality. Only if God in the full meaning of divine essence became human in Jesus Christ is deification of man in terms of overcoming sin and death guaranteed as the resurrection of the flesh. The Athanasian view was accepted at the Council of Nicaea (325) and became orthodox Christian doctrine.

                <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine</xref>, of decisive importance for the development of the Trinitarian doctrine in Western theology and metaphysics, coupled the doctrine of the Trinity with anthropology. Proceeding from the idea that humans are created by God according to the divine image, he attempted to explain the mystery of the Trinity by uncovering traces of the Trinity in the human personality. He went from analysis of the Trinitarian structure of the simple act of cognition to ascertainment of the Trinitarian structure both of human self-consciousness and of the act of religious contemplation in which people recognize themselves as the image of God.
              </p>
              <p>
                A second model of Trinitarian doctrine—suspected of heresy from the outset—which had effects not only in theology but also in the social metaphysics of the West as well, emanated from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304176" tocid="">Joachim of Fiore</xref>. He understood the course of the history of salvation as the successive realization of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in three consecutive periods. This interpretation of the Trinity became effective as a “theology of revolution,” inasmuch as it was regarded as the theological justification of the endeavour to accelerate the arrival of the third state of the Holy Spirit through revolutionary initiative.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final dogmatic formulation of the Trinitarian doctrine in the so-called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40585" tocid="">Athanasian Creed</xref> (<e>c.</e> 500), <e>una substantia—tres personae</e> (“one substance—three persons”), reached back to the formulation of Tertullian. In practical terms it meant a compromise in that it held fast to both basic ideas of Christian revelation—the oneness of God and divine self-revelation in the figures of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—without rationalizing the mystery itself. In the final analysis the point of view thereby remained definitive that the fundamental assumptions of the reality of salvation and redemption are to be retained and not sacrificed to the concern of a rational monotheism.
              </p>
              <p>
                Characteristically, in all periods of the later history of Christianity, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="615330" tocid="">anti-Trinitarian</xref> currents emerged when a rationalistic philosophy questioned the role of the Trinity in the history of salvation. The ideas of Arius were revived by many critics, including the so-called anti-Trinitarians of the Italian Renaissance and the humanists of the 16th century. Researchers into the life of Jesus in the 18th century, such as <xref refid="1632721" ty="1" topicid="496494" tocid="">Hermann Reimarus</xref> and Karl Bahrdt, who portrayed Jesus as the agent of a secret enlightenment order that had set itself the goal of spreading the religion of reason in the world, were at the same time anti-Trinitarians and pioneers of the radical rationalistic criticism of dogma. The Kantian critique of the proofs of God contributed further to a devaluation of Trinitarian doctrine. In German idealism, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259378" tocid="">Hegel</xref>, in the framework of his attempt to raise Christian dogma into the sphere of the conceptual, took the Trinitarian doctrine as the basis for his system of philosophy and, above all, for his interpretation of history as the absolute spirit’s becoming self-conscious. In subsequent theological work, at least in the accusations of some of its critics, the school of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409012" tocid="">dialectical theology</xref> in Europe and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref> tended to reduce the doctrine of the Trinity and supplant it with a monochristism—the teaching that the figure of the Son in the life of faith will overshadow the figure of the Father and thus cause it to disappear and that the figure of the Creator and Sustainer of the world will recede behind the figure of the Redeemer.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a brief but well-publicized episode in the mid-1960s in the United States, a number of celebrated Protestant theologians engaged in cultural criticism observed or announced “the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154552" tocid="">death of God</xref>.” The theology of the death of God downplayed any notion of divine transcendence and invested its whole claim to be Christian in its accent on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus of Nazareth</xref>. Christian dogma was reinterpreted and reduced to norms of human sociality and freedom. Before long, however, the majority of theologians confronted this small school with the demands of classic Christian dogma, which insisted on confronting divine transcendence in any assertions about Jesus Christ.
              </p>
              <p>The transcendence of God has been rediscovered by science and sociology; theology in the closing decades of the 20th century endeavoured to overcome the purely anthropological interpretation of religion and once more to discover anew its transcendent ground. Theology has consequently been confronted with the problem of Trinity in a new form, which, in view of the Christian experience of God as an experience of the presence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, cannot be eliminated.</p>

                </thumbasm>The starting point for the Christian understanding of what it is to be human is the recognition that humans are created in the image of God. This idea views God and humans joined with one another through a mysterious connection. God is thought of as incomprehensible and beyond substance; yet God desired to reflect the divine image in one set of creatures and chose humans for this. Man as the image of God belongs, therefore, to the self-revelation of God in quite a decisive way. God, being reflected in the human creature, makes this being a partner in the realization of the divine self; there is constant interaction. Humans find fulfillment in God, the divine prototype, but God also first comes to the fulfillment of the divine essence in relation, in this case, with the human.

              <headtitle>The human as a creature</headtitle>
              <p>
                The idea that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> were created according to the image of God was already being interpreted in a twofold direction in the early church. For one thing, humans, like all other creatures of the universe, are the creation of God, and as creatures human beings stand in a relationship of utter dependency on God. They have nothing from themselves but owe everything, even their being, exclusively to the will of the divine Creator; they are joined with all other fellow creatures through a relationship of solidarity. The idea of the solidarity of all creatures was eventually eclipsed by the idea of the special position of humans and their special commission of dominion. The idea of solidarity with all creatures has been expressed and practiced by but few charismatic personalities in the history of Western piety, such as by <xref refid="1770126" ty="1" topicid="216793" tocid="">Francis of Assisi</xref> in his “Canticle of the Sun”: “Praised be Thou, my Lord, with all Thy creatures, especially with our sister sun.”
              </p>
              <p>The second aspect of the idea of the human being as a creature operated very much more emphatically: the superiority of humans over all other creatures. God placed humans in a special relationship to the divine. God created them in the divine image, thereby assigning to humans a special commission vis-à-vis all other creatures.</p>

            <h3 tocid="67490">
              <headtitle>The human as the image of God</headtitle>
              <p>
                Influenced by Plato’s philosophy, Christian theologians identified the image of God in human beings only in their intellectual capability and faculty of perception and not in their body. In his work<e> De Trinitate</e>, Augustine attempted to ascertain traces of divine Trinity in the human intellect. Christian mysticism confronted this <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="172621" tocid="">dualistic</xref> view of humans, interpreting humans in their mind-body entirety as being in the image of God. The image of God is stamped all the way into the sphere of human corporeality. The idea of human creation according to the image of God is already based upon the intention of the Incarnation, the self-representation of God in corporeality. Even according to their somatic (bodily) condition, humans are the universal form of being, in whom the powers and creative principles of the whole universe are combined in a personal unity of spirit, soul, and body.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Christian understanding of evil is also linked with the idea of human creation according to the image of God. Evil cannot, in the Christian view, be derived from the dualistic assumption of the contrasts of spirit and body, reason and matter. According to the Christian understanding, the triumph of evil is not identical with the victory of matter, the “flesh,” over the spirit. Nevertheless, a dualistic interpretation has been advocated, because for many centuries the Christian understanding of sin, even among many of the church’s teachers, was influenced by the philosophical assumptions of Neoplatonic dualism. Moreover, in Augustine there are still the aftereffects of <xref refid="1632738" ty="1" topicid="362167" tocid="">Manichaeism</xref>, which ultimately viewed the main motive force of sin in “concupiscence”—i.e., the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="537179" tocid="">sex drive</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only genuine departure point for the Christian view of evil is the idea of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218436" tocid="">freedom</xref>, which is based in the concept of the human being as the image of God. The human is person because God is person. It is apparent in Christian claims that the concept of the human as “being-as-person” is the real seal of that human as “being-as-the-image-of-God,” and therein lies the true nobility that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. If the Christian faith is differentiated from other religions through the fact that for the Christian God is person, then this faith takes effect in the thereby resulting consequence that the human being, too, is person.
              </p>
              <p>God at the same time entered into a great risk in creating the human as person. The real sign of God as personal being is freedom. When God created humans according to his image, he also gave over to them this mark of nobility—i.e., freedom. This alone constitutes the presupposition of love. Only through this freedom can the human being as partner of God offer free love to God; only in this freedom can God’s love be answered through free love in return. Love in its fulfilled form, according to the Christian understanding, is possible only between persons; conversely, the person can be realized only in the complete love to another person. Humans can use this freedom to offer God, their Creator, their freely given love.</p>
              <p>Yet, in the gift of freedom itself there also lay enclosed the possibility for humans to decide against God and to raise themselves to the goal of divine love. The event that is portrayed in the story of the Fall (Genesis, chapter 3) is essentially the trying out of freedom, the free decision of humans against God. This rebellion consists of the fact that human beings improperly use their God-given freedom to set themselves against God and even to wish to be “like God.”</p>

              <p>
                This special interpretation of sin likewise renders understandable the specifically Christian understanding of human redemption, namely, the view of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> as the historical figure of the Redeemer—i.e., the specifically Christian view of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284611" tocid="">incarnation</xref> of God in Jesus Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Christian understanding of the incarnation is based upon an idea that is found in the simple saying of The Gospel According to John: “The Word became flesh” (chapter 1, verse 14). In Christianity, it is not a transcendent, divine being that takes on the appearance of an earthly corporeality, so as to be manifested through this semblance of a body; instead, God himself as human, as member of a definite people, a definite family, at a certain time—“suffered under <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="460341" tocid="">Pontius Pilate</xref>”—enters into the corporeality, carnality, and materiality of the history of mankind. In the midst of history God creates the beginning of a thorough transformation of humans that in like manner embraces all spheres of human being—matter, soul, and mind. Incarnation so constituted did not have the character of veiling God in a human form, which would enable the divine being to reveal a new teaching with human words. The incarnation is not the special instance of a cyclic descent of God always occurring afresh in constantly new veils. Instead, it is the unique intervention of God in the history of the human world. Therein God took the figure of a single historical person into the divine being, suffered through the historical conditions of being, and overcame in this person, Jesus Christ, the root of human corruption—the misuse of freedom. God thereby established the dawn of a transformed, renewed, exalted form of human being and opened a realm in which love to God and to neighbour can be tranquilly fulfilled.

              <headtitle>The problem of suffering</headtitle>
              <p>
                The starting point for the Christian understanding of suffering is the messianic self-understanding of Jesus himself. A temptation to power and self-exaltation lay in the late Jewish promise of the coming of the Messiah–Son of man. The Gospel According to Matthew described the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the wilderness as a temptation to worldly power. Jesus himself deeply disappointed his disciples’ notions aiming at power and exaltation, in that he taught them, in accordance with Isaiah, chapter 53: “The Son of man will suffer many things.” In Jesus’ announcements of suffering the Christian understanding of suffering is clearly expressed: suffering is not the final aim and end in itself in the realization of human destiny; it is the gateway to resurrection, to rebirth, to new creation. This idea receives its clarification from the Christian understanding of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="545534" tocid="">sin</xref>. Sin as the misuse of human freedom has led humans into total opposition against God. Turning to God can therefore take place only when the results of this rebellion are overcome in all levels of human being, all the way to physical corporeality.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early church the sign of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="144028" tocid="">cross</xref> was not considered a glorification of suffering but a “sign of victory” (<e>tropaion</e>) in the sense of the ancient triumphal sign that was set up at the place where the victorious turning point of the battle took place. The cross was likewise considered the “dread of the demons,” since as a victory sign it struck terror into the hitherto ruling demonic powers of the world. An ancient church hymn of the cross spoke of the “cross of the beauty of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>.” The emperor Constantine, following his vision of a cross in the heavens, fastened to the standards of the imperial legions the cross, which was considered the victory sign for the community of Christians hitherto persecuted by the Roman Empire, and elevated it to a token of military triumph over the legions of his pagan foes that were assembled under the sign of the old gods.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Christian understanding, suffering also does not appear—as in <xref refid="1770143" ty="1" topicid="83184" tocid="">Buddhism</xref>—as suffering simply under the general conditions of human existence in this world; it is instead coupled with the specifically Christian idea of the imitation of Christ. Individual Christians are called to follow the example of Christ; incorporation into the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">body of Christ</xref> is granted to those who are ready to carry out within themselves Christ’s destiny of suffering, death, and resurrection. The early church’s characterization of the Christian was that of <e>Christophoros</e>—“bearer of Christ.” Suffering was an unalterable principle in the great drama of freedom, which was identical with the drama of redemption.

              <p>
                Just as clear is the significance that lies in the Christian understanding of the resurrection. A dualistic understanding of what it is to be human, which assumes an essential difference between the spiritual and the material-bodily sides of human existence, necessarily leads to the idea of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283613" tocid="">immortality</xref> of the soul. The Christian hope, however, does not aim at the immortality of the soul but at the resurrection of the body. Corporeality is not a quality that is foreign to the spiritual. Everything spiritual presses toward corporealization; its eternal figure is a corporeal figure. This hope was expressed by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="553647" tocid="">Vladimir Solovyov</xref>:<qt>
                  <qtpara>What help would the highest and greatest moral victory be for man, if the enemy, “death,” which lurks in the ultimate depth of man’s physical, somatic, material sphere, were not overcome?</qtpara>
                </qt>
              </p>
              <p>The goal of redemption is not separation of the spirit from the body; it is rather the new human in the entirety of body, soul, and mind. It is appropriate to say that Christianity has contended for a “holistic” view of the human. The Christian image of the human being has an essentially corporeal aspect that is based in the idea of the incarnation and finds its most palpable expression in the idea of the resurrection.</p>

            <h3 tocid="67494">
              <headtitle>Progressive human perfection</headtitle>
              <p>For a long time Christian anthropology maintained that the human was a complete being, placed in a finished world like a methodically provided-for tenant in a prefabricated, newly built residence ready for occupation. Redemption was understood just as statically: salvation appeared in the teachings of church dogma as restitution and restoration of the lost divine image and often in fact more a patching up of fragments through ecclesiastical remedies than as a real new creation.</p>
              <p>Although their view is not uncontroversial, some theologians have found in the New Testament a progression of salvation in history. Indeed, there is a progress of both the individual human being and of mankind as a whole, what might be thought of under some terms and conditions as a potential for the progressive perfection of the human being. This characteristic stands out in the proclamation of Jesus when he promises his disciples: “Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.” (Matthew 13:43). In The Gospel According to John, Jesus promises his disciples an increase of their divine powers that is to exceed even the spiritual powers at work in himself (John 14:12). Similar expectations are also expressed in the First Letter of John: “Beloved…it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” (3:2).</p>
              <p>
                The idea of the Christian “superman,” which was expressed by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="390572" tocid="">Montanus</xref>, is a result of this view. In connection with the breakthrough of the idea of evolution through Darwin in the areas of biology, zoology, and anthropology, the tendency asserted itself—above all in 19th-century American theology—of interpreting the Christian history of salvation in terms of the evolution and expectation of future human perfection in the form of reaching even higher charismatic levels and ever higher means of spiritual knowledge and communication.

              <headtitle>The “new man”: The human being in the light of Christ</headtitle>
              <p>Probably no idea and no sentiment in the early church dominated the Christian feeling for life so thoroughly and comprehensively as the consciousness of the newness of the life into which persons viewed themselves transposed through participation in the life and body of Christ. The newness of the Christian message of salvation not only filled the hearts of the faithful but was also striking to the non-Christian milieu. The new humans experience the newness of life as the life of Christ that is beginning to mature in themselves, as the overwhelming experience of a new state already now commencing. In the New Testament statements about the new man, it was not a settled, complete new condition that was being spoken of, into which people are transposed through grace, but rather the beginning of a coming new state, the consummation of which will first take place in the future. The new human is one who is engaged in the process of renewal; new life is a principle of growth of the Christian maturing toward “perfect manhood in Christ.” The new situation of human beings, for their part, works anew as fermenting “leaven” within old humankind, as “fresh dough,” and contributes to transforming the old form of humanity through its fermentation into the state of the Kingdom of God.</p>

              <headtitle>The “reborn human”</headtitle>
              <p>“Rebirth” has often been identified with a definite, temporally datable form of “conversion,” especially in the pietistic and revival type of Christianity. In the history of Christian piety a line of prominent personalities, most notably Paul and Augustine, experienced their rebirth in the form of a temporally datable and also locally ascertainable conversion event. There is no single type of experience, however, that completes the mysterious event characterized with the expression rebirth. The mode of experience of rebirth itself is as manifold as the individuality of the person concerned. The different forms of rebirth experience are distinguished not only according to whether the event sets in suddenly with overwhelming surprise, as when one is “born again” or “sees the light,” or as the result of a slow process, a “growing,” a “maturing,” and an “evolution.” They are also distinguished according to the psychic capability predominant at the time that thereby takes charge (will, intellect), the endowment at hand, and the personal type of religious experience. With the voluntaristic type, rebirth is expressed in a new alignment of the will, in the liberation of new capabilities and powers that were hitherto undeveloped in the person concerned. With the intellectual type, it leads to an activation of the capabilities for understanding, to the breakthrough of a “vision.” With others it leads to the discovery of an unexpected beauty in the order of nature or to the discovery of the mysterious meaning of history. With still others it leads to a new vision of the moral life and its orders, to a selfless realization of love of neighbour. In the experience of Christian rebirth, the hitherto existing old condition of humanity is not simply eliminated so far as the given personality structure is concerned—a structure dependent upon heredity, education, and earlier life experiences. Instead, each person affected perceives his life in Christ at any given time as “newness of life.”</p>

              <headtitle>Human liberation</headtitle>
              <p>The condition of “fallen” humanity is frequently characterized in the New Testament as “slavery.” It is the slavery of human willfulness that wants to have and enjoy all things for itself: the slavery of alienated love, which is no longer turned toward God but toward one’s own self and the things of this world and which also degrades one’s fellows into the means for egoism and exploitation. The servitude of people fallen away from God is much more oppressive than mere slavery of the senses and of greed for life. It is the enslavement not only of their “flesh” but also of all levels of their being, even the “most spiritual.”</p>

                In his commentary on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508652" tocid="">Letter of Paul to the Romans</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Luther</xref> observed: “The entire man who is not reborn is flesh, even in his spirit; the entire man who is reborn is spirit, even when he eats and sleeps.” Only from this perspective do Martin Luther’s words about the “Freedom of a Christian Man”— the title of a work written in 1520—receive their true meaning. The freedom that Christians receive is the freedom that Christ, spoken of by Paul as the new Adam, gained for them. The freedom of Christians is the freedom reattained in Christ, in which the possibility of the misuse of freedom is addressed and overcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early centuries of the church special significance fell to the evangelical schema of liberation—and to the corresponding schema of ransom—in a society that, in its social structure, was constructed entirely upon the system of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="548305" tocid="">slavery</xref>. On the one hand, wide strata of the population lived in the permanent state of slavery; on the other hand, on the basis of the prevailing usage of war, even the free population could face the danger of passing into possession of the victor as a slave in case of a conquest. The schema of liberation could therefore count upon a spontaneous understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Freedom alone also makes a perfect community possible. Such a community embraces God and the neighbour, in whom the image of God confronts human beings in the flesh. Community is fulfilled in the free service of love. Luther articulated the paradox of Christian freedom, which includes both love and service: “A Christian man is a free lord of all things and subordinate to no one. A Christian man is a submissive servant of all things and subject to everyone.” Christian freedom is thus to be understood neither purely individually nor purely collectively. The motives of the personal and the social are indivisibly joined by the idea that each person is an image of God for himself alone, but in Christ he also recognizes the image of God in the neighbour and with the neighbour is a member in the one body of Christ. Here the evolutive principle of the idea of freedom is not to be mistaken; in it, for example, lay the spiritual impetus to the social and racial emancipation of slaves, as it was demanded by the great Christian champions of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275840" tocid="">human rights</xref> in the 18th and 19th centuries and, through great efforts, pursued and achieved.

Joy was the basic mood of congregational gatherings and was often expressed in an exuberant jubilation. It had its origin in the recognition that the dominion of evil had been broken through the power of Christ; that death, devil, and demons no longer possessed any claim upon believers; and that the forces of forgiveness, reconciliation, resurrection, and transfiguration were effective in humankind. This principle of the joy of the Christian is most strongly alive in the liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The view of the gifts of the Spirit stands in a direct relationship with the understanding of the human as the image of God. For the believing Christian of the original period of the church, the Holy Spirit was the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is already now made manifest in his body, the community of the faithful, as the miraculous principle of life of the new eon. Throughout the centuries the Holy Spirit has remained the ferment of church history—all great reformations and the founding of new churches and sects have occurred as the result of new charismatic breakthroughs.</p>

              <headtitle>Christian perfection</headtitle>
              <p>The demand for perfection is frequently repeated in the New Testament and has played a significant role in the history of the faith. In The Gospel According to Matthew, Jesus says to his disciples: “You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (5:48). Although this demand may exceed the measure of reasonableness for humans, it is meant literally and is repeated in other parts of the New Testament. The meaning of this claim is recognizable only from the understanding of the human as the image of God and from the apprehension of Christ as the “new Adam.” The perfection of believers is the perfection with which they reflect the image of God. This image has been disfigured through willful alienation from the original, but in Christ believers can recover the perfection of the image of God.</p>
              <p>The idea of the deification of man, which captures the Greek notion of “partaking” of the divine character, also points in the direction of perfection. Post-Reformation theology, out of anxiety about “mysticism,” struck this concept almost entirely from its vocabulary. In the first one and a half millennia of the Christian church, however, the idea of deification—of partaking in God’s being—was a central concept of Christian anthropology. Athanasius created the fundamental formula for the theology of deification: “God became man in order that we become God.” In the teachings of the early church these words became the basis of theological anthropology. Only the idea of perfection makes understandable a final enhancement of the Christian image of the human—the intensification from “child of God” to “friend of God.” This appears as the highest form of communion reached between God and human beings.</p>

              <p>
                For the Christian, the fellow human is the present Christ himself; in the eye of Christian faith, Christ is present in everyone, even in the most debased, a belief that constitutes the basis of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="391754" tocid="">Christian ethics</xref>. According to Matthew (chapter 25, verses 40 and 45), the Judge of the world says to the redeemed: “Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me,” and to the damned: “As you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.” Tertullian cites another saying of the Lord: “If you have seen your brother, you have seen your Lord.” In other humans, Christians see, under the wrapping of misery, degeneration, and suffering, the image of the present Lord, who became human, who suffered, died, and was resurrected in order to lead all humanity back into the Kingdom of God.
              </p>
              <p>In the self-understanding of the Christian community two tendencies have battled with one another from the beginning of church history. They lead to completely different consequences in the basic orientation of Christians toward fellow Christians and fellow human beings.</p>
              <p>
                One attitude concerns the governing idea of election. God chooses some out of the human race, which exists in opposition to all that is divine, and includes the elect in his Kingdom. This idea underlines the aristocratic character of the Kingdom of God; it consists of an elite of elect. In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="500324" tocid="">Revelation to John</xref>, the 144,000 “…who have not defiled themselves with women” (Revelation 14:4) constituted those chosen for entry into the Kingdom of God. For Augustine and his theological successors up to Calvin, the community of the elect is numerically restricted; their number corresponds to the number of fallen angels, who must be replaced through the matching number of redeemed men and women so that the Kingdom of God would be restored numerically. The church is here understood as a selection of a few out of the masses of perdition who constitute the jetsam of the history of salvation. This orientation, it has been argued, conceals a grave endangering of the consciousness of community, for self-righteousness, which is the root of self-love and thereby the death of love of neighbour, easily enters as a result of the consciousness of exclusive election.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other attitude proceeds from the opposite idea that the goal of the salvation inaugurated through Jesus Christ is the redemption of all humanity. According to this view, God’s love of humans (<e>philanthrōpia</e>), as the drama of divine self-surrender for human salvation shows, is greater than the righteousness that craves the eternal damnation of the guilty. Since the time of Origen, this second attitude has been found not only among the great mystics of the Eastern Church but among some mystics of Western Christianity. The teaching of universal reconciliation (<e>apokatastasis pantōn</e>) has struck against opposition in all Christian confessions. This is connected with the fact that such a universalistic view easily leads to a disposition that regards redemption as a kind of natural process that no one can evade. Such an orientation can lead to a weakening or loss of a consciousness of moral responsibility before God and neighbour; it contains the temptation to spiritual security and moral indolence.

            </p>
            <p>
              In Christianity the concept of the church received a new meaning through its relationship to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> as the messianic inaugurator of the Kingdom of God: (1) with Christ the elected community of the end time has appeared; (2) the church is the eschatological gift of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref>, which already flows through the life of the church (Acts 2:33); (3) the community of the end time consists of those who believe in Jesus Christ—the idea of the elected covenant people (i.e., the Jews) is transferred to the “new Israel”; (4) the church forms the body of its Lord; and (5) the church consists of “living stones,” from which its house is “built” (1 Peter 2:5).
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus himself created no firm organization for his community; the expectation of the immediate imminence of the Kingdom of God provided no occasion for this. Nevertheless, the selection of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30208" tocid="">Apostles</xref> and the special position of individual Apostles within this circle pointed to the beginnings of a structuralization of his community.

            </p>
            <p>
              The unity of the church, which was dispersed geographically, was understood from the viewpoint of the <xref refid="1633076" ty="1" topicid="161756" tocid="">Diaspora</xref> (the dispersion of the Jews outside Palestine after the Babylonian Captivity).

The earthly church is thus the representative of the heavenly church.

              <p>
                Establishment of norms for the church was necessary because diverse interpretations of the Christian message were conceived under the influence of the religions of late antiquity, especially <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236343" tocid="">Gnosticism</xref>—a syncretistic religious dualistic belief system that incorporated Christian motifs. In Gnostic interpretations, mixed Christian and pagan ideas appealed to divine inspiration or claimed to be revelations of Christ. The church erected three defenses against the prophetic and visionary efficacy of pneumatic (spiritual) figures as well as against pagan syncretism: (1) the New Testament canon, (2) the apostolic “rules of faith,” or “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142374" tocid="">creeds</xref>,” and (3) the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30289" tocid="">apostolic succession</xref> of bishops. The common basis of these three defenses is the idea of “apostolicity.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The early church never forgot that it had created and fixed the canon of the New Testament, primarily in response to the threat of Gnostic writings. This is one of the primary distinctions between the Orthodox Church and the Reformation churches, which view the Scriptures as the final norm and rule for the church and church teaching. The Orthodox Church, like the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref>, teaches that the Christian Church existed prior to the formation of the canon of Scripture—that it is indeed the source and origin of the Scripture itself. Thus, tradition plays a significant role alongside the Holy Scriptures in the Orthodox and Roman churches.
              </p>
              <p>The apostolic rule of faith—i.e., the creed—issued from the apostolic tradition of the church as a second, shorter form of its solidification, at first oral and then written. It also served as a defense against Gnosticism and syncretistic heretical interpretations of the Christian faith.</p>
              <p>
                The third defense that the church used against the Gnostics and syncretistic and charismatic movements within the church was the office of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="66863" tocid="">bishop</xref>, which became legitimized through the concept of <xref refid="1633096" ty="1" topicid="30289" tocid="">apostolic succession</xref>. The mandate for missions, the defense against prophecy, the polemics with Gnosticism and other alternative versions of Christianity, the persecution of the church, and, not least of all, management of church discipline allowed the monarchical episcopacy to emerge in the early centuries. The bishop, as leader of the eucharistic worship service, as teacher, and as curer of souls, became the chief shepherd of the church and was considered its representative.

Just as all Apostles without exception were of equal authority and none of them held a paramount position over against the others, so too their successors, the bishops, are of equal authority without exception.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the politics of the Eastern Orthodox churches have a decidedly <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578481" tocid="">synodal</xref> character.

Not only the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="475922" tocid="">priesthood</xref> but also the laity have been able to participate in Orthodox synods. Election to ecclesiastical offices (i.e., pastor, bishop, or patriarch) involves participation by both clergy and laity.

                Orthodoxy was divided into various old and new types of churches. Some of these were “patriarchal,” which meant that they were directly responsible to a patriarch. Others were “autocephalous” (Greek: <e>autokephalos</e>, “self-headed”), which has come to mean in the modern world that as national churches they are in communion with Constantinople but are responsible for authority to their own national synods. This division, and the fact that Orthodoxy has so often been the victim of revolutionary change and political onslaught, have served as a hindrance against any new ecumenical council, even though many Orthodox have asked for one.

              <p>Christianity, from its beginning, tended toward an intolerance that was rooted in the understanding of itself as revelation of the divine truth that became human in Jesus Christ himself. “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me” (John 14:6). To be a Christian is to “follow the truth” (3 John); the Christian proclamation is “the way of truth” (2 Peter 2:2). Those who do not acknowledge the truth are enemies “of the cross of Christ” (Philippians 3:18) who have “exchanged the truth about God for a lie” (Romans 1:25) and made themselves the advocates and confederates of the “adversary, the devil,” who “prowls around like a roaring lion” (1 Peter 5:8). Thus, one cannot make a deal with the devil and his party—and in this lies the basis for intolerance in Christianity.</p>
              <p>
                Christianity developed an intolerant attitude toward Judaism early in its history, especially after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in <e ty="s">ad</e> 70. This intolerance was rooted in the competition for religious converts and for possession of the Hebrew Scripture and its legacy. In order to proclaim itself as the “new Israel,” Christianity had to repudiate the claims of Israel’s traditional children. From the time of the composition of the Gospels, therefore, Jews were identified as the killers of Christ, and subsequent Christian theologians developed an elaborate picture of the Jews as the enemy of the faith, though some argued that the Jews must survive until the end of time as witness to the truth of Christian revelation. Such hostile and irrational views laid the foundation for centuries of <xref refid="1633133" ty="1" topicid="27646" tocid="">anti-Semitism</xref> among Christians.

                Early Christianity, especially following the conversion of the emperor Constantine, aimed at the elimination of paganism—the destruction of its institutions, temples, tradition, and the order of life based upon it. After Christianity’s victory over Greco-Roman religions, it left only the ruins of paganism still remaining. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="385426" tocid="">Christian missions</xref> of later centuries constantly aimed at the destruction of indigenous religions, including their cultic places and traditions (as in missions to the Anglo-Saxons, Germans, and Slavs). This objective was not realized in mission areas in which Christian political powers did not succeed in conquests—e.g., China and Japan; but in Indian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236436" tocid="">Goa</xref>, for example, the temples and customs of all indigenous religions were eliminated by the Portuguese conquerors.

                The attitude of intolerance was further reinforced when <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295765" tocid="">Islam</xref> confronted Christianity from the 7th century on. Islam understood itself as the conclusion and fulfillment of the Old and New Testament revelation. Christianity, however, understood Islam either as a new heresy (<xref refid="1633136" ty="1" topicid="396226" tocid="">Muhammad</xref>, it was believed, was taught by a heretical or apostate monk) or eschatologically as the religion of the “false prophets” or of the <xref refid="1633135" ty="1" topicid="27850" tocid="">Antichrist</xref>. The aggression of Christianity against Islam—on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="280587" tocid="">Iberian Peninsula</xref>, in Palestine, and in the entire eastern Mediterranean area during the <xref refid="1633140" ty="1" topicid="144695" tocid="">Crusades</xref>—was carried out under this fundamental attitude of intolerance. Intolerance of indigenous religions was also manifested in Roman Catholic missions in the New World; in the Western Hemisphere, these missions resulted in the wholesale destruction of Native American cults and cultic places.

                When the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> churches asserted the exclusive claim of possessing the Christian truth, they tried to carry it out with the help of the political and military power at their disposal. In the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, Christian intolerance developed into an internal fratricidal struggle in which each side sought to annihilate the other party in the name of truth. The fact that such attempts did not succeed led to new reflections upon the justification of claims to exclusive possession of absolute truth.

                The intolerance of the Reformation territorial churches found its counterpart in the intolerance of the revolutionary groups of the Reformation period, such as that of the German radical Reformer <xref refid="1633143" ty="1" topicid="397713" tocid="">Thomas Müntzer</xref>, which wanted to force the coming of the Kingdom of God through the dominion of the “elect” over the “godless.” In the intolerance of the ideology and techniques of many modern political revolutions and authoritarian regimes some see either a legacy or a mimicking of old Christian patterns and methods.
              </p>
              <p>Although calls for tolerance had been made earlier in church history, among the first to speak up consistently for tolerance were the Baptists and Spiritualists of the Reformation period. Their defense of tolerance contributed especially to the recognition of the evident contradiction between the theological self-conception of Christianity as a religion of love of God and neighbour and the inhumanity practiced by the churches in the persecution of dissenters. This recognition even provoked criticism of the Christian truths of faith themselves.</p>
              <p>
                The Roman Catholic Church in the past has consistently opposed the development of religious toleration and as late as the 20th century in some countries ensured that legal restrictions against Protestant minorities were established. With <xref refid="1633144" ty="1" topicid="304923" tocid="">Pope John XXIII</xref> and the <xref refid="1633145" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Second Vatican Council</xref> (1962–65), however, the church adopted a much more accommodating stance, which has been appropriate both to the ecumenical situation of Christendom since the late 20th century and to the personal character of the Christian faith.

              <headtitle>Organization</headtitle>
              <p>In the early church, discipline concerned four areas in which there arose violations of the demand for holiness: (1) the relationship to the pagan social milieu and the forms of life and culture connected with it (e.g., idolatry, the emperor’s cult, the theatre, and the circus); (2) the relationship of the sexes within the Christian community (e.g., rejection of polygamy, prostitution, pederasty, sodomy, and obscene literature and art); (3) other offenses against the community, especially murder and property crimes of all kinds; and (4) the relationship to teachers of false doctrine, false prophets, and heretics.</p>
              <p>
                Employment of church discipline at an early date led at first to the simple distinction between “mortal” and “not mortal” sins (1 John 5:15 ff.)—i.e., between sins that through their gravity resulted in loss of eternal life and those that did not. In earliest Christianity, the relapse of a baptized Christian into paganism (i.e., <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30205" tocid="">apostasy</xref>) was believed to be the most serious offense. In the <xref refid="1633153" ty="1" topicid="259114" tocid="">Letter to the Hebrews</xref> one who is baptized irrevocably forfeits salvation through a relapse into grievous sin. The difficulties in substantiating the theory and practice of a second repentance were solved by Pope <xref refid="1633152" ty="1" topicid="89764" tocid="">Calixtus</xref> (reigned 217?–222). This question was especially important in Rome because of the great number of offenses against the idea of holiness. Calixtus granted bishops the right to decide about definitive exclusion from the congregation or readmission as well as the right to evaluate church punishments. Although it did not occur without fierce opposition (e.g., Montanism), the concentration of penitential discipline in the bishops’ hands probably contributed more to the strengthening of episcopal power and to the achievement of the monarchical episcopate in the church than any other single factor.
              </p>
              <p>Attainment of the church’s demand of holiness was made more difficult in the large cities, especially in reference to sexual purity. The period of persecution by the emperors and the demand that subjects of the empire sacrifice before the altars of the emperor’s images brought countless new instances of apostasy. The so-called Lapsi (Lapsedones), who had performed sacrifices before the emperor’s image but, after persecution, moved back into the churches again, became a serious problem for the church, sometimes causing schisms (e.g., the Donatists).</p>
              <p>
                The execution of church discipline by the clergy was subordinated to the regulations of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="92870" tocid="">canon law</xref> provided for priests. A genuine practice of church discipline was maintained in the monasteries in connection with the public confession of guilt, which was made by every monk before the entire assembly in the weekly gatherings of the chapter. A strong revival of church discipline among the laity also resulted from the church discipline pursued within monasticism.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the whole, the casuistic regulation of church discipline led to its externalization and devaluation. The medieval sects, therefore, always stressed in their critique of the worldly church the lack of spiritual discipline and endeavoured to realize a voluntary church discipline in terms of a renewed radical demand of holiness based on early Christianity. The radical sects that emerged in the Reformation reproached the territorial churches by claiming that they had restricted themselves to a renovation of doctrine and not to a renewal of the Christian life and a restoration of the “communion of saints.” Different groups of <xref refid="1633154" ty="1" topicid="22160" tocid="">Anabaptists</xref> (e.g., Swiss Brethren, Mennonites, and Hutterites), especially, attempted to realize the ideal of the purity and holiness of the church through the reintroduction of a strict church discipline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495584" tocid="">Reformed churches</xref> in particular endeavoured to make church discipline a valid concern of the community. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="229000" tocid="">Geneva</xref>, church discipline was expressed, at the instigation of Calvin, in the establishment of special overseers, who were assigned to watch over the moral behaviour of church members. Calvin’s reforms in Geneva also led to the creation of such social arrangements as ecclesiastically controlled inns and taverns, in which not only the consumption of food and drink but even the topics of conversation were subject to stern regulation. The cooperation of ecclesiastical discipline and state legislation found its characteristic expression in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref> in the <xref refid="1633155" ty="1" topicid="478408" tocid="">Prohibition</xref> amendment to the Constitution. Its introduction came most strongly from congregational churches, above all those characterized by Evangelical, Fundamentalist, or Pentecostal outlooks. They united forces with more moderate or liberal churches that were experienced in trying to affect the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social order</xref> through legislation. Together they battled against the misuse of alcohol as part of their ideal to extend Christian norms and influence to the whole of society.
              </p>
              <p>In the early 21st century, church discipline, in the original spiritual sense of voluntary self-control, is practiced only in smaller communities of evangelical Christians, in which the ideal of holiness of the community is still maintained and in which the mutual, personal bond of the congregational members in the spirit of Christian fellowship still allows a meaningful realization of a church discipline. It is also practiced in churches in developing nations where the practice of church discipline still appears as a vitally necessary centre of the credible self-representation of the Christian community. Characteristically, therefore, these churches’ main criticism of the old institutional churches has been directed against the cessation of church discipline among their members.</p>

              <p>
                The Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches are organized around the office of the bishop. As the development of the episcopacy has been covered above (under <xref refid="1759054" ty="3" topicid="115240" tocid="67505">Evolution of the episcopal office</xref>), this section will examine the organization of the Reformation churches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Occupying a special position among these churches is the episcopal polity of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1310018" tocid="">Anglican Communion</xref>. Despite the embittered opposition of <xref refid="1633193" ty="1" topicid="484034" tocid="">Puritan</xref> and independent groups in England during the 16th and 17th centuries, this polity has maintained the theory and practice of the episcopal office of apostolic succession. The Low Church tradition of the Anglican Communion views the episcopal office as a form of ecclesiastical polity that has been tested through the centuries and is therefore commendable for pragmatic reasons; the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="80491" tocid="">Broad Church</xref> tradition, however, emphatically adheres to the traditional worth of the episcopal office without allowing the faithful to be excessively dependent upon its acknowledgement. The High Church tradition, on the other hand, values episcopal polity as an essential element of the Christian Church that belongs to the church’s statements of faith. The episcopal branch of the Methodist Church has also retained the bishop’s office in the sense of the Low Church and Broad Church view.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> churches an episcopal tradition has been maintained in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="576637" tocid="">Swedish</xref> state church (Lutheran), whose Reformation was introduced through a resolution of the imperial Diet of Västerås in 1527, with the cooperation of the Swedish bishops. In the German Evangelical (Lutheran and Reformed) territories, the bishops’ line of apostolic succession was ruptured by the Reformation. As imperial princes, the Roman Catholic German bishops of the 16th century were rulers of their territories; they did not join the Reformation in order to avoid renouncing the exercise of their sovereign (temporal) rights as demanded by Luther’s Reformation. On the basis of a legal construction originally intended as a right of emergency, the Evangelical rulers functioned as the bishops of their territorial churches but only in questions concerning external church order. This development was promoted through the older conception of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="166626" tocid="">divine right of kings</xref> and princes, which was especially operative in Germanic lands.
              </p>
              <p>
                In matters of church polity, controversial tendencies that began in the Reformation remained as divisive forces within the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178836" tocid="">ecumenical movement</xref> in the 20th century. For Luther and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheranism</xref>, the polity of the church has no divine–legal characteristics; it is of subordinate significance for the essence of the church, falls under human ordinances, and is therefore alterable. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="90293" tocid="">Calvinism</xref>, on the other hand (e.g., in the <e>Ecclesiastical Ordinances</e> of 1541 and in Calvin’s <e>

                </e> [1536]), the Holy Scriptures appear as a codex from which the polity of the congregation can be inferred or derived as a divine law. Thus, on the basis of its spiritual–legal character, church polity would be a component of the essence of the church itself. Both tendencies stand in a constant inner tension with one another in the main branches of the Reformation and within the individual confessions as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even in Lutheranism, however, there has been a demand for a stronger emphasis upon the independent episcopal character of the superintendent’s or president’s office. Paradoxically, in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran Church</xref>, which came forth with the demand of the universal priesthood of believers, there arose the development of ecclesiastical authorities but not the development of self-contained congregational polities. When a merger of three Lutheran bodies produced a new <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196846" tocid="">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</xref> in 1988, it established the bishop as leader of the synodal jurisdictions. In Lutheranism these bishops replaced presidents. Bishops were regarded there, as in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378415" tocid="">Methodism</xref>, as part of the well-being—but not the being or essence—of the church. Reformed churches developed more or less self-contained congregational polities because the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495584" tocid="">Reformed church</xref> congregation granted greater participation in the life of the congregation to the laity as presbyters and elders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Presbyterian polity appeals to the model of the original church. The polity of the Scottish Presbyterian Church and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="475062" tocid="">Presbyterian churches</xref> of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">North America</xref> is primarily based upon this appeal, which was also found among many English Puritan groups and other spiritual descendants of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="90247" tocid="">John Calvin</xref>. It proceeds from the basic view that the absolute power of Christ in his church postulates the equality of rights of all members and can find expression only in a single office, that of the presbyter. Holders of this office are elected by church members, formally analogous to the democratic, republican political mode, and, accordingly, in contrast with the monarchy of the papal and the aristocracy of the episcopal church polity. In Presbyterian churches the differences between clergy and laity have been abolished in theory and, to a great extent, in practice. A superstructure of consistories and presbyteries is superposed one upon the other, with increasing disciplinary power and graduated possibilities of appeal. Through their emphases upon the divine–legal character of Presbyterian polity, the Presbyterian churches have represented a Protestant polity that counters the Roman Catholic concept of the church in the area of ecclesiastical polity. In ecumenical discussions in the 20th century, the divine–legal character of this polity is occasionally noticeable in its thesis of an apostolic succession of presbyters as a counter-thesis to that of the apostolic succession of bishops.

                </thumbasm>The basic concepts of Congregationalism are: the understanding of the congregation as the “holy people” under Jesus Christ; the spiritual priesthood, kingship, and prophethood of every believer and the exchange of spiritual experiences between them, as well as the introduction of a strict church discipline exercised by the congregation itself; the equal rank of all clergy; the freedom of proclamation of the gospel from every episcopal or official permission; and performance of the sacraments according to the institution of Jesus. By virtue of the freedom of self-determination fundamentally granted every congregation, no dogmatic or constitutional union but rather only county union of the Congregationalist churches developed in England. North America, however, became the classic land of Congregationalism as a result of the great Puritan immigration to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="411409" tocid="">New England</xref>, beginning with the Pilgrims on the <e>Mayflower</e> (1620).

              <p>
                Numerous other forms of congregational polity have arisen in the history of Christendom, such as the association idea in the <xref refid="1633197" ty="1" topicid="220221" tocid="">Society of Friends</xref>. Even <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450414" tocid="">Pentecostal</xref> communities have not been able to maintain themselves in a state of unrestrained and constant charismatic impulses but instead have had to develop a legally regulated polity. This was what happened in the early church, which likewise was compelled to restrain the freedom of charisma in a system of rulers and laws. Pentecostal communities either have been constituted in the area of a biblical fundamentalism theologically and on the basis of a congregationalist church polity constitutionally or they have ritualized the outpouring of the Spirit itself. Thus, the characteristic dialectic of the Holy Spirit is confirmed: the Spirit creates law and the Spirit breaks law even in the most recent manifestations of its working.

              <p>
                The central focus of the liturgy of the early church was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Eucharist</xref>, which was interpreted as a fellowship meal with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499816" tocid="">resurrected</xref> Christ. Most expressions of Judaism at the time of Christ were dominated by an intense expectation, appropriated by the early Christian church, of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>, which would be inaugurated by the Messiah–Son of man. At the centre of Jesus’ preaching on the Kingdom of God is the promise that the blessed would “eat bread” with the exalted Messiah–Son of man (Luke 13:29). The Lord himself would serve the community of the Kingdom at the messianic meal (Luke 12:37 ff.), which bears the features of a wedding banquet. The basic mood in the community gathered about him is thus one of nuptial joy over the inauguration of the promised end time. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331170" tocid="">supper</xref> that Jesus celebrated with his disciples “on the night when he was betrayed” (1 Corinthians 11:23) inaugurated the heavenly meal that will be continued in the Kingdom of God, as Jesus indicated when he declared “I shall not drink again of this fruit of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629422" tocid="">vine</xref> until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” (Matthew 26:29)
              </p>
              <p>The death of Jesus at first bewildered his community in the face of his promise, but the appearances of the risen Christ confirmed their expectations about the messianic Kingdom. These appearances influenced the expectations about the messianic meal and the continuation of fellowship with the Son of man in the meal. Faith in the Resurrection and an expectation of the continuation of the fellowship meal with the exalted Son of man are two basic elements of the Eucharist that have been a part of the liturgy from the beginnings of the church. In meeting the risen Christ in the eucharistic meal the community sees all the glowing expectations of salvation confirmed.</p>
              <p>
                The Christian community experiences a continuation of the appearances of the Resurrected One in the eucharistic meal. Thus, many liturgical forms developed, all of which served to enhance the meal’s mystery. In the liturgical creations of the 1st to the 6th century, diversity rather than uniformity was a commanding feature of the development of worship forms. This diversity is preserved in the Clementine liturgy (Antioch), the Liturgy of St. James of the church of Jerusalem, the liturgy of St. Mark in Egypt, the Roman mass, and others. The eucharistic mystery developed from a simple form, as depicted in the 2nd-century <e>Didachē</e>, to the fully developed liturgies of the 5th and 6th centuries in both the East and the West.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 6th century two types of liturgies were fixed by canon law in the Eastern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref>: the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (originally the liturgy of Constantinople) and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="55024" tocid="">Liturgy of St. Basil</xref> (originally the liturgy of the Cappadocian monasteries). The Liturgy of St. Basil, however, is celebrated only 10 times during the year, whereas the Liturgy of St. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="116479" tocid="">John Chrysostom</xref> is celebrated most other times. In addition to these liturgies is the so-called <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="474463" tocid="">Liturgy of the Preconsecrated Offerings</xref>, attributed to Pope Gregory I. In this liturgy no consecration of the eucharistic offering occurs—because the eucharistic offerings used have been consecrated on the previous Sunday—and it is celebrated on weekday mornings during Lent as well as from Monday to Wednesday during <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269993" tocid="">Holy Week</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The period of liturgical improvisation apparently was concluded earlier in the Latin West than in the East. The liturgy of the ancient Latin Church is textually available only since the 6th century. Though the Gallic liturgies are essentially closer to the Eastern liturgies, the liturgy of Rome followed a special development. From the middle of the 4th century, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="368145" tocid="">mass</xref> was celebrated in Latin rather than in Greek, which had been the earlier practice.

The Free churches also showed a strong liturgical productivity; in the Herrnhut <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="78942" tocid="">Brethren</xref> (<xref refid="1633228" ty="1" topicid="391899" tocid="">Moravian</xref>) community, <xref refid="1633227" ty="1" topicid="657444" tocid="">Graf von Zinzendorf</xref> ushered in the singing worship services. Methodism, influenced by the spiritual songs and melodies of the Moravian church, also produced new liturgical impulses, especially through its creation of new hymns and songs and its joyousness in singing.

              <p>
                Churches that arose in the 19th and 20th centuries have been especially productive in liturgical reform. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="392525" tocid="">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</xref>, whose members are commonly called <xref refid="1633234" ty="1" topicid="392525" tocid="">Mormons</xref>, developed not only a new type of church song but also a new style of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="344315" tocid="">church music</xref> in the context of their liturgical creation (e.g., “sealing”). The Baptist churches of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="67474" tocid="">African Americans</xref>, whose spirituals are the most impressive sign of a free and spontaneous liturgy, have introduced a charismatic mood in their liturgical innovations. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450414" tocid="">Pentecostal</xref> churches of the 20th century quite consciously attempted to protect themselves against liturgical formalism. The often spontaneously improvised liturgy of the Pentecostal tent missions was transformed into patterns that became familiar to a wider audience through televised evangelism.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though definite and obligatory liturgies have been established as normative, the forms of the liturgy continue to develop and change. The impulse toward variations in worship services was especially noticeable in the latter part of the 20th century. In the Eastern Orthodox liturgy, in the Roman Catholic mass and breviary, and in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="24861" tocid="">Anglican</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran</xref> liturgies, there are both fixed and changing sections. The fixed parts represent the basic structure of the worship service concerned, and the alternating parts emphasize the individual character of a particular service for a certain day or period of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117239" tocid="">church year</xref>. The changing parts consist of special Old and New Testament readings that are appropriate for a particular church festival, as well as of special prayers and particular hymns.
              </p>
              <p>
                The eucharistic liturgy consists of two parts: the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99351" tocid="">Liturgy of the Catechumens</xref> and the Liturgy of the Faithful. This basic structure goes back to a time in which the church was a missionary church that grew for the most part through conversion of adults who were first introduced to the Christian mysteries as catechumens. They received permission to take part in the first part of the worship service (which was instructional) but had to leave the service before the eucharistic mystery was celebrated. The first part of the Orthodox worship service still ends with a threefold exclamation, reminiscent of pre-Christian, Hellenistic mystery formulas: “You catechumens, go forth! None of the catechumens (may remain here)!”
              </p>
              <p>
                The eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church is a kind of mystery drama in which the advent of the Lord is mystically consummated and the entire history of salvation—the Incarnation, death, and Resurrection of Christ the Logos, up to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit—is recapitulated. The Orthodox Church also attaches the greatest value to the fact that the transformation of the elements in bread and wine takes place during the eucharistic mystery. This is not the same as the Roman Catholic dogma of <xref refid="1633236" ty="1" topicid="603196" tocid="">transubstantiation</xref>, which teaches that the substance of the bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ, though the properties of the elements remain the same, when the priest consecrates the bread and wine. According to some Orthodox authorities, the Orthodox view is similar to the Lutheran doctrine of the real presence. The essential and central happening in the Orthodox liturgy, however, is the descent of the resurrected Lord himself, who enters the community as “the King of the universe, borne along invisibly above spears by the angelic hosts.” The transformation of the elements is, therefore, the immediate emanation of this personal presence. Thus, the Orthodox Church does not preserve and display the consecrated host after and outside the eucharistic liturgy, as in the Roman Catholic Church, because the consecrated offerings are mystically apprehended and actualized only during the eucharistic meal.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Roman Catholic mass, the sacrificial character of the Eucharist is strongly emphasized, but it is less so in the Orthodox liturgy because in the Orthodox liturgy the Eucharist is not only a representation of the crucifixion sacrifice (as in the Roman mass) but also of the entire history of salvation, in which the entire congregation, priest and laity, participates. Thus, the Orthodox Church has also held fast to the original form of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Holy Communion</xref> in both kinds and preserves the liturgical gestures of the early church. The Orthodox worshiper prays while standing (because he stands throughout the service), with arms hanging down, crossing himself at the beginning and ending of the prayer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The prayerful gesture of folded hands among Protestant churches derives from an old Germanic tradition of holding the sword hand with the left hand, which symbolizes one’s giving himself over to the protection of God because he is now defenseless. The prayerful gesture of hands pressed flat against one another with the fingertips pointed upward—the symbol of the flame—is practiced among Roman Catholics. Other liturgical gestures found in many Christian churches are crossing oneself, genuflecting, beating oneself on the chest, and kneeling during prayer or when receiving the eucharistic elements. Among some Holiness or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450414" tocid="">Pentecostal churches</xref> spontaneous handclapping and rhythmic movements of the body have been stylized gestures in the worship services. These gestures are often familiar features of worship in churches in Africa, Asia, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331694" tocid="">Latin America</xref>. Liturgical dancing, widely spread in pagan cults, was not practiced in the early church, but in the latter part of the 20th century, liturgical dances were reintroduced in some churches in a limited fashion. Among the many other gestures of devotion and veneration practiced in the liturgically oriented churches such as the Roman Catholic Church, the High Church Anglican churches, and the Orthodox Church, are kissing the altar, the Gospel, the cross, and the holy icons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Liturgical vestments have developed in a variety of fashions, some of which have become very ornate. The liturgical vestments all have symbolic meaning (see <xref refid="19558" ty="3" topicid="117239" tocid="67674">church year: liturgical colours</xref>). In the Orthodox Church the liturgical vestments symbolize the wedding garments that enable the liturgists to share in the heavenly wedding feast, the Eucharist. The <e>epitrachēlion</e>, which is worn around the neck and corresponds to the Roman stole, represents the flowing downward of the Holy Spirit (<e>see</e> <xref refid="1770371" ty="1" topicid="497306" tocid="">religious dress</xref>).

            <p>
              Christianity has exhibited a characteristic tension toward tradition from its very beginnings. This tension, which is grounded in its essence, has been continued throughout its entire history. It began with rejecting the pious traditions of piety of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307197" tocid="">Hebrew</xref> Scriptures and synagogue practices. In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="535714" tocid="">Sermon on the Mount</xref>, Jesus set forth his message as a renunciation of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> tradition of the Law. Yet he created a new tradition, a “new law,” that has been carried on in the church. The dogmatic controversies of the Reformation period give the impression that the tradition of the church has to do primarily, if not exclusively, with ecclesiastical doctrinal tradition. Tradition, however, includes all areas of life of the Christian community and its piety, not just the teachings but also the forms of worship service, bodily gestures of prayer and the liturgy, oral and written tradition and the characteristic process of transition of the oral into written tradition, a new church tradition of rules for eating and fasting, and other aspects of the Christian life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The break with the tradition of Judaism was not total. The Scriptures were adopted from Jewish tradition, but their interpretation was based upon the concepts of salvation that emerged around the figure of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. The book of Psalms, including its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="213672" tocid="">musical form</xref>, was taken over in Christian worship as the foundation of the liturgy. The new revelation became tradition in the oral transmission of the words of the Lord (the logia) and the reports (kerygma) concerning the events of his life that were important for the early church’s faith in him; his baptism, the story of his Passion, his Resurrection, and his Ascension. The celebration of the Lord’s Supper as anticipation of the heavenly meal with the Messiah–Son of man in the coming <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>, even to the point of preserving in the liturgy the Aramaic exclamation <e>maranatha</e> (“O Lord, Come”) and its Greek parallel <e>erche kyrie</e> (“Come, Lord!”) as the supplicant calling for the Parousia (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="531409" tocid="">Second Coming</xref>)—all this became tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of special significance is the unique tradition of the oral transmission of teachings developed in Judaism. According to rabbinic doctrine, orally transmitted tradition coexisted on an equal basis with the written Law. Both text and tradition were believed to have been entrusted to Moses on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="545577" tocid="">Mount Sinai</xref>. The doctrinal contents of the tradition were initially passed on orally and memorized by the students. Because of the possibilities of error in a purely oral transmission, however, the extensive and growing body of tradition was, by necessity, fixed in written form. The rabbinic tradition of the <xref refid="1633290" ty="1" topicid="455129" tocid="">Pharisees</xref> (a Jewish sect that sanctioned the reinterpretation of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="599756" tocid="">Mosaic Law</xref>) was established in the <xref refid="1633270" ty="1" topicid="385262" tocid="">Mishna</xref> (commentaries) and later in the <xref refid="1633273" ty="1" topicid="439785" tocid="">Palestinian</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="47713" tocid="">Babylonian Talmud</xref> (compendiums of Jewish Law, lore, and commentary). Because the essence of tradition is never concluded—i.e., by its very nature is never completely fixed in writing—the learned discussion of tradition by necessity continued in constant exegetical debate with the Holy Scriptures. The written record of tradition, however, never claimed to be equal to the Holy Scriptures in Judaism. A similar process of written fixation also occurred among the sectarians of the community at Qumran, which in its <e>Manual of Discipline</e> and in the <e>Damascus Document</e> recorded its interpretation of the Law, developed first orally in the tradition.
            </p>
            <p>In the Christian church a tradition proceeding from Jesus himself was formed. The oral transmission of the tradition was written down between the end of the 1st and the first half of the 2nd century in the form of various gospels, histories of the Apostles, letters, sermonic literature, and apocalypses. Among Christian Gnostics the tradition also included what was believed to be secret communications of the risen Christ to his disciples.</p>
            <p>
              A new element, however, inhered in the Christian in relation to the Jewish tradition. For Jewish piety, revelation encompassed two forms of divine expression: the Law and the Prophets. This revelation is considered concluded with the last Prophets, and its actualization further ensues through interpretation. In the Christian church the tradition is joined not only to the teachings of Jesus and the story of his life as prophet and teacher but also to the central event of the history of salvation, which his life, Passion, death, and Resurrection represent—namely, to the resurrected Christ who is henceforth present as the living Lord of the church and guides and increases it through his <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref>. This led to the literary form of church tradition—the Holy Scripture. As the “New Testament,” it takes its place next to the Holy Scripture of Judaism, henceforth reinterpreted as the “Old Testament.” The tradition of the church itself thereby entered into the characteristic Christian tension between spirit and letter. The spirit creates tradition but also breaks tradition as soon as the latter is solidified into an external written form and thus impedes charismatic life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout church history, however, the core of this field of tension has been formed by the transmission of the Christ event—the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="315576" tocid="">kerygma</xref>—itself. On the one hand, the kerygma is the bearer and starting point for tradition; on the other hand, it molds the impetus for ever-new impulses toward charismatic, fresh interpretations and, under certain circumstances, suggests or even enforces elimination of accumulated traditions. Decisive in this respect is the self-understanding of the church. According to the self-understanding of the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches, the church, as the institution of Jesus Christ, is the bearer of the oral and the written tradition and the creator of the New Testament canon. The church’s selection of canonical writings presupposes a dogmatic distinction between “ecclesiastical” teachings—which, in the opinion of its responsible leaders, are “apostolic”—and “heretical” teachings. It thereby already presupposes a far-reaching intellectualization of the tradition and its identification with “doctrine.” The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="212142" tocid="">oral tradition</xref> thus became formalized in fixed creedal formulas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accordingly, in the history of the Christian church a specific, characteristic dialectic has been evidenced between periods of excessive growth and formalistic hardening of tradition that hindered and smothered the charismatic life of the church and periods of a reduction of tradition that follow new reformational movements. The latter occurred, in part, within the church itself, such as in the reforms of Cluny, the Franciscans, and the Dominicans; they also took on the form of revolutionary movements. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> of the 16th century broke with the institution of monasticism, the liturgical and sacramental tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, and certain elements of doctrinal tradition. Luther, however, was more conservative in his attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church than were Zwingli and Calvin. The Anabaptists and other Enthusiasts (<e>Schwärmer</e>) went even further, demanding and practicing a revolutionary break with the entire Roman Catholic tradition. The churches that arose from the Reformation, however, soon created their own traditions, which emerged from the confessional writings and doctrines of the reformers. The rejection of the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church had practical as well as dogmatic effects—e.g., the eating of sausage on fast days in Zürich at the start of Zwingli’s reformation or the provocative marriages of monks and nuns.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 19th century, a period of progressive political revolutions and anti-Catholic movements such as the <xref refid="1633294" ty="1" topicid="324668" tocid="">Kulturkampf</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref> sought to safeguard its tradition—threatened on all sides—through an emphatic program of “antimodernism.” It endeavoured to protect tradition both by law and through theology (e.g., in returning to neo-Thomism). The representatives of this development were the popes from <xref refid="1633296" ty="1" topicid="462365" tocid="">Pius IX</xref> (reigned 1846–78) to <xref refid="1633295" ty="1" topicid="462400" tocid="">Pius XII</xref> (reigned 1939–58). With Pope <xref refid="1633297" ty="1" topicid="304913" tocid="">John XXIII</xref> (reigned 1958–63), a dismantling (<e>aggiornamento</e>) of antimodernism and a more critical attitude toward “tradition” set in; this extended to traditional dogmatic views as well as to the liturgy and church structure. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Second Vatican Council</xref> (1962–65) guided this development into moderate channels. On the other hand, an opposite development took place in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="614785" tocid="">Soviet Union</xref> and the eastern European countries. In these nations the remains of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref>, which survived extermination campaigns of the Leninist and Stalinist eras from the 1920s to the 1950s, preserved themselves in a political environment hostile to the church precisely through a retreat to their church tradition and religious functioning in the realm of the liturgy. From the late 1980s the Orthodox Church experienced greater religious freedom and new growth, as the openly hostile governments in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe dissolved with the fall of communism. In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref>, the Orthodox Church in the latter part of the 20th century viewed its task as the bearer of Christian tradition against the predominant social-ethical tendencies of certain Protestant member churches that disregarded or de-emphasized the tradition of the church in a wave of antihistorical sentiment.

The theology of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref> also fixed the number of sacraments at seven. The classical Protestant churches (i.e., Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed) have accepted only two sacraments, baptism and the Eucharist, though Luther allowed that penance was a valid part of sacramental theology.
              </p>
              <p>
                The New Testament mentions a series of “holy acts” that are not, strictly speaking, sacraments. Though the Roman Catholic Church recognizes a difference between such “holy acts,” which are called sacramentals, and sacraments, the Orthodox Church does not, in principle, make such strict distinctions. Baptism and the Eucharist, therefore, have been established as sacraments of the church, but <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="203773" tocid="">foot washing</xref>, which replaces the Lord’s Supper in The Gospel According to John, was not maintained as a sacrament. It is still practiced on special occasions, such as on Holy Thursday (the Thursday preceding Easter Sunday) in the Roman Catholic Church and as a rite prior to the observance of the Lord’s Supper, as in the Church of the Brethren. The “holy acts” of the Orthodox Church are symbolically connected to its most important mysteries. Hence, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52311" tocid="">baptism</xref> consists of a triple immersion that is connected with a triple renunciation of Satan that the candidates say and act out symbolically prior to the immersions.

                </thumbasm>The most important creation of church tradition is that of the Holy Scriptures themselves and, secondarily, their <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="197930" tocid="">exegesis</xref> (critical interpretations and explanations). Exegesis first appeared in Christian circles among Gnostic heretics and the church catechists (teachers)—e.g., in the Christian school systems, such as in Alexandria and Antioch. The heretics, who could not claim the unbroken apostolic tradition maintained by the orthodox Christian churches, had an interest in claiming the tradition to justify their own movements. Thus, exegesis was directly related to the development of a normative scriptural canon in the orthodox churches. Eventually it contributed to the emergence of the catechetical schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first representatives of early church exegesis were not the bishops but rather the “teachers” (<e>didaskaloi</e>) of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99329" tocid="">catechetical schools</xref>, modeled after the Hellenistic philosophers’ schools in which interpretive and philological principles had been developed according to the traditions of the founders of the respective schools. The allegorical interpretation of Greek classical philosophical and poetical texts, which was prevalent at the Library and Museum (the school) of Alexandria, for example, directly influenced the exegetical method of the Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99329" tocid="">catechetical school</xref> there. Basing his principles on the methods of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456612" tocid="">Philo of Alexandria</xref> and Clement of Alexandria, his teacher, and others, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref>—the Christian catechetical school’s most significant representative—created the foundation for the type of Christian exegesis (i.e., the typological-allegorical method) that lasted from the patristic period and the Middle Ages until the time of Luther in the 16th century. Origen based his exegesis upon comprehensive textual-critical work that was common to current Hellenistic practices, such as collecting Hebrew texts and Greek parallel translations of the Old Testament. His main concern, however, was that of ascertaining the spiritual meaning of the Scriptures, the trans-historical divine truth that is hidden in the records of the history of salvation. He thus developed a system containing four types of interpretation: literal, moral, typological, and allegorical. The fourfold sense of Scripture would come to dominate medieval exegesis, though the allegorical understanding of Scripture was the most common form of interpretation.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the Reformation, under the leadership of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Luther</xref>, the literal meaning of the Scriptures usurped the preeminence of the allegorical view. The literal interpretation of Scripture had its beginnings in the early church in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28327" tocid="">school of Antioch</xref>. In contrast to the Platonic tradition of the school of Alexandria, the school of Antioch was guided by Aristotelian philosophy. In place of allegorizing, which was consciously rejected, Antiochene exegesis was occupied with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="589489" tocid="">textual criticism</xref>. Both traditions often were included together in the so-called glosses of the Latin Middle Ages, such as in the <e>Glossa ordinaria</e> (“Ordinary Glosses”), edited by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="26778" tocid="">Anselm of Laon</xref> (died 1117), and the <e>Postillae</e>—the first biblical commentary to be printed (1471–72)—of <xref refid="1633307" ty="1" topicid="414169" tocid="">Nicholas of Lyra</xref> (<e>c.</e> 1270–1349).
              </p>
              <p>
                According to his own statement, Luther’s inspiration came about through reflection on the Scriptures—<e>legendo et docendo </e>(“by perusing and teaching”)—in connection with his lectures on the Bible at the university of Wittenberg in Germany. He used the preliminary work of humanist philologists for the restoration of the Old and New Testament text (e.g., Erasmus’s 1516 edition of the Greek New Testament in the lectures on the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508652" tocid="">Letter of Paul to the Romans</xref>). Luther replaced the traditional schema of the fourfold meaning of the Scripture with a spiritual interpretation of the letter—i.e., one based on Christ. Inasmuch as the letter, which speaks historically of the work of Christ, at the same time always means this work as the salvation event that has happened “for us,” it always contains the spiritual meaning in itself. In debates with the Spiritualists and Enthusiasts, who made use of the allegorical-tropological (figurative) method, Luther appealed ever more strongly to the unequivocal “clarity” of the letter of the Scriptures, which contains the “clarity” of the “subject” expressed by it. His exegesis is thus also a dogmatic one. The struggle between historical and tropological exegesis was emphasized in the debate between Luther and Zwingli over the understanding of the Lord’s Supper.

                During the early 18th century, biblical interpretation free of dogmatic interest was achieved among theologians accused of heresy by orthodox colleagues of their confession, such as among the Dutch Arminians (e.g., <xref refid="1633310" ty="1" topicid="246809" tocid="">Hugo Grotius</xref> and Johann Jakob Wettstein). Interest in the history of the Old and New Testament period was growing; ancient Middle Eastern history, biblical geography and archaeology, and the history of the religions of Hellenism were included in the interpretation of the Scriptures. Historical criticism of the Bible, which was independent of the moral and edifying evaluation of the Holy Scriptures, emerged under the influence of the Enlightenment and remained an important approach in Bible studies in the 19th and 20th centuries.

              <p>
                In addition to the tradition of the Holy Scriptures and its interpretation, traditions centring on holy places also developed. The veneration of holy places is the oldest expression of Christian popular piety. From Judaism Christianity adopted the idea and practice of venerating holy places. In post-exilic Judaism (i.e., after the 5th century <e ty="s">bc</e>), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302812" tocid="">Jerusalem</xref> was the sanctuary and the centre of the Jews in Palestine and the destination of the pilgrimages of Jews of the Diaspora. After the destruction in <e ty="s">ad</e> 70 of Jerusalem, which had become the holy city for the early church, it remained for Christians—as the site of the suffering and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and as the place of his return in glory—a holy city and a goal of pilgrimages. Early bishops such as <xref refid="1633427" ty="1" topicid="373974" tocid="">Melito of Sardis</xref> and Alexander of Jerusalem and theologians, including Origen, made pilgrimages to Jerusalem. When Christianity became the state church in the 4th century, pilgrimages to the holy places in Palestine became increasingly popular.

The idea that the martyrs are present at the places of their martyrdom (e.g., Peter’s tomb at the Vatican) secured a prominent position for holy places connected with the cult of saints and martyrs. The cult of the martyrs was developed especially in the Roman <xref refid="1633442" ty="1" topicid="99008" tocid="">catacombs</xref>, and it contributed to the formation of the Petrine doctrine and the teaching of the primacy of the Roman bishop. After the 4th century it spread further and created an abundance of new holy places in the West, including <xref refid="1633455" ty="1" topicid="523241" tocid="">Santiago de Compostela </xref>in Spain, the site of the tomb of the apostle St. James and one of the great pilgrimage centres of Christendom; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="605114" tocid="">Trier</xref> in Germany, with the tomb of the apostle <xref refid="1633460" ty="1" topicid="369769" tocid="">Matthias</xref>, which exerted a special power of attraction through the relic of the holy robe; and Marburg in Germany, with the shrine of <xref refid="1633461" ty="1" topicid="184889" tocid="">St. Elizabeth of Hungary</xref>, a 13th-century princess known for her devotion to the poor. In the Middle Ages, holy places became places of grace, the visitation of which was considered a work of penance.

              <p>
                The original historical consciousness of the Christian Church is also alive in the cult of relics, which began as a result of veneration of a martyr at his or her tomb, over which later was erected an altar of the church built to honour the saint. From the 4th century on in the East, and later also in the West, the remains of the martyrs were distributed in order that as many as possible could share in their miraculous power. Fragments of relics, in which the saint is believed to be present, were sewn into a silken cloth (antimension), a practice still used in some churches, and the Eucharist could be celebrated only upon an altar that was covered with such an antimension. In times of persecution the Eucharist could be celebrated upon any table, as long as it was covered with the antimension and consecrated through the presence of the martyr. In the Latin Church relics are enclosed in a cavity (<e>sepulcrum</e>) in the altar top. During the deconsecration of a church, the relic is again removed from the <e>sepulcrum</e>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the late Middles Ages the character of the pilgrimage, just like the veneration of relics, suffered degeneration in connection with the degeneration of the sacrament of penance because of the abuse of the <xref refid="1633466" ty="1" topicid="286800" tocid="">indulgence</xref>. Luther’s critique of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="286800" tocid="">indulgence</xref> began with a criticism of the display of the elector of Saxony <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="217935" tocid="">Frederick III</xref> the Wise’s imposing collection of relics in the Schlosskirche (Castle Church) of Wittenberg on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="15913" tocid="">All Saints’ Day</xref> (1516).

                </thumbasm>Monasticism emerged in the late 3rd century and had become an established institution in the Christian church by the 4th century. The first Christian monks, who had developed an enthusiasm for asceticism, appeared in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="180382" tocid="">Egypt</xref> and Syria. Notably including St. Anthony, the founder of Christian monasticism, they appeared as solitary figures who, out of a desire for further and more advanced isolation, established themselves in tombs, in abandoned or half-deteriorated human settlements, in caves, and, finally, in the wilderness of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="158992" tocid="">desert</xref> to do battle against the desires of the flesh and the wiles of the devil. Soon there were great numbers of desert anchorites, living solitary lives of devotion to God and coming together for weekly prayer services. The pious lifestyle of these earliest holy men attracted numerous imitators and admirers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain writings that captured the spirit of monasticism were essential for the development of this way of life in the church. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40590" tocid="">Athanasius</xref> of Alexandria, the 4th century’s most significant bishop spiritually and in terms of ecclesiastical politics, wrote the <e>Life of St. Antony</e>, which described the eremitic (hermit) life in the desert and the awesome struggle of ascetics with demons as the model of the life of Christian perfection. The <e>Life</e> had a profound impact on its many readers and was one of the first great testimonials praising the emerging monastic tradition.

                A former Roman soldier of the 4th century, <xref refid="1633501" ty="1" topicid="437526" tocid="">Pachomius</xref>, created the first cenobitic, or communal, monastery. He united the monks under one roof and one abbot (father, or leader). In 323 he founded the first true monastic cloister in Tabennisi, north of Thebes, in Egypt, and joined together houses of 30 to 40 monks, each with its own superior. Pachomius also created a monastic rule, though it served more as a regulation of external monastic life than as spiritual guidance. During the remainder of the 4th century, monasticism soon developed in areas outside Egypt. Athanasius brought the monastic rule of Pachomius to the West during his banishment (340–346) to Trier, Germany—as a result of his opposition to the imperially sanctioned heretical doctrines of Arianism. Mar Awgin, a Syrian monk, introduced the monastic rule in Mesopotamia, and Jerome established a monastic cloister in Bethlehem.

He was the creator of a monastic rule that, through constant variations and modifications, became authoritative for later <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox</xref> monasticism. The Rule of Basil has preserved the Orthodox combination of asceticism and mysticism into the 21st century.

                Western monasticism, which has been shaped by the rule of <xref refid="1633503" ty="1" topicid="60548" tocid="">Benedict of Nursia</xref>, has been characterized by two distinct developments. The first consists of its clericalization. In modern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic</xref> cloisters, monks are, except for the serving brothers (<e>fratres</e>), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="431536" tocid="">ordained</xref> priests and are thereby drawn in a direct way into the ecclesiastical tasks of the Roman Church. Originally, however, monks were laymen. Pachomius had explicitly forbidden monks to become priests on the ground that “it is good not to covet power and glory.” Basil the Great, however, by means of a special vow and a special ceremony, enabled monks to cease being just laymen and to attain a position between clergy and laity. Even in the 21st century, monks of the Orthodox Church are, for the most part, from the laity; only a few fathers (abbots) of each cloister are ordained priests (<e>hieromonachoi</e>), who are thus allowed to administer the sacraments.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second special development in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholicism</xref> consists of the functional characteristics of its many orders. The individual orders aid the church in its various areas of activity—e.g., missions, education, care for the sick and needy, and combating heresy. Developing a wide-ranging diversification in its structure and sociological interests, Roman Catholic monasticism has extended all the way from the knightly orders to orders of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="374839" tocid="">mendicant</xref> friars, and it has included orders of decided feudal and aristocratic characteristics alongside orders of purely bourgeois characteristics. To the degree that special missionary, pedagogical, scholarly-theological, and ecclesiastically political tasks of the orders increased in the West, the character of ancient monasticism—originally focused completely on prayer, meditation, and contemplation—receded more and more in importance. Few monastic orders—the Benedictines and the Carmelites are notable exceptions—still attempt to preserve the ancient character and purposes of monasticism in Roman Catholicism.

              <p>
                The term <e>saint</e> was originally a self-designation of all Christians. “The saints,” according to the First Letter of Paul to the Corinthians (1:31), are “sanctified through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God.” Saints were also understood as Christians who endeavoured to fulfill the binding demand of holiness in obedience to God and in love of their neighbours (2 Corinthians 7:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:3) or as charismatic figures in whom the gifts of the Holy Spirit operated according to their personal and temporal circumstances. Because of certain views on being “called to holiness,” members of many sects have designated themselves as “the saints”—from <xref refid="1633509" ty="1" topicid="143822" tocid="">Oliver Cromwell</xref>’s “saints” in 17th-century England to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="392525" tocid="">Mormon</xref> “latter-day saints” from the 19th to the 21st century.
              </p>
              <p>
                The general meaning of <e>saint</e> was transformed during the period of the persecutions of Christians in the Roman Empire. The martyr, the witness in blood to Christ and follower in his suffering, became the prototypical saint. Veneration of the saints began because of a belief that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367142" tocid="">martyrs</xref> were received directly into <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="258844" tocid="">heaven</xref> after their martyrdoms and that their intercession with God was especially effective—in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="500324" tocid="">Revelation to John</xref> the martyrs occupy a special position in heaven, immediately under the altar of God (Revelation 6:9). The veneration of confessors (i.e., those who had not denied their belief in Christ but had not been martyred), bishops, popes, early <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Fathers</xref>, and ascetics who had led a godlike life was established soon after cessation of the persecutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Greek</xref> church the saints were regarded as charismatic figures in whom the prototype of Christ is reflected in multifarious images. Veneration of the saints in the Orthodox churches was thus based more upon the idea that the saints provided instructional examples of the Christian life of sanctification. In the West, however, cultic veneration of the saints, the concept of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446761" tocid="">patron saints</xref>, and the view that saints are helpers for those in need became predominant. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the veneration of saints came under the control of the papacy, which established a process of canonization strictly defined by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="92870" tocid="">canon law</xref>. The saints thus dominated the church calendar, which notes the names of the ecclesiastically recognized saints of each day of the year. They are venerated on a particular day in the prayer of intercession, and references are made to their deeds, sufferings, and miracles in the liturgy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under Pope <xref refid="1633574" ty="1" topicid="446981" tocid="">Paul VI</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref> attempted to reduce the significance of the veneration of saints—and thereby emphasize the idea of their historical exemplariness—by deleting some legendary figures from the calendar of saints, most notably St. Christopher. The deletion, however, has had little influence on popular piety. Pope <xref refid="1633575" ty="1" topicid="305139" tocid="">John Paul II</xref>, fully respectful of the directions of the Second Vatican Council, nonetheless paid renewed respect to some of the pre-council forms of devotion which the reformers had tended to displace. His respect for the traditional veneration of saints was further demonstrated by the fact that he performed far more canonizations than had any previous pope.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early church the veneration of saints at first was restricted to celebrations at their tombs, but the cult of saintly relics soon spread the devotion to particular saints to many areas. The <e>

                </e>, for example, called the remains of the bishop <xref refid="1633576" ty="1" topicid="468353" tocid="">Polycarp of Smyrna</xref>, martyred in 155, “more precious than costly stones and more excellent than gold.” A belief in the need of special protection by saints is the basis of the system of patron saints. Saints became patrons of cities, regions, vocational groups, or classes, and most Roman Catholic churches have a saint as their patron, whose presence in the church is represented by a particular relic. Saints also won a special significance as patrons of names: in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches a Christian generally received the name of the saint on whose holiday (day of death) he is baptized. The believer was thus joined for life with the patron of his name through the name and the name day, which, as the day of rebirth (i.e., baptism), is of much greater significance than the natural birthday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Reformation did not in theory deny the significance of the saints as historical witnesses to the power and grace of God, it did eliminate their veneration and remove their images and relics from churches and homes. Luther’s view that all believers are saints contributed to this development. At the same time, the experience of martyrdom in the persecutions of the Reformation and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="140219" tocid="">Counter-Reformation</xref> encouraged the development of a new saintly ideal in the radical Protestant sects. In the 20th century, the Swedish archbishop <xref refid="1633589" ty="1" topicid="552036" tocid="">Nathan Söderblom</xref>’s attempt to develop a new understanding of the notion of the saint led to a rediscovery of saints in the Protestant realm. In modern Roman Catholicism, emphasis is increasingly being placed upon the charismatic aspects of the saints and their significance as models of a spiritual, holy Christian life.

                </thumbasm>Christian art constitutes an essential element of the religion. Until the 17th century the history of Western art was largely identical with the history of Western ecclesiastical and religious art. During the early history of the Christian Church, however, there was very little Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="175749" tocid="">art</xref>, and the church generally resisted it with all its might. Clement of Alexandria, for example, criticized religious (pagan) art for encouraging people to worship that which is created rather than the Creator. There was also little need for Christian art, because monumental churches had yet to be built and there were few wealthy patrons to commission it. By the late 2nd century an incipient pictorial art had appeared in the Christian Church, and by the mid-3rd century art inspired by pagan models as well as Christian themes began to be produced. Pictures began to be used in the churches when Christianity was legalized and supported by the Roman emperor Constantine in the early 4th century, and they soon struck roots in Christian popular religiosity.
              </p>
              <p>
                A number of factors explain the slow development of Christian art in the early centuries of the church. Christianity received from its Jewish origins a prohibition against the use of images to depict the sacred or holy, including humans, who were created in “the image of God.” The early church was also deeply involved in a struggle against paganism—which, to the Christian observer, was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="282044" tocid="">idolatry</xref> in that its many gods were represented in various pictorial and statuary forms. In early Christian missionary preaching, the Old Testament attacks upon pagan veneration of images were transferred directly to pagan image veneration of the first three centuries <e ty="s">ad</e>. The struggle against images was conducted as a battle against “idols” with all the intensity of faith in the oneness and exclusiveness of the imageless biblical God. The abhorrence of images was strengthened further by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="186034" tocid="">emperor</xref>’s cult, which Christians so despised. Christians were compelled to venerate the imperial images by offering sacrifices to them; refusal to make sacrifice was the chief cause of martyrdom. Characteristically, then, the church’s reaction to its public recognition was expressed in the riotous destruction of pagan divine images.
              </p>
              <p>
                In spite of these very strong religious and emotional restraints, the church developed a form of art peculiar to its needs. From late antiquity to the time of the Counter-Reformation, Western art was essentially the art of the church; both lay and secular patrons commissioned works of art that illustrated important Christian themes and stood as testimony to their own faith. Assuming many forms, Christian art could be found in private homes, churches, and public spaces. Churches, themselves artistic triumphs, were adorned with a broad range of art, including statuary, paintings, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="562530" tocid="">stained glass</xref>. Another important form was illumination; <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283009" tocid="">illuminated manuscripts</xref> were prized possessions and often displayed on high holy days. The attitude reflected in these practices was expressed in the famous dictum of Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Gregory I</xref>, that art is the book of the illiterate; art was thus conceived as having a didactic function.

                The starting point for the development of Christian pictorial art lies in the basic teaching of the Christian revelation itself—namely, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="284611" tocid="">incarnation</xref>, the point at which the Christian proclamation is differentiated from Judaism. The incarnation of the Son of man, the Messiah, in the form of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human being</xref>—who was created in the “image of God”—granted theological approval of a sort to the use of images that symbolized Christian truths. Clement of Alexandria, at one point, called God “the Great Artist,” who formed humans according to the image of the Logos, the archetypal light of light. The great theological struggles over the use of images within the church, particularly in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="87186" tocid="">Byzantine Empire</xref>, during the period of the so-called <xref refid="1633652" ty="1" topicid="281492" tocid="">Iconoclastic Controversy</xref> in the 8th and 9th centuries indicate how a new understanding of images emerged on the basis of Christian doctrine. This new understanding was developed into a theology of icons that still prevails in the Eastern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref> in the 21st century.

                The great significance of images of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="516666" tocid="">saints</xref> for the Orthodox faithful is primarily expressed in the cultic veneration of the images within the worship service. Second, it is expressed in the dogmatic fixation of the figures, gestures, and colours in Eastern Church iconic art. In the West, the creative achievement of the individual artist is admired, but Orthodox painting dispenses with the predominance of the individual painter’s freely creative imagination. Throughout the centuries the Eastern Church has been content with reproducing certain types of holy images, and only seldom does an individual artist play a predominant role within the history of Orthodox Church painting. Most Orthodox ecclesiastical artists have remained anonymous. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="281469" tocid="">Icon</xref> painting is viewed as a holy skill that is practiced in cloisters in which definite schools of painting have developed. In the schools, traditional principles prevail so much that different artist-monks generally perform only certain functions in the production of a single icon. Style motifs—e.g., composition, impartation of colour, hair and beard fashions, and gestures of the figures—are fixed in painting books that contain the canons of the different monastic schools of icon painters.

              <p>
                The significance of the image of the saint in the theology, piety, and liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church can be judged historically from the fact that the struggle over holy images within Orthodox Church history brought about a movement whose scope and meaning can be compared only with the Reformation of Luther and Calvin. In the 7th century a tendency hostile to images and fostered by both theological and political figures gained ground within the Byzantine Church and upset Orthodox Christendom to its very depths; known as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="281492" tocid="">Iconoclastic Controversy</xref>, it was supported by some reform-minded emperors. Although opponents of icons had all the political means of power at their disposal, they were not able to succeed in overthrowing the use of icons. The conclusion of this struggle with the victory of the supporters of the use of icons is celebrated in the entire Orthodox Church on the first Sunday of Lent as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="433434" tocid="">Feast of Orthodoxy</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>Orthodox icon painting is not to be separated from its ecclesiastical and liturgical function. The painting of the image is, in fact, a liturgical act in which the artist-monks prepare themselves by fasting, doing penance, and consecrating the materials necessary for the painting. Before the finished icon is used, it likewise is consecrated. Not viewed as a human work, an icon (according to 8th- and 9th-century literature) was understood instead as a manifestation of a heavenly archetype. A golden background is used on icons to indicate a heavenly perspective. The icon is always painted two-dimensionally because it is viewed as a window through which worshipers can view the heavenly archetype from their earthly position. A figure in the three-dimensionality of the plastic arts, such as sculpture, would thus be an abandonment of the character of epiphany (appearance).</p>
              <p>
                Ideas of the iconic liturgy dominate the manuals of the Orthodox icon painters. The model of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Christ</xref> figure for icon painters was found in an apocryphal writing of the early church—the <e>Letter of Lentulus</e>, supposedly written by a certain Lentulus, who was named consul in the 12th year of the emperor Tiberius. As the superior of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="460341" tocid="">Pontius Pilate</xref>, the procurator of Judaea, he by chance was staying in Palestine at the time of the trial of Jesus. In an official report to the emperor about the trial of Jesus, Lentulus included an official warrant for Jesus with a description of the Christ. This apocryphal description furnished the basic model for the Byzantine Christ type.

                The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="605512" tocid="">Trinity</xref> also may not be represented, except in those forms in which, according to the view of Orthodox church doctrine, the Trinity showed itself in the divine Word of the Old and New Testaments. Early church theology interpreted an Old Testament passage (Genesis 18:1 ff.) as an appearance of the divine Trinity—namely, the visit of the three men with the patriarch Abraham at Mamre in Palestine. Also included in icons of the Trinity are the appearance of the three divine persons—symbolized as a hand, a man, and a dove—at the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:16 ff.) and the Pentecostal scene, in which the Lord, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of God and the Comforter (the Holy Spirit) is sent down to the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues (Acts 2). Another Trinitarian iconic scene is the Transfiguration of Jesus at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="579847" tocid="">Mount Tabor</xref> (Matthew 17:2).

                Icons of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Mary</xref> were probably first created because of the development of Marian doctrines in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The lack of New Testament descriptions of Mary was compensated by numerous legends of Mary that concerned themselves especially with wondrous appearances of miraculous icons of the mother of God. In Russian and many other Orthodox churches, including the monasteries at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="40993" tocid="">Mount Athos</xref>, such miraculous mother of God icons, “not made by hands,” have been placed where the appearances of the mother of God took place.
              </p>
              <p>The consecration liturgy of the icons of saints expresses the fact that the saints themselves, for their part, are viewed as likenesses of Christ. In them, the image of God has been renewed again through the working of salvation of the incarnate Son of God.</p>

              <headtitle>Theology of icons</headtitle>
              <p>The foes of images explicitly deny that the New Testament, in relation to the Old Testament, contains any new attitude toward images. Their basic theological outlook is that the divine is beyond all earthly form in its transcendence and spirituality; representation in earthly substances and forms of the divine already indicate its profanation. The relationship to God, who is Spirit, can only be a purely spiritual one; the worship of the individual as well as the community can happen only “in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24). Similarly, the divine archetype can also be realized only spiritually and morally in life. The religious path of the action of God upon humans is not the path of external influence upon the senses but rather that of spiritual action upon the mind and the will. Such an effect does not come about through the art of painting. Opponents of icons thus claim that the only way to reach an understanding of the truth is by studying the writings of the Old and New Testaments, which are filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
              <p>
                The decisive contrast between the iconodules (image lovers) and the iconoclasts (image destroyers) is found in their understanding of Christology. The iconodules based their theology upon the view of Athanasius—who reflected <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14441" tocid="">Alexandrian</xref> Christology—that Christ, the God become human, is the visible, earthly, and corporeal icon of the heavenly Father, created by God himself. The iconoclasts, on the other hand, explain, in terms of ancient <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28327" tocid="">Antiochene</xref> Christology, that the image conflicts with the ecclesiastical dogma of the Person of the Redeemer. It is unseemly, according to their views, to desire to portray a personality such as Christ, who is himself divine, because that would mean pulling the divine down into the materialistic realm.
              </p>
              <p>The history of iconoclasm began in the early church with an emphatic (and, from the viewpoint of lovers of Greek and Roman culture, catastrophic) iconoclastic movement that led to the annihilation of nearly all of the sacred art of the pagan religions of the Roman Empire. In Western Christendom, an iconoclastic attitude was again expressed in various medieval lay movements and sects. Iconoclasm underwent a revolutionary outbreak in the 16th-century Reformation in Germany, France, and England. Despite the different historical types of iconoclasm, a surprising uniformity in regard to their affective structure and theological argumentation exists. The Iconoclastic Controversy of the 8th and 9th centuries also became a point of contention in the Western Church. To be sure, the latter had recognized the seventh ecumenical council at Nicaea (787), in which iconoclasm was condemned. Nevertheless, an entirely different situation existed in the West. The Frankish–Germanic Church was a young church in which images were much more infrequent than in the old Byzantine Church, in which holy icons had accumulated over the centuries. In the West there was still no Christian pictorial art as highly developed as in the East. Also, Christianity there did not have to struggle against a highly developed pagan pictorial art. Donar, a Germanic god, reputedly whispered in a holy oak, and Boniface merely had to fell the Donar oak in order to demonstrate the superiority of Christ over the pagan god. Among the Germanic tribes in the West, there was no guild of sculptors or goldsmiths, as in Ephesus (Acts 19:24 ff.), who would have been able to protest in the name of their gods against the Christian iconoclasts.</p>
              <p>
                The Western viewpoint is revealed most clearly in the formulations of the synodal decisions on the question of images, as they were promulgated in the Frankish kingdom in the <e>Libri Carolini</e>, a theological treatise composed primarily by Theodulf of Orléans at Charlemagne’s request. In this work it is emphasized that images have only a representative character. Thus, they are understood not as an appearance of the saint but only as a visualization of the holy persons for the support of recollecting spiritual meanings that have been expounded intellectually through sermons. Hence, this led to an essentially instructional and aesthetic concept of images. The Western Church also viewed images as the Holy Scriptures’ substitute for the illiterate—i.e., for the overwhelming majority of church people in this period. Images thus became the Bible for the laity. Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6493" tocid="">Adrian I</xref>, who encouraged Western recognition of the iconodulic Council of Nicaea, also referred to the perspicuity of the icons. This idea of perspicuity—i.e., the appeal to one’s imagination to picture the biblical persons and events to oneself—enabled him to recognize the Greek high esteem for the image without completely accepting the complicated theological foundation for icon veneration. The ideas articulated in the <e>Libri Carolini</e> remained decisive for the Western tradition. According to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>, one of the greatest medieval theologians of the West, images in the church serve a threefold purpose: (1) for the instruction of the uneducated in place of books; (2) for illustrating and remembering the mystery of the incarnation; and (3) for awakening the passion of devotion, which is kindled more effectively on the basis of viewing than through hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Western theology of icons, the omnipotence of the two-dimensionality of church art also was abandoned. Alongside church pictorial painting, ecclesiastical plastic arts developed; even painting in the three-dimensional form was introduced through the means of perspective. Art, furthermore, became embedded in the entire life of personal religiosity. The holy image became the devotional image; the worshiper placed himself before an image and became engrossed in his meditation of the mysteries of the Christian revelation. As devotional images, the images became the focal points for contemplation and mystical representation. Conversely, the mystical vision itself worked its way back again into pictorial art, in that what was beheld in the vision was reproduced in church art. The burden of ecclesiastical tradition, which weighs heavily upon <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="87136" tocid="">Byzantine art</xref>, has been gradually abolished in the Western Church. In the Eastern Church the art form is just as fixed as ecclesiastical dogma; nothing may be changed in the heavenly prototypes. This idea plays little or no role in the West. There, religious art adjusts itself at any given time to the total religious disposition of the church, to the general religious mental posture, and also to religious needs. Religious art in the West also has been shaped by the imaginative fantasy of the individual artist. Thus, from the outset, a much more individual church art developed in the West. Thus, it became possible to dissociate sacred history from its dogmatic milieu and to transpose it from the past into the actual present, thereby allowing for an adaptable development of ecclesiastical art.

            <h3 tocid="67522">
              <headtitle>Expectations of the Kingdom of God in early Christianity</headtitle>
              <p>In early Christianity’s expectation of the Kingdom of God, two types were inherited from Judaism. The first was the expectation of a messianic Kingdom in this world, with its centre in Jerusalem, which was to be established by an earthly Messiah from the house of David. The second expectation was that of a heavenly Kingdom, which was to be inaugurated by the heavenly Messiah, Son of man, and in which the elected comrades of the Kingdom from all times would share in the state of the resurrection.</p>
              <p>
                The two types of eschatological expectation did not remain neatly separated in the early church but rather intersected in manifold ways. Under the influence of the persecutions, a combination of the end-time expectations was established. In Paul’s letters and in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="500324" tocid="">Revelation to John</xref>, the notion emerged that faithful Christians will first reign together with their returning Lord for some time in this world. Those Christians who are still alive at his return will take part in the reign without dying (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Christians who have already died will rise again and, as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499816" tocid="">resurrected</xref> ones, share in the Kingdom upon Earth. Only after completion of this first act of the events of the end time will there then follow the general resurrection of all the dead and the <xref refid="1634288" ty="1" topicid="331102" tocid="">Last Judgment</xref>, in which the elect will participate as co-judges (1 Corinthians 6:2).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Revelation to John this expectation is condensed into the concept of the 1,000-year (<xref refid="1634289" ty="1" topicid="382720" tocid="">millennial</xref>) kingdom. The dragon (Satan) is to be chained up and thrown into the abyss, where he will remain for 1,000 years. In John’s vision, Christians, the first resurrected, “came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years” (Revelation 20:4). Only later does the resurrection of all the dead take place, as well as the general judgment, creation of the new heaven and the new Earth, and the descent of the new Jerusalem. According to the Revelation to John, this 1,000-year Kingdom is composed of the saints and martyrs and all who stood the test in times of persecution; it is a Kingdom of the privileged elect.
              </p>
              <p>This promise has exerted revolutionary effects in the course of church history. In the early church the expectation of the millennium was viewed as a social and political utopia, a state in which the chosen Christians would rule and judge with their Lord in this world. Such chiliastic (or millennial) expectations provided the impetus for ecclesiastical, political, and social reformations and revolutions in the course of church history. The establishment of a 1,000-year kingdom in which the elect, with Christ, will reign has fascinated religious expectations as well as political and social imagination far more than the second part of the eschatological expectation, the “Last Judgment.”</p>
              <p>
                The delay of the Parousia resulted in a weakening of the imminent expectation in the early church. In this process of “de-eschatologizing,” the institutional church increasingly replaced the expected Kingdom of God. The formation of the church as a hierarchical institution is directly connected with the declining of the imminent expectation. The theology of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine</xref> constitutes the conclusion of this development in the West. He de-emphasized the original imminent expectation by declaring that the Kingdom of God has already begun in this world with the institution of the church, which is the historical representative of the Kingdom of God on Earth. The first resurrection, according to Augustine, occurs constantly within the church in the sacrament of baptism, through which the faithful are introduced into the Kingdom of God. The expectation of the coming Kingdom of God, the resurrection of the faithful, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331102" tocid="">Last Judgment</xref> have become a doctrine of the “last things” because the gifts of salvation of the coming Kingdom of God are interpreted as being already present in the sacraments of the church.

              <p>
                Despite Augustine’s teachings to the contrary, the original imminent expectation has spontaneously and constantly reemerged in the history of Christianity. It was a powerful undercurrent throughout much of the Middle Ages, shaping numerous movements in that period. <xref refid="1634086" ty="1" topicid="106546" tocid="">Charlemagne</xref> and his advisors may have been motivated by eschatological concerns, including those associated with the legend of the “Last Emperor,” to accept imperial coronation on Christmas Day, 800. Indeed, several medieval rulers, including <xref refid="1634098" ty="1" topicid="434941" tocid="">Otto III</xref>, were inspired by the legend in which the Last Emperor struggles against the Antichrist in preparation for the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="531409" tocid="">Second Coming</xref>. About the year 1000, eschatological expectations influenced the <xref refid="1634099" ty="1" topicid="236624" tocid="">Peace of God</xref> movement (a social and religious reform movement that emerged in southern and central France), and numerous apparent signs and miracles suggested the imminence of Christ’s return. The knights of the First Crusade (1095–99), especially those involved in massacres of Jews in Germany, were most likely influenced by apocalyptic expectations. <xref refid="1634100" ty="1" topicid="304176" tocid="">Joachim of Fiore</xref> developed a millennialist theology and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267522" tocid="">philosophy of history</xref> that influenced the <xref refid="1770373" ty="1" topicid="560460" tocid="">Spiritual</xref> Franciscans in the 13th century.

In the medieval church new outbreaks of an imminent expectation also occurred in connection with great historical catastrophes, such as epidemics of the plague, Islamic invasions, schisms, and wars.

              <p>
                Luther’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> also was sustained by an imminent expectation. For the Reformers, the starting point for their eschatological interpretation of contemporary history was that the “internal Antichrist,” the pope, had established himself in the temple at the Holy Place and that through persecution by the “external Antichrist,” the Turk, the church had entered into the travails of the end time. The Reformation churches, however, soon became institutional territorial churches, which in turn repressed the end-time expectation, and thus doctrine of the “last things” became an appendix to dogmatics.

              <p>
                Although heightened apocalyptic fervour was quickly drained from the movements of the magisterial reformers (who received support from the civil powers or magistrates and who stressed the authority of teachers [Latin: <e>magister</e>]), the so-called radical reformers were often intensely eschatological, and some even advocated violence to usher in the Second Coming. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="397713" tocid="">Thomas Müntzer</xref>, inspired as much by the apocalyptic books of the Bible as by Luther, identified the poor as God’s special elect who were charged with overthrowing their earthly rulers to bring about God’s kingdom.

The sect led by Jan of Leiden at Munster was also radically and violently apocalyptic, and many <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22160" tocid="">Anabaptist</xref> groups expressed an imminent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="192308" tocid="">eschatology</xref>.

                In the post-Reformation period, the imminent expectation appeared in individual groups on the margin of the institutional Reformation churches; such groups generally made the imminent expectation itself the object of their sect formation.

In a similar way, the missionary movement of the 18th and 19th centuries also proceeded from such eschatological groups within Protestantism.

                The expectation of the Kingdom of God, in the form of the imminent expectation, plays a strong role in emigration movements. Great masses of European Christians again and again set out for Palestine with a sense of finding there the land of their salvation and being present when Christ returns there to establish his Kingdom. Mass pilgrimages to Jerusalem took place in 1033 and again in 1064–65, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="144695" tocid="">Crusades</xref> can be seen as a form of pilgrimage whose participants held eschatological concerns. The peasants of the so-called “People’s Crusade” and the knights of the First Crusade were clearly motivated by apocalyptic anxieties, and Count Emicho of Flonheim, who led the massacres of the Jews in Germany, may have seen himself in the role of the Last Emperor. The eschatological strain of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="144695" tocid="">Crusades</xref> can also be noted in the Crusade sermons of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="62413" tocid="">Bernard of Clairvaux</xref> in 1147, who kindled enthusiasm to liberate Jerusalem with reference to the pressing terminal dates of the end time.

                A great number of the attempts undertaken to found radical Christian communities in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">North America</xref> may be viewed as anticipations of the coming Jerusalem. The emigration movement toward <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">America</xref> was influenced by beliefs in eschatologically fixed dates (e.g., Columbus). Puritans who traveled to America in the 17th century and Quakers, Baptists, and Methodists in the 18th century believed that America was the “wilderness” promised in the Revelation to John. <xref refid="1634424" ty="1" topicid="449992" tocid="">William Penn</xref> gave the name <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="455799" tocid="">Philadelphia</xref> to the capital of the woodland areas ceded to him (1681) because he took up the idea of establishing the true church of the end time, represented by the Philadelphia community of the Revelation to John. The same influence holds true for the emigration of German revivalists of the 18th and early 19th centuries to Russia and Palestine. The “Friends of the Temple”—Swabians who went with Christoph Hoffmann to Palestine in 1866—and the Swabians, Franks, Hessians, and Bavarians, who after the Napoleonic Wars followed the call of Tsar Alexander I to Bessarabia, were all dominated by the idea of living in the end time and preparing themselves for the coming Kingdom of God. In Tsar Alexander I they saw the “eagle…as it flew in midheaven” (Revelation 8:13), which prepared the “recovery spot” for them in the East upon which Christ will descend.

                As had occurred earlier in Christian history, eschatological expectations in the modern age sometimes turned violent.

              </headtitle>
              <p>
                In the eyes of some theologians, the very process of secularization, which progressively rules out transcendent explanations of natural and historical conditions, has been a working out of a form of eschatological expectation. Of course, the substance is quite different in the cases where people work in expectation of the Kingdom of God and in the other cases where they become “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="222952" tocid="">futurologists</xref>.” But the impulse to prepare oneself for such futures has analogues and origins, it is contended, in old Christian ideas of penance and preparation for the coming Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="239489" tocid="">Gospels</xref> the attitude toward the coming Kingdom of God led, over and beyond the expectation of nullifying sin and death, to certain worldly conclusions of an organizational kind. The disciples of Jesus knew that there will be “first ones” in the Kingdom of Heaven; they pressed for the administrative posts in the coming Kingdom of God (e.g., the apostles James and John). The promise, too, that they are to take part as judges at the Last Judgment (Luke 22:30) sparked definite conceptions of rank. Jesus castigated them in their disputes over rank with the words, “If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” (Mark 9:35).
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite this warning, the imminent expectation of the coming Kingdom of God awakened concrete, substantial ideas that led ever closer to social <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="620755" tocid="">utopias</xref>. With the 18th-century German Lutheran mystic and Pietist F.C. Oetinger, the end-time expectation generated definite social and political demands—e.g., dissolution of the state, abolition of property, and elimination of class differences. Some of the aspects of the end-time expectation of Pietism were revived in the French Revolution’s political and social programs. The transition from the end-time expectation to the social utopia, however, had already been achieved in writings from the 16th and early 17th centuries—e.g., the English humanist and saint Thomas More’s <e>…de optimo reipublicae statu deque nova Insula Utopia</e> (1516; “On the Highest State of a Republic and on the New Island Utopia”), the German theologian Johann Valentin Andrea’s <e>Reipublicae Christianopolitanae Descriptio</e> (1619; “A Description of the Christian Republic”), the English philosopher Francis Bacon’s <e>New Atlantis</e> (1627), and the English bishop Francis Godwin’s <e>Man in the Moone</e> (1638). It is also found in early <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551569" tocid="">socialism</xref> of the 19th century—e.g., the French social reformer Henri de Saint-Simon’s <e>Nouveau Christianisme</e> (1825; “The New Christianity”) and the French Socialist Étienne Cabet’s <e>Voyage en Icarie</e> (1840; “Voyage to Icaria”).
              </p>
              <p>
                What distinguishes the Christian social utopia from the earlier kind of eschatology is the stronger emphasis upon social responsibility for the preparation of the Kingdom of God and a considerable preponderance of various techniques in the establishment of the utopian society. (In general, the end-time expectation has also inspired technical fantasy and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="528857" tocid="">science fiction</xref>.) Also characteristic is the basic attitude that people themselves must prepare the future perfect society in a formative and organizing manner and that “hoping” and “awaiting” are replaced by human initiative. A graduated transition from a social utopia still consciously Christian to a purely Socialist one can be observed in the writings and activities of the French Socialists <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="215092" tocid="">Charles Fourier</xref>, Saint-Simon, and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the English Socialist Robert Owen, and the German Socialist Wilhelm Weitling. Secularized remnants of a glowing Christian end-time expectation are still found even in the Marxist view of the social utopia.
              </p>
              <p>Modern planning and projection of alternative futures is a secularization of the end-time expectations previously envisioned in Christian terms. The future is thus manipulated through planning (i.e., “horizontal eschatology”) in place of eschatological “hoping” and “waiting for” fulfillment. “Horizontal eschatology” is thus taken out of the sphere of the unexpected and numinous (spiritual); it is made the subject not only of a detailed prognosis based upon statistics but also of a detailed programming undertaken on the basis of this prognosis. An eschatological remainder is found only in an ideological image of man, upon which programming and planning are based.</p>

              </headtitle>
              <p>The Christian end-time expectation is directed not only at the future of the church but also at the future of the individual believer. It includes definite conceptions of the personal continuance of life after death. Many baptized early Christians were convinced they would not die at all but would still experience the advent of Christ in their lifetimes and would go directly into the Kingdom of God without death. Others were convinced they would go through the air to meet Christ returning upon the clouds of the sky: “Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). In the early imminent expectation, the period between death and the coming of the Kingdom still constituted no object of concern. An expectation that one enters into bliss or perdition immediately after death is also found in the words of Jesus on the cross: “Today you will be with me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43).</p>
              <p>
                In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref> the life of the Christian is characterized as “eternal life.” In the Gospels and in the apostolic letters, “eternal” is first of all a temporal designation: in contrast to life of this world, eternal life has a deathless duration. In its essence, however, it is life according to God’s kind of eternity—i.e., perfect, sharing in his glory and bliss (Romans 2:7, 10). “Eternal life” in the Christian sense is thus not identical with “immortality of the soul”; rather, it is only to be understood in connection with the expectation of the resurrection. “Continuance” is neutral vis-à-vis the opposition of salvation and disaster, but the raising from the dead leads to judgment, and its decision can also mean eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46). The antithesis to eternal life is not earthly life but eternal death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eternal life is personal life, and precisely therein is fulfilled the essence of man who is created according to the image of God. Within eternal life there are differences. In the present life there are variations in talent, duty, responsibility, and breadth and height of life, just as there are also distinctions in “wages” according to the measure of the occupation, the sacrifice of suffering, and the trial (1 Corinthians 3:8). Correspondingly, the resurrected are also distinguished in eternal life according to their “glory”:<qt>
                  <qtpara>
                    There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory. So it is with the resurrection of the dead (1 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="137622" tocid="">Corinthians</xref> 15:41–42).

                </thumbasm>This expectation has had a great influence upon the Christian conception of marriage and friendship. The idea of a continuation of marriage and friendship after death has contributed very much to the deepening of the view of marriage, as is shown by the strong influence of the 17th–18th-century Swedish mystic, philosopher, and scientist Emanuel Swedenborg’s ideas upon the romantic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497132" tocid="">philosophy of religion</xref> and its interpretation of marriage and friendship in the thought of the German scholars Friedrich Schelling and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="527577" tocid="">Friedrich Schleiermacher</xref>. The Western concept of personality was thus deepened through the Christian view of its eternal value.
              </p>
              <p>
                The delay of the imminent expectation brought about the question of the fate of the dead person in the period between the death of the individual Christian and the resurrection. Two basic views were developed. One view is that of an individual judgment, which takes place immediately after death and brings the individual to an interim state, from which he enters into the realm of bliss or that of perdition. The idea of an individual judgment, however, cannot be readily harmonized with the concept of the general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331102" tocid="">Last Judgment</xref> on the day of the general <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499816" tocid="">resurrection</xref> of the dead. It anticipates the decision of the general judgment and thus deprives of its significance the notion of the Last Judgment. A second view, therefore, also prevailed: the sleep of the soul—i.e., the soul of the dead person enters into a sleeping state that continues until the Last Judgment, which will occur after the general resurrection. At the Last Judgment the resurrected will be assigned either to eternal life or eternal damnation. This conception, accepted in many churches, contains many discrepancies, especially the abandonment of the fundamental idea of the continuity of personal life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both views contain an inhuman consequence. The first leaves to people no further opportunity to improve the mistakes of their lives and to expiate their guilt. The second preserves the personality in an intermediate state for an indefinite period so as to later punish it for sins or reward it for good deeds from a time prior to entrance into the sleep of the soul. The belief in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="483923" tocid="">purgatory</xref> (an interim state in which a correction of a dead person’s evil condition is still possible) of the Roman Catholic Church gives the deceased opportunities for repentance and penance to ameliorate their situation.
              </p>
              <p>The presupposition of the doctrine of purgatory is that there is a special judgment for each individual at once after death. Hence, the logical conclusion is that purgatory ceases with the Last Judgment. The stay in purgatory can be shortened through intercession, alms, indulgences, and benefits of the sacrifice of the mass. The Eastern Orthodox Church has no doctrine of purgatory but does practice an intercession for the dead. It assumes that, on the basis of the connection between the church of the living and that of the dead, an exertion of influence upon the fate of the dead through intercession is possible before the time of the Last Judgment.</p>
              <p>
                The idea of the Last Judgment has often become incomprehensible to the modern world. At the most, people apparently are still open to the concept of judgment of the guilt and innocence of the individual. The idea decisive for the early church’s expectation of the Judgment, however, was that the Last Judgment will be a public one. This corresponds to the fundamental Christian idea that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref>—both the living and the dead—are bound together in an indissoluble communion; it presupposes the conception of the church as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">body of Christ</xref>. All of humanity is as one person. Humans sin with one another, and their evil is connected together in the “realm of sin” in a manifold way, unrecognizable in the individual. Each person is responsible for the other and is guilty with the other. The judgment upon each person, therefore, concerns all. Judgment upon the individual is thus at the same time judgment upon the whole, and vice versa. The Judgment is also public in regard to the positive side—the praise and reward of God for that which is done rightly and practiced in the common life, often without knowing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the most part, the churches of the early part of the 21st century no longer have the courage to uphold the Christian teaching of life after death. The church has long neglected teachings about the entire area of the last things. The New Testament responses presuppose the imminent expectation and thus leave many questions unanswered that arose because of the delay of the Parousia. The doctrine of the sleep of the soul, on the other hand, contains many consequences that question the fundamental idea of the Christian view of the personality of the <e>imago Dei</e> (“image of God”). The beginnings of a further development of the Christian view of life after death, as are found in Swedenborg, have never been recognized positively by the church. For this reason, since the period of Romanticism and idealism, ideas of the transmigration of souls and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="496541" tocid="">reincarnation</xref>, taken over from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="266312" tocid="">Hinduism</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="83184" tocid="">Buddhism</xref>, have gained a footing in Christian views of the end-time expectation. Some important impulses toward a new understanding of the view of life after death are found in Christian theosophy, such as the idea of a further development of the human personality upon other celestial bodies after death.

            <p>It has been debated whether there is anything that is properly called Christian philosophy. Christianity is not a system of ideas but a religion, a way of salvation. But as a religion becomes a distinguishable strand of human history, it absorbs philosophical assumptions from its environment and generates new philosophical constructions and arguments both in the formation of doctrines and in their defense against philosophical objections. Moreover, philosophical criticism from both within and without the Christian community has influenced the development of its beliefs.</p>

                <p>
                  As the Christian movement expanded beyond its original Jewish nucleus into the Greco-Roman world, it had to understand, explain, and defend itself in terms that were intelligible in an intellectual milieu largely structured by Greek philosophical thought. By the 2nd century <e ty="s">ad</e> several competing streams of Greek and Roman philosophy—Middle Platonism, <xref refid="1773132" ty="1" topicid="409036" tocid="">Neoplatonism</xref>, <xref refid="1773130" ty="1" topicid="189732" tocid="">Epicureanism</xref>, <xref refid="1773131" ty="1" topicid="566892" tocid="">Stoicism</xref>—had merged into a common worldview that was basically Neoplatonic, though enriched by the ethical outlook of the Stoics. This constituted the broad intellectual background for most educated people throughout the Roman Empire, functioning in a way comparable to the pervasive contemporary Western secular view of the universe as an autonomous system within which everything can in principle be understood scientifically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neoplatonic themes that provided intellectual material for Christian and non-Christian thinkers alike in the early centuries of the Common Era included a hierarchical conception of the universe, with the spiritual on a higher level than the physical; the eternal reality of such values as goodness, truth, and beauty and of the various universals that give specific form to matter; and the tendency of everything to return to its origin in the divine reality. The Christian Apologists, Christian writers of the 2nd century who provided a defense of the faith against prevailing Greco-Roman culture, were at home in this thought-world, and many of them used its ideas and assumptions both in propagating the Gospel and in defending it as a coherent and intellectually tenable system of belief. They accepted the prevailing Neoplatonic worldview and presented Christianity as its fulfillment, correcting and completing rather than replacing it. Philosophy, they thought, was to the Greeks what the Law was to the Jews—a preparation for the Gospel; and several Apologists agreed with the Jewish writer <xref refid="1773134" ty="1" topicid="456612" tocid="">Philo</xref> that Greek philosophy must have received much of its wisdom from <xref refid="1773135" ty="1" topicid="393555" tocid="">Moses</xref>. <xref refid="1773133" ty="1" topicid="588511" tocid="">Tertullian</xref> (<e>c.</e> 155/160–after 220)—who once asked, “What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?”—and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="584214" tocid="">Tatian</xref> (<e>c.</e> 120–173), on the other hand, rejected pagan learning and philosophy as inimical to the Gospel; and the question has been intermittently discussed by theologians ever since whether the Gospel completes and fulfills the findings of human reason or whether reason is itself so distorted by sin as to be incapable of leading toward the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Greek philosophy, then, provided the organizing principles by which the central Christian doctrines were formulated. It is possible to distinguish between, on the one hand, first-order religious expressions, directly reflecting primary religious experience, and, on the other, the interpretations of these in philosophically formulated doctrines whose articulation both contributes to and is reciprocally conditioned by a comprehensive belief-system. Thus the primitive Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131944" tocid="">confession of faith</xref>, “Jesus is Lord,” expressed the Disciples’ perception of Jesus as the one through whom God was transformingly present to them and to whom their lives were accordingly oriented in complete trust and commitment. The interpretive process whereby the original experience developed a comprehensive doctrinal superstructure began with the application to Jesus of the two distinctively Jewish concepts of the expected messiah and the Son of man who was to come on the last day and also of the son of God metaphor, which was commonly applied in the ancient world to individuals, whether kings or holy men, who were believed to be close to God. It continued on a more philosophical level with the use, in The Gospel According to John, of the idea of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="346460" tocid="">Logos</xref>, drawn both from the Hebraic notions of the Wisdom and the Word of God and from the Greek notion of the Logos as the universal principle of rationality and self-expression. As Jesus, son of God, became Christ, God the Son, the second Person of the Trinity, he was identified with the Logos.

                <p>
                  During the first several generations of Christian history there was great variety and experimentation in Christian thinking. But as the faith was legally recognized under Constantine in 313 and then became the sole official religion of the Roman Empire under Theodosius, its doctrines had to be formalized throughout the church. This pressure for uniformity provoked intense debates. The orthodox versions of the doctrine of Christ and the Trinity were finally established at the great ecumenical councils (principally Nicaea in 325; Constantinople in 381; and Chalcedon in 451). The key ideas of these Christological and Trinitarian debates and their conclusions were based upon the Greek concepts of ousia (nature or essence) and hypostasis (entity, used as virtually equivalent to <e>prosōpon</e>, person). (In Latin these terms became <e>substantia</e> and <e>persona</e>.) Christ was said to have two natures, one of which was of the same nature (<e>
                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="270595" tocid="">homoousios</xref>
                  </e>) as the Father, whereas the other was of the same nature as humanity; and the Trinity was said to consist of one ousia in three hypostases. The Platonic origin of this conceptuality is clear in the explanation of the Cappadocian Fathers that the Father, Son, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> share the same divine ousia in the way Peter, James, and John shared the same humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The influence of Neoplatonism on Christian thought also appears in the response of the greatest of the early Christian thinkers, <xref refid="1773137" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">St. Augustine</xref> (354–430), to the perennially challenging question of how it is that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="197324" tocid="">evil</xref> exists in a world created by an all-good and all-powerful God. Augustine’s answer (which, as refined by later thinkers, remained the standard Christian answer until modern times) includes both theological aspects (the ideas of the fall of angels and then of humans, of the redemption of some by the cross of Christ, and of the ultimate disposal of souls in eternities of bliss and torment) and philosophical aspects. The basic philosophical theme, drawn directly from Neoplatonism, is one that the American philosopher <xref refid="1773136" ty="1" topicid="349541" tocid="">Arthur Lovejoy</xref>, in <e>The Great Chain of Being</e> (1936), called the principle of plenitude. This is the idea that the best possible universe does not consist only of the highest kind of creature, the archangels, but contains a maximum richness of variety of modes of being, thus realizing every possible kind of existence from the highest to the lowest. The result is a hierarchy of degrees both of being and of goodness, for the identity of being and goodness was another fundamental idea Augustine inherited from Neoplatonism and in particular from <xref refid="1745890" ty="1" topicid="464926" tocid="">Plotinus</xref> (205–270). God, as absolute being and goodness, stands at the summit, with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="243044" tocid="">great chain of being</xref> descending through the many forms of spiritual, animal, and plant life down to lifeless matter. Each embodies being and is therefore good on its own level; and together they constitute a universe whose rich variety is beautiful in the sight of God. Evil occurs only when creatures at any level forfeit the distinctive goodness with which the Creator had endowed them. Evil is thus negative or privative, a lack of proper good rather than anything having substance in its own right. This, too, was a theme that had been taken over from Neoplatonism by a number of earlier Christian writers. And if evil is not an entity, or substance, it follows that it was not a part of God’s original creation. It consists instead in the going wrong of something that is in itself good, though also mutable. Augustine locates the origin of this going-wrong in the sinful misuse of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218436" tocid="">freedom</xref> by some of the angels and then by the first humans. His <xref refid="1773953" ty="1" topicid="590596" tocid="">theodicy</xref> is thus a blend of Neoplatonic and biblical themes and shows clearly the immense influence of Neoplatonism upon Christian thought during its early formative period.

                <p>
                  Augustine and Christian thinkers in general departed from Neoplatonism at one crucial point. Neoplatonism maintained that the world was continuous in being with the ultimate divine reality, the One. The One, in its limitless plenitude of being, overflows into the surrounding void, and the descending and attenuating degrees of being constitute the many-leveled universe. In contrast to this <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="185449" tocid="">emanationist</xref> conception Augustine held that the universe is a created realm, brought into existence by God out of nothing (<e>ex nihilo</e>). It has no independent power of being, or aseity, but is contingent, absolutely dependent upon the creative divine power. Further, Augustine emphasized that God did not create the universe out of preexistent matter or chaos, but that “out of nothing” simply means “not out of anything” (<e>De natura boni</e>). This understanding of creation, entailing the universe’s total emptiness of independent self-existence and yet its ultimate goodness as the free expression of God’s creative love, is perhaps the most distinctively Christian contribution to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="377923" tocid="">metaphysical</xref> thought. It goes beyond the earlier Hebraic understanding in making explicit the <e>ex nihilo</e> character of creation in contrast to the emanationism of the Neoplatonic thought-world. This basic Christian idea entails the value of creaturely life and of the material world itself, its dependence upon God, and the meaningfulness of the whole temporal process as fulfilling an ultimate divine purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern Christian treatments of the idea of creation <e>ex nihilo</e> have detached it from a literal use of the Genesis <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="142144" tocid="">creation myth</xref>. The idea of the total dependence of the universe upon God does not preclude the development of the universe in its present phase from the “<xref refid="1745891" ty="1" topicid="64893" tocid="">big bang</xref>” onward, including the evolution of the forms of life on Earth. Although creation<e> ex nihilo</e> (a term apparently first introduced into Christian discourse by <xref refid="1773957" ty="1" topicid="293911" tocid="">Irenaeus</xref> in the 2nd century) remains the general Christian conception of the relation between God and the physical universe, some 20th-century Christian thinkers substituted the view (derived from <xref refid="1773954" ty="1" topicid="642752" tocid="">Alfred North Whitehead</xref> and developed by <xref refid="1773955" ty="1" topicid="256219" tocid="">Charles Hartshorne</xref>) that God, instead of being its transcendent Creator, is an aspect of the universe itself, being either the inherent creativity in virtue of which it is a living process or a deity of finite power who seeks to lure the world into ever more valuable forms.

                  </thumbasm>Although Neoplatonism was the major philosophical influence on Christian thought in its early period and has never ceased to be an important element within it, <xref refid="1773958" ty="1" topicid="34511" tocid="">Aristotelianism</xref> also shaped Christian teachings. At first known for his works on logic, <xref refid="1773959" ty="1" topicid="34560" tocid="">Aristotle</xref> gained fuller appreciation in the 12th and 13th centuries when his works on physics, metaphysics, and ethics became available in Latin, translated either from the Greek or from Arabic sources. Aristotle’s thought had a profound impact on generations of medieval scholars and was crucial for the greatest of the medieval Christian thinkers, <xref refid="1773961" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">St. Thomas Aquinas</xref> (<e>c.</e> 1225–74). One of Aristotle’s ideas that particularly influenced Thomas was that knowledge is not innate but is gained from the reports of the senses and from logical inference from self-evident truths. (Thomas, however, in distinction from Aristotle, added divinely revealed propositions to self-evident truths in forming his basis for inference.) Thomas also adopted Aristotle’s conception of metaphysics as the science of being. His doctrine of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22465" tocid="">analogy</xref>, according to which statements about God are true analogically rather than univocally, was likewise inspired by Aristotle, as were his distinctions between act and potency, essence and existence, substance and accidents, and the active and passive intellect and his view of the soul as the “form” of the body.
                </p>
                <p>Thomas Aquinas’s system, however, was by no means simply Aristotle Christianized. He did not hesitate to differ from “the Philosopher,” as he called him, when the Christian tradition required this; for whereas Aristotle had been concerned to understand how the world functions, Thomas was also concerned, more fundamentally, to explain why it exists.</p>
                <p>
                  With the gradual breakdown of the medieval worldview, the nature of the philosophical enterprise began to change. The French thinker <xref refid="1773962" ty="1" topicid="158787" tocid="">René Descartes</xref> (1596–1650) is generally regarded as the father of modern philosophy, and in the new movements of thought that began with him philosophy became less a matter of building and defending comprehensive metaphysical systems, or imagined pictures of the universe, and more a critical probing of presuppositions, categories of thought, and modes of reasoning, as well as an inquiry into what it is to know, how knowledge and belief are arrived at in different areas of life, how well various kinds of beliefs are grounded, and how thought is related to language.
                </p>
                <p>There has long ceased to be a generally accepted philosophical framework, comparable with Neoplatonism, in terms of which Christianity can appropriately be expressed and defended. There is instead a plurality of philosophical perspectives and methods—analytic, phenomenological, idealist, pragmatist, and existentialist. Thus modern Christianity, having inherited a body of doctrines developed in the framework of ancient worldviews that are now virtually defunct, lacks any philosophy of comparable status in terms of which to rethink its beliefs.</p>
                <p>
                  In this situation some theologians turned to <xref refid="1745892" ty="1" topicid="198111" tocid="">existentialism</xref>, which is not so much a philosophical system as a hard-to-define point of view and style of thinking. Indeed, the earlier existentialists, such as the Danish philosopher <xref refid="1773964" ty="1" topicid="317503" tocid="">Søren Kierkegaard</xref> (1813–55), vehemently rejected the idea of a metaphysical system—in particular, for 19th-century existentialists, the Hegelian system—though some later ones, such as the German philosopher <xref refid="1773965" ty="1" topicid="259513" tocid="">Martin Heidegger</xref> (1889–1976), developed their own systems. Existentialists are identified by the appearance in their writings of one or more of a number of loosely related themes. These include the significance of the concrete individual in contrast to abstractions and general principles; a stress upon human freedom and choice and the centrality of decision, and hence a view of religion as ultimate commitment; a preference for paradox rather than rational explanation; and the highlighting of certain special modes of experience that cut across ordinary consciousness, particularly a generalized anxiety or dread and the haunting awareness of mortality. Existentialists have been both atheists (e.g., <xref refid="1773967" ty="1" topicid="414670" tocid="">Friedrich Nietzsche</xref> and <xref refid="1773968" ty="1" topicid="524547" tocid="">Jean-Paul Sartre</xref>) and Christians (e.g., Kierkegaard, the Protestant <xref refid="1773970" ty="1" topicid="84545" tocid="">Rudolf Bultmann</xref>, and the Roman Catholic <xref refid="1773971" ty="1" topicid="364105" tocid="">Gabriel Marcel</xref>). It would be difficult to identify any doctrines that are common to all these thinkers. Existentialist themes have also been incorporated into systematic Christian theologies (e.g., by John Macquarrie).

                  Others have sought to construct theologies in the mold of 19th-century German idealism (e.g., <xref refid="1773972" ty="1" topicid="595850" tocid="">Paul Tillich</xref>); some, as process theologians, in that of the early 20th-century British mathematician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead (e.g., Charles Hartshorne on the doctrine of God, John Cobb on Christology); some, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="339237" tocid="">liberation theologians</xref>, in highly pragmatic and political terms (e.g., Juan Luis Segundo, <xref refid="1773973" ty="1" topicid="249944" tocid="">Gustavo Gutiérrez</xref>); and some, as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="647122" tocid="">feminist</xref> theologians, in terms of the self-consciousness of women and the awareness of a distorting patriarchal influence on all past forms of Christian thought (e.g., Rosemary Ruether, Elizabeth Fiorenza). Most theologians, however, have continued to accept the traditional structure of Christian beliefs. The more liberal among them have sought to detach these from the older traditions and reformulate them so as to connect with modern consciousness (e.g., <xref refid="1773975" ty="1" topicid="527577" tocid="">Friedrich Schleiermacher</xref>, <xref refid="1773976" ty="1" topicid="504628" tocid="">Albrecht Ritschl</xref>, <xref refid="1773977" ty="1" topicid="255617" tocid="">Adolf von Harnack</xref>, <xref refid="1773978" ty="1" topicid="489663" tocid="">Karl Rahner</xref>, Gordon Kaufman); while the more conservative have sought to defend the traditional formulations within an increasingly alien intellectual environment (e.g., B.B.

The former have compelled the rethinking of certain Christian doctrines, as astronomy undermined the assumption of the centrality of the Earth in the universe, as geologic evidence concerning its age rendered implausible the biblical chronology, and as biology located humanity within the larger evolution of the forms of life on Earth. The human sciences of anthropology, psychology, sociology, and history have suggested possible naturalistic explanations of religion itself based, for example, upon the projection of desire for a cosmic father figure, the need for socially cohesive symbols, or the power of royal and priestly classes. Such naturalistic interpretations of religion, together with the ever-widening scientific understanding of the physical universe, have prompted some Christian philosophers to think of the religious ambiguity of the universe as a totality that can, from the human standpoint within it, be interpreted in both naturalistic and religious ways, thus providing scope for the exercise of faith as a free response to the mystery of existence.

              <p>
                Different conceptions of faith cohere with different views of its relation to reason or rationality. The classic medieval understanding of faith, set forth by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>, saw it as the belief in revealed truths on the authority of God as their ultimate source and guarantor. Thus, though the ultimate object of faith is God, its immediate object is the body of propositions articulating the basic Christian dogmas. Such faith is to be distinguished from knowledge. Whereas the propositions that are the objects of scientia, or knowledge, compel belief by their self-evidence or their demonstrability from self-evident premises, the propositions accepted by faith do not thus compel assent but require a voluntary act of trusting acceptance. As unforced belief, faith is “an act of the intellect assenting to the truth at the command of the will” (<e>
                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573302" tocid="">Summa theologiae</xref>
                </e>, II/II, Q. 4, art. 5); and it is because this is a free and responsible act that faith is one of the virtues. It follows that one cannot have knowledge and faith at the same time in relation to the same proposition; faith can only arise in the absence of knowledge. Faith also differs from mere opinion, which is inherently changeable. Opinions are not matters of absolute commitment but allow in principle for the possibility of doubt and change. Faith, as the wholehearted acceptance of revealed truth, excludes doubt.
              </p>
              <p>In the wider context of his philosophy, Aquinas held that human reason, without supernatural aid, can establish the existence of God and the immortality of the soul; for those who cannot or do not engage in such strenuous intellectual activity, however, these matters are also revealed and can be known by faith. Faith, though, extends beyond the findings of reason in accepting further truths such as the triune nature of God and the divinity of Christ. Aquinas thus supported the general (though not universal) Christian view that revelation supplements, rather than cancels or replaces, the findings of sound philosophy.</p>
              <p>From a skeptical point of view, which does not acknowledge divine revelation, this Thomist conception amounts to faith—belief that is without evidence or that is stronger than the evidence warrants, the gap being filled by the believer’s own will to believe. As such it attracts the charge that belief upon insufficient evidence is always irrational.</p>
              <p>
                In response to this kind of attack the French philosopher <xref refid="1773981" ty="1" topicid="445406" tocid="">Blaise Pascal</xref> (1623–62) proposed a voluntarist defense of faith as a rational wager. Pascal assumed, in disagreement with Thomas Aquinas but in agreement with much modern thinking, that divine existence can neither be proved nor disproved. He reasoned, therefore, that if one decides to believe in God and to act on this basis, one gains eternal life if right but loses little if wrong, whereas if one decides not to believe, one gains little if right but may lose eternal life if wrong, concluding that the rational course is to believe. The argument has been criticized theologically for presupposing an unacceptable image of God as rewarding such calculating worship and also on the philosophical ground that it is too permissive in that it could justify belief in the claims, however fantastic, of any person or group who threatened nonbelievers with damnation or other dangerous consequences.
              </p>
              <p>
                The American philosopher <xref refid="1773982" ty="1" topicid="299871" tocid="">William James</xref> (1842–1910) refined this approach by limiting it, among matters that cannot be proved, to belief-options that one has some real inclination or desire to accept, carry momentous implications, and are such that a failure to choose constitutes a negative choice. Theistic belief is for many people such an option, and James claimed that they have the right to make the positive decision to believe and to proceed in their lives on that basis. Either choice involves unavoidable risks: on the one hand the risk of being importantly deluded and on the other the risk of missing a limitlessly valuable truth. In this situation each individual is entitled to decide which risk to run. This argument has also been criticized as being too permissive and as constituting in effect a license for wishful believing, but its basic principle can perhaps be validly used in the context of basing beliefs upon one’s religious experience.
              </p>
              <p>The element of risk in faith as a free cognitive choice was emphasized, to the exclusion of all else, by Kierkegaard in his idea of the leap of faith. He believed that without risk there is no faith, and that the greater the risk the greater the faith. Faith is thus a passionate commitment, not based upon reason but inwardly necessitated, to that which can be grasped in no other way.</p>
              <p>
                The epistemological character of faith as assent to propositions, basic to the Thomist account, is less pronounced in the conceptions of Pascal and James in that these accept not a system of doctrines but only the thought of God as existing, which itself has conceptual and implicitly propositional content. Kierkegaard’s self-constituting leap of faith likewise only implicitly involves conceptual and propositional thought, as does the account of faith based upon <xref refid="1773983" ty="1" topicid="646252" tocid="">Ludwig Wittgenstein</xref>’s concept of seeing-as (<e>Philosophical Investigations</e>, 1953). Wittgenstein pointed to the epistemological significance of puzzle pictures, such as the ambiguous “duck-rabbit” that can be seen either as a duck’s head facing one way or a rabbit’s head facing another way. The enlarged concept of experiencing-as (developed by the British philosopher John Hick) refers to the way in which an object, event, or situation is experienced as having a particular character or meaning such that to experience it in this manner involves being in a dispositional state to behave in relation to the object or event, or within the situation, in ways that are appropriate to its having that particular character. All conscious experience is in this sense experiencing-as. The application of this idea to religion suggests that the total environment is religiously ambiguous, capable of being experienced in both religious and naturalistic ways. Religious faith is the element of uncompelled interpretation within the distinctively religious ways of experiencing—for <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590421" tocid="">theism</xref>, experiencing the world or events in history or in one’s own life as mediating the presence and activity of God. In ancient Hebrew history, for example, events that are described by secular historians as the effects of political and economic forces were experienced by the prophets as occasions in which God was saving or punishing, rewarding or testing, the Israelites. In such cases, religious experiencing-as does not replace secular experiencing-as but supervenes upon it, revealing a further order of meaning in the events of the world. And the often unconscious cognitive choice whereby someone experiences religiously constitutes, on this view, faith in its most epistemologically basic sense.
              </p>
              <p>For these voluntarist, existentialist, and experiential conceptions of faith the place of reason in religion, although important, is secondary. Reason cannot directly establish the truth of religious propositions, but it can defend the propriety of trusting one’s deeper intuitions or one’s religious experience and basing one’s beliefs and life upon them. These schools of thought assume that the philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God are inconclusive, and that the universe is capable of being consistently thought of and experienced in both religious and naturalistic ways. This assumption, however, runs counter to the long tradition of natural theology.</p>

                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">St. Paul</xref>, and many others in the Greco-Roman world, believed that the existence of God is evident from the appearances of nature: “Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made” (Romans 1:20). The most popular, because the most accessible, of the theistic arguments is that which infers a divine designer from perceived evidence of design in nature. The argument, propounded by medieval Christian thinkers, was developed in great detail in 17th- and 18th-century Europe by writers such as <xref refid="1773988" ty="1" topicid="76496" tocid="">Robert Boyle</xref>, <xref refid="1773994" ty="1" topicid="492392" tocid="">John Ray</xref>, <xref refid="1773992" ty="1" topicid="120039" tocid="">Samuel Clarke</xref>, and William Derham and at the beginning of the 19th century by <xref refid="1773986" ty="1" topicid="439805" tocid="">William Paley</xref>. They asked: Is not the eye as manifestly designed for seeing, and the ear for hearing, as a pen for writing or a clock for telling the time; and does not such design imply a designer? The belief that the universe is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it.

                    The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="585934" tocid="">argument from design</xref> was criticized by the Scottish philosopher <xref refid="1773989" ty="1" topicid="276139" tocid="">David Hume</xref> in his <e>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</e> (1779). Hume conceded that the world constitutes a more or less smoothly functioning system; indeed, he points out, it could not exist otherwise. He suggests, however, that this may have come about as a result of the chance permutations of particles falling into a temporary or permanent self-sustaining order, which thus has the appearance of design. A century later the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by <xref refid="1773995" ty="1" topicid="151902" tocid="">Charles Darwin</xref>’s discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life are a result of the <xref refid="1773996" ty="1" topicid="406351" tocid="">natural selection</xref> of inherited characteristics having positive, and the elimination of those having negative, survival value within a changing environment. Hume also pointed out that, even if one could infer an <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1081911" tocid="">intelligent designer</xref> of the world, one would not thereby be entitled to claim that such a designer is the infinitely good and powerful Creator who is the object of Christian faith. For the world is apparently imperfect, containing many inbuilt occasions of pain and suffering, and one cannot legitimately infer a greater perfection in the cause than is observed in the effect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the 20th century, however, the design argument was reformulated in more comprehensive ways, particularly by the British philosophers <xref refid="1773997" ty="1" topicid="587300" tocid="">Frederick R. Tennant</xref> (<e>Philosophical Theology</e>, 1928–30) and Richard Swinburne (using Thomas Bayes’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477493" tocid="">probability</xref> theorem in <e>The Existence of God</e>, 1979), taking account not only of the order and functioning of nature but also of the “fit” between human intelligence and the universe, whereby humans can understand its workings, as well as human aesthetic, moral, and religious experience. There were also attempts to show that the evolution of the universe, from the “big bang” of 13.8 billion years ago to the present state that includes conscious life, required the conjunction of so many individually improbable factors as to be inexplicable except as the result of a deliberate coordinating control. If, for example, the initial heat of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="198347" tocid="">expanding universe</xref>, or its total mass, or the strength of the force of gravity, or the mass of neutrinos, or the strength of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="569442" tocid="">strong nuclear force</xref>, had been different by a small margin, there would have been no galaxies, no stars, no planets, and hence no life. Surely, it was argued, all this must be the work of God creating the conditions for human existence.

                    These probability arguments were, however, strongly criticized. A basic consideration relevant to them all is that there is by definition only one universe, and it is difficult to see how its existence, either with or without God, can be assessed as having a specific degree of probability in any objective sense. It can of course be said that any form in which the universe might be is statistically enormously improbable, as it is only one of a virtual infinity of possible forms. But its actual form is no more improbable, in this sense, than innumerable others. It is only the fact that humans are part of it that makes it seem so special, requiring a transcendent explanation. Debate about the design argument continued through the late 20th and early 21st centuries, particularly in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref> (<e>see also</e> <xref refid="1759102" ty="1" topicid="1081911" tocid="">intelligent design</xref>).

                    Aquinas gave the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="208087" tocid="">first-cause</xref> argument and the argument from contingency—both forms of cosmological reasoning—a central place for many centuries in the Christian enterprise of natural theology. (Similar arguments also appeared in parallel strands of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295736" tocid="">Islamic philosophy</xref>.) Thomas’s formulations (<e>Summa theologiae</e>, I, Q. 2, art. 3) were refined in modern neo-Thomist discussions and remained topics of Christian philosophical reflection during the 20th century.

                  <p>
                    The first-cause argument begins with the assumption that there is change in the world. Change is always the effect of some cause or causes. Each cause is itself the effect of a further cause or set of causes; this chain moves in a series that either never ends or is completed by a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="208087" tocid="">first cause</xref>, which must be of a radically different nature in that it is not itself caused. Such a first cause is an important aspect, though not the entirety, of what Christianity means by God.
                  </p>
                  <p>Although taking a different route, the argument from contingency follows the same basic movement of thought from the nature of the world to its ultimate ground. It starts with the premise that everything in the world is contingent for its existence upon other factors. Its presence is thus not self-explanatory but can only be understood by reference beyond itself to prior or wider circumstances that have brought it about. These other circumstances are also contingent, pointing beyond themselves for the ground of their intelligibility. If this explanatory regress is unending, explanation is perpetually postponed and nothing is finally explained. The existence of anything and everything thus remains ultimately unintelligible. But rational beings are committed to the search for intelligibility and cannot rest content until it is found. The universe can only finally be intelligible as the creation of an ontologically necessary being who is eternal and whose existence is not contingent upon anything else. This is also part of what Christianity has meant by God.</p>
                  <p>
                    Criticism of these arguments points to the possibility that there is no first cause because the universe had no beginning, having existed throughout time, and is itself the necessary being that has existed eternally and without dependence upon anything else. Proponents of the cosmological argument reply that the existence of such a universe, as a procession of contingent events without beginning, would still be ultimately unintelligible. On the other hand, a personal consciousness and will, constituting a self-existent Creator of the universe, would be intrinsically intelligible; for <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> have experience in themselves of intelligence and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218436" tocid="">free will</xref> as creative. Critics respond that insofar as the argument is sound it leaves one with the choice between believing that the universe is ultimately intelligible, because created by a self-existent personal will, or accepting that it is finally unintelligible, simply the ultimate given brute fact. The cosmological argument does not, however, compel one to choose the first alternative; logically, the second remains equally possible.

                    </thumbasm>The ontological argument, which proceeds not from the world to its Creator but from the idea of God to the reality of God, was first clearly formulated by <xref refid="1773999" ty="1" topicid="26753" tocid="">St. Anselm</xref> (1033/34–1109) in his <e>Proslogion</e> (1077–78). Anselm began with the concept of God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived (<e>aliquid quo nihil majus cogitari possit</e>). To think of such a being as existing only in thought and not also in reality involves a contradiction. For an X that lacks real existence is not that than which no greater can be conceived. A yet greater being would be X with the further attribute of existence. Thus the unsurpassably perfect being must exist—otherwise it would not be unsurpassably perfect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This argument has intrigued philosophers ever since. After some discussion in the 13th century it was reformulated by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="158787" tocid="">Descartes</xref> in his <e>Meditations</e> (1641). Descartes made explicit the assumption, implicit in Anselm’s reasoning, that existence is an attribute that a given X can have or fail to have. It follows from this—together with the assumption that existence is an attribute that is better to have than to lack—that God, as unsurpassably perfect, cannot lack the attribute of existence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was the assumption that existence is a predicate that has, in the view of most subsequent philosophers, proved fatal to the argument. The criticism was first made by Descartes’s contemporary <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="226651" tocid="">Pierre Gassendi</xref> and later and more prominently by the German philosopher <xref refid="1774000" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Immanuel Kant</xref> (1724–1804) in his <e>Critique of Pure Reason</e> (1781). <xref refid="1774001" ty="1" topicid="513124" tocid="">Bertrand Russell</xref> and others in the 20th century further clarified this objection. According to Russell, to say that something with stated properties—whether it be a triangle, defined as a three-sided plane figure, or God, defined as an unsurpassably perfect being—exists is not to attribute to it a further property, namely existence, but to assert that the concept is instantiated—that there actually are instances of that concept. But whether or not a given concept is instantiated is a question of fact. It cannot be determined a priori but only by whatever is the appropriate method for discovering a fact of that kind. This need for observation cannot be circumvented by writing existence into the definition of the concept (“an existing three-sided plane figure,” “an existing unsurpassably perfect being”), for the need arises again as the question of whether this enlarged concept is instantiated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the 20th century several Christian philosophers (notably <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="256219" tocid="">Charles Hartshorne</xref>, Norman Malcolm, and Alvin Plantinga) asserted the validity of a second form of Anselm’s argument. This hinges upon “necessary existence,” a property with even higher value than “existence.” A being that necessarily exists cannot coherently be thought not to exist. And so God, as the unsurpassably perfect being, must have necessary existence—and therefore must exist. This argument, however, has been criticized as failing to observe the distinction between logical and ontological, or factual, necessity. Logically necessary existence, it is said, is an incoherent idea, for logical necessity applies to the relations between concepts, not to their instantiation. God’s necessity, then, must be an ontologically, or factually, rather than a logically, necessary existence: God exists as the ultimate fact, without beginning or end and without depending upon anything else for existence. But whether this concept of an ontologically necessary being is instantiated cannot be determined a priori. It cannot be validly inferred from the idea of an eternal and independent being that there actually is such a being.

                  <p>
                    Moral theistic argument belongs primarily to the modern world and perhaps reflects the modern lack of confidence in metaphysical constructions. Kant, having rejected the cosmological, ontological, and design proofs, argued in the <e>Critique of Practical Reason</e> (1788) that the existence of God, though not directly provable, is a necessary postulate of the moral life. To take seriously the awareness of a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99359" tocid="">categorical imperative</xref> to act rightly is to commit oneself to work for an ideal state of affairs in which perfect goodness and happiness coincide. But as this universal apportioning of happiness to virtue is beyond human power, a divine agent capable of bringing it about must be assumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>Other Christian thinkers, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, argued that to accept the absolute demands of ethical obligation is to presuppose a morally structured universe, which implies a personal God whose commands are reflected in the human conscience. It cannot be proved that this is such a universe, but it is inevitably assumed in acknowledging the claims of morality.</p>
                  <p>Attempts to trace ethical obligation to a transcendent divine source have been criticized on the grounds that it is possible to account for morality without going beyond the human realm. It has been argued that the exigencies of communal life require agreed codes of behaviour, which become internalized in the process of socialization as moral laws; and the natural affection that develops among humans produces the more occasional sense of a call to heroic self-sacrifice on behalf of others.</p>

                    Religious experience is used in Christian apologetics in two ways—in the argument from religious experiences to God as their cause and in the claim that it is (in the absence of contrary indications) as reasonable to trust religious as it is to trust nonreligious experience in forming beliefs about the total environment. (The first use is considered here; for the second, <e>see below</e> <xref refid="19546" ty="3" topicid="115240" tocid="67544">Contemporary discussions</xref>.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The argument maintains that special episodes, such as seeing visions of Christ or Mary or hearing the voice of God, as well as the more pervasive experience of “living in God’s presence” or of “absolute dependence upon a higher power,” constitute evidence of God as their source. Although such experiences may be accepted as having occurred, their cause, as critics have noted, might be purely natural. To establish that the experiences are real, as experiences, is not to establish that they are caused by an infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, divine being. As <xref refid="1774002" ty="1" topicid="268448" tocid="">Thomas Hobbes</xref> succinctly put it, when someone says that God has spoken to him in a dream, this “is no more than to say he dreamed that God spake to him” (<e>Leviathan</e>, Pt. III, ch. 32).
                  </p>
                  <p>The analogous argument, from miracles to God as their cause, is more complex and involves two sets of problems. The argument may assert that the children of Israel were miraculously rescued from Egypt or Jesus was miraculously raised from the dead and therefore that God must exist as the agent of these miracles. The first problem concerns the reports. Whereas in the case of private religious experiences the skeptic (to whom the argument is addressed) may well be willing to grant that such experiences occurred, in the case of public miracles the skeptic will require adequate evidence for the described event; and this is not forthcoming for the classic miracle stories referring to alleged extraordinary events of many centuries ago. There are, however, well-evidenced contemporary and recent accounts of “miraculous” healings and other remarkable happenings. On the assumption that some of these, and also some of the classic miracle stories, are historically accurate, the second problem arises. How can it be established that these events were caused by divine intervention rather than by the operation of natural phenomena?</p>
                  <p>Once again, strict proof seems to be lacking. These arguments, however, display aspects of the explanatory power of the idea of God. Divine activity is not the only possible way of understanding the character of the universe, its contingent existence, the unconditional claims of morality, or the occurrence of religious experiences and “miracles.” Nevertheless, the concept of deity offers a possible, satisfying answer to the fundamental questions to which these various factors point. These questions may thus be said to open the door to rational theistic belief—while still leaving the nonbeliever waiting for a positive impetus to go through that door. The work of some contemporary Christian philosophers can be characterized as a search for such a positive impetus.</p>

                  Human beings seem always to have had some notion of a shadowy double that survives the death of the body. But the idea of the soul as a mental entity, with intellectual and moral qualities, interacting with a physical organism but capable of continuing after its dissolution, derives in Western thought from <xref refid="1774013" ty="1" topicid="464109" tocid="">Plato</xref> and entered into <xref refid="1774011" ty="1" topicid="307197" tocid="">Judaism</xref> during approximately the last century before the Common Era and thence into Christianity. In Jewish and Christian thinking it has existed in tension with the idea of the resurrection of the person conceived as an indissoluble psychophysical unity. Christian thought gradually settled into a pattern that required both of these apparently divergent ideas. At death the soul is separated from the body and exists in a conscious or unconscious disembodied state. But on the future Day of Judgment souls will be re-embodied (whether in their former but now transfigured earthly bodies or in new resurrection bodies) and will live eternally in the heavenly kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within this framework, philosophical discussion has centred mainly on the idea of the immaterial soul and its capacity to survive the death of the body. Plato, in the <e>Phaedo</e>, argued that the soul is inherently indestructible. To destroy something, including the body, is to disintegrate it into its constituent elements; but the soul, as a mental entity, is not composed of parts and is thus an indissoluble unity. Although <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Aquinas</xref>’s concept of the soul, as the “form” of the body, was derived from Aristotle rather than Plato, Aquinas too argued for its indestructibility (<e>Summa theologiae</e>, I, Q. 76, art. 6). The French philosopher <xref refid="1774017" ty="1" topicid="365487" tocid="">Jacques Maritain</xref> (1882–1973), a modern <xref refid="1774018" ty="1" topicid="592919" tocid="">Thomist</xref>, summarized the conclusion as follows: “A spiritual soul cannot be corrupted, since it possesses no matter; it cannot be disintegrated, since it has no substantial parts; it cannot lose its individual unity, since it is self-subsisting, nor its <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="290532" tocid="">internal energy</xref> since it contains within itself all the sources of its energies” (<e>The Range of Reason</e>, 1952). But though it is possible to define the soul in such a way that it is incorruptible, indissoluble, and self-subsisting, critics have asked whether there is any good reason to think that souls as thus defined exist. If, on the other hand, the soul means the conscious mind or personality—something whose immortality would be of great interest to human beings—this does not seem to be an indissoluble unity. On the contrary, it seems to have a kind of organic unity that can vary in degree but that is also capable of fragmentation and dissolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much modern philosophical analysis of the concept of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="383523" tocid="">mind</xref> is inhospitable to the idea of immortality, for it equates mental life with the functioning of the physical brain (<e>see</e> <xref refid="19547" ty="1" topicid="383556" tocid="">mind, philosophy of</xref>). Impressed by evidence of the dependence of mind on brain, some Christian thinkers have been willing to accept the view—corresponding to the ancient Hebrew understanding—of the human being as an indissoluble psychophysical unity, but these thinkers have still maintained a belief in immortality, not as the mind surviving the body, but as a divine resurrection or re-creation of the living body-mind totality. Such resurrection persons would presumably be located in a space different from that which they now inhabit and would presumably undergo a development from the condition of a dying person to that of a viable inhabitant of the resurrection world. But all theories in this area have their own difficulties, and alternative theories emerged.

                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Kant</xref> offered a different kind of argument for immortality—as a postulate of the moral life. The claim of the moral law demands that human beings become perfect. This is something that can never be finally achieved but only asymptotically approached, and such an unending approach requires the unending existence of the soul. This argument also is open to criticism. Are humans indeed subject to a strict obligation to attain moral perfection? Might not their obligation, as finite creatures, be to do the best they can? But this does not seem to entail immortality.
                </p>
                <p>It should be noted that the debate concerning arguments about the immortality of the soul and the existence of God has been as much among Christian philosophers as between them and non-Christian thinkers. It is by no means the case that Christian thinkers have all regarded the project of natural theology as viable. There have indeed been, and are, many who hold that divine existence can be definitively proved or shown to be objectively probable. But many others not only hold that the attempted proofs all require premises that a disbeliever is under no rational obligation to accept but also question the evidentialist assumption that the only route to rational theistic belief is by inference from previously accepted evidence-stating premises.</p>

                Discussion among Christian philosophers during the 20th century was predominantly <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="190219" tocid="">epistemological</xref>. Among <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic</xref> thinkers it included the work of Bernard Lonergan in <e>Insight</e> (1957), which has stimulated considerable discussion.

Other Roman Catholic thinkers refined and extended the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="592919" tocid="">Thomistic</xref> approach, particularly the idea of analogical predication in statements about God. Others, in common with non-Catholic philosophers, have discussed the traditional divine attributes—omniscience, omnipotence, eternity, immutability, personality, goodness. The concept of a finite deity developing through time was also proposed (e.g., by Charles Hartshorne) to meet objections to some of these concepts: If God is immutable, how can God be aware of successive events in time? If God has absolute self-existence, how can God respond with sympathy to the pains of creaturely life? Others defended the traditional attributes as logically coherent, both individually and in their relationship to one another, and as allowing for divine awareness of the created universe, God’s activity in history, and divine sympathy with human suffering.

                <p>
                  Perhaps the largest body of work, however, was generated in dialogue with the linguistic turn of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22568" tocid="">philosophy</xref> in the English-speaking world, concentrating on the analysis of language in its various uses. The <xref refid="1774025" ty="1" topicid="346336" tocid="">logical positivist</xref> movement originated in the 1920s with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="628166" tocid="">Vienna Circle</xref>. Although mainly concerned with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="528804" tocid="">philosophy of science</xref>, it posed by implication a major challenge to the logical meaningfulness of religious language. The positivist position, in its developed form, was that a statement has factual meaning only if it is capable in principle of being <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="626091" tocid="">verified</xref> or falsified, or at least in some degree confirmed or disconfirmed, within human experience; otherwise it is meaningless, or cognitively vacuous. In the years immediately after <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648813" tocid="">World War II</xref> this account of factual meaning was applied (e.g., by Antony Flew) to theological statements, raising such questions as: What observable difference does it make whether it is true or false that “God loves us”? Whatever tragedies occur, do not the faithful still maintain their belief, adding perhaps that the divine love is beyond human comprehension? But if it is not possible to conceive of circumstances in which “God loves us” would have to be judged false, is not the statement factually empty, or meaningless?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This challenge evoked three kinds of response. Some Christian philosophers declared it to be a nonchallenge, on the ground that the positivists never succeeded in finding a precise formulation of the verification criterion that was fully satisfactory even to themselves. Others held that this does not block the central thrust of the positivist challenge. Does it really make no difference within actual or possible human experience whether or not God exists and loves us; and if so, is not the significance of the belief thereby fatally damaged? Among those who felt it necessary to face this challenge, one group granted that theological statements lack factual meaning and suggested that their proper use lies elsewhere, as expressing a way of looking at the world (e.g., Richard M. Hare) or a moral point of view and commitment (e.g., <xref refid="1774028" ty="1" topicid="77429" tocid="">R.B. Braithwaite</xref>). The other group claimed that theism is ultimately open to experiential confirmation. The theory of eschatological verification (developed by John Hick) holds that the belief in future postmortem experiences will be verified if true (though not falsified if false), and that in a divinely governed universe such experiences will take forms confirming theistic faith. Thus although the believer and the disbeliever do not have different expectations about the course of earthly history, they do expect the total course of the universe to be radically different.

                <p>
                  In the late 20th century, under the stimulus of Wittgenstein’s posthumously published works, attention was directed to the multiple legitimate uses of language in the various language games developed within different human activities and forms of life; and it was suggested that religious belief has its own autonomous validity, not subject to verificationist or scientific or other extraneous criteria. Statements about God and eternal life do not make true-or-false factual claims but express, in religious language, a distinctive attitude to life and way of engaging in it. This suggestion formed part of the broader non-realist interpretation of religion, which held that religious beliefs do not refer to putative transcendent realities but are instead expressive of human ideals, desires, hopes, attitudes, and intentions. Such thinking goes back to the German philosopher <xref refid="1774033" ty="1" topicid="205641" tocid="">Ludwig Feuerbach</xref> (<e>The Essence of Christianity</e>, 1841) in the 19th century.

Randall, Jr.</xref>, and later by Christian writers such as D.Z. Phillips and Don Cupitt. According to them, true Christianity consists in the inner purity of an unself-centred attitude to life and does not involve belief in the objective reality of God or of a life after death. This view, however, was criticized on the grounds that to deny the transcendent reference of religious language empties it of any substantial meaning.

                <headtitle>Evidentialist approach</headtitle>
                <p>
                  In addition to this and other work concerning religious language there was a renewal of fundamental discussion of Christian, and more broadly religious, epistemology. The natural theology tradition held that, in order to be rational, religious belief must be supported by adequate evidences or arguments. It was assumed that God’s existence must be validly inferred from generally acceptable premises. This evidentialist principle was questioned, however, not only by such earlier thinkers as <xref refid="1775780" ty="1" topicid="445406" tocid="">Pascal</xref> and <xref refid="1775781" ty="1" topicid="299871" tocid="">William James</xref> but also by a number of Christian philosophers of the second half of the 20th century. Evidentialist thinking was foundationalist in granting that there are some beliefs that can be reasonably held directly and not by inference from other evidence-stating beliefs. Thomas Aquinas, for example, recognized self-evident truths and the reports of the senses as basic in the sense that they do not need support from other beliefs. They thus provide the foundations on which a belief structure can properly be built. Belief in the existence of God was not regarded as basic or foundational in this way but was thought to require adequate evidence or arguments. It was argued by Alvin Plantinga that the range of properly basic beliefs is wider than classic foundationalism recognized. It can include not only beliefs about the past and the existence of other persons but also belief in the reality of God. Such beliefs can be basic (i.e., not inferred), and they are properly basic if held in appropriate circumstances. Thus, the belief that “There is a tree before me” is properly basic for one who is having the experience of seeing a tree; and the belief that “God exists” is properly basic for one who experiences God’s judgment, forgiveness, love, claim, providential care, or some other mode of divine presence.
                </p>
                <p>Discussion of this proposal centred upon the criteria for proper basicality: In what circumstances is it appropriate, and in what circumstances not, to hold the basic belief in God or the basic beliefs of other religions or of the naturalistic worldviews?</p>
                <p>
                  A related contemporary development, pursued by William Alston and others, is the claim that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497327" tocid="">religious experience</xref> constitutes an entirely proper basis for religious beliefs. The claim is not that one can validly infer God as the cause of theistic religious experience, but that one who participates in such experience is entitled to trust it as a ground for belief. It was argued that human beings all normally operate with a “principle of credulity” whereby they take what seems to be so as indeed so, unless they have some positive reason to doubt it. Accordingly, one who has the experience of living in the presence of God can properly proceed in both thought and life on the basis that God is real. Such belief inevitably involves epistemic risk—the risk of error versus the risk of missing the truth. But perhaps the right to believe that was defended by William James applies in this situation.
                </p>
                <p>The discussion focused on the analogies between religious experience and sensory experience in relation to which the principle of credulity is virtually universally accepted. It is uncontroversially proper to hold beliefs reflecting sense experience, but what of beliefs reflecting religious experience? Whereas all human beings hold the former and could not survive without doing so, the latter type of belief seems to be optional. Although beliefs regarding physical objects can be empirically confirmed or denied, religious beliefs cannot. Acknowledging these differences, some Christian philosophers argued that they are to be expected, given the difference between the human relationship to the world and to God. It is necessary to human existence as physical organisms that consciousness of the material environment should be forced upon human beings. On the other hand, it is necessary for existence as relatively autonomous and responsible beings that consciousness of God should not be forced upon them, for to be compulsorily aware of God’s universal presence as limitless goodness and power, making a total claim upon human life, would deprive them of creaturely freedom. Humans are accordingly set at an epistemic distance from God that is overcome only by faith, which can be identified with the voluntary interpretive element within the experience of God’s presence.</p>
                <p>
                  The central Christian doctrine of the divinity of Christ was another topic of discussion in the later 20th century. Philosophical questions concerning this topic were debated in the 3rd to 5th centuries, as noted above, in terms of the key notion of ousia/substantia. The concept of substance, however, although confidently used throughout the medieval period, was widely questioned by modern thinkers and found little place in distinctively 20th-century streams of philosophy. Consequently, there was a variety of attempts, in which theology and philosophy mingled inextricably, to find an interpretation that would be intelligible to the modern mind. Instead of the basically static notion of substance—Jesus qua human being of human substance and qua divine of God’s substance—many have preferred the more dynamic idea of divine action. From this point of view Jesus was divine in the sense that God was acting redemptively through him; or, instead of a <e>homo-ousion</e>, identity of substance, between Jesus and the heavenly Father, there was a <e>homo-agapion</e>, an identity of divine loving. Others, however, criticized such alternatives to the older substance language, often on the ground that, whereas “being of the same substance as” is an all-or-nothing concept, divine activity in and through a human life is capable of degrees, so that the divinity of Christ may in principle be de-absolutized.
                </p>
                <p>The problems of religious pluralism were increasingly seen as requiring the attention of Christian philosophers. One reason arises from the kind of apologetic described above, hinging upon the reasonableness of basing beliefs upon religious experience. There is considerable variety within the Christian tradition itself, and in the world as a whole Muslim forms of religious experience give rise to and justify Islamic beliefs, Jewish forms of experience to Jewish beliefs, Hindu to Hindu beliefs, Buddhist to Buddhist beliefs, and so on. These different belief systems include mutually incompatible doctrines. Thus the experiential solution to the problem of justifying Christian beliefs gave rise to a new problem constituted by the conflicting truth-claims of the different religious traditions.</p>
                <p>
                  The other reason the great world faiths provided new issues for Christian philosophy was that some of their belief systems challenge long-standing Christian assumptions. Whereas Judaism and Islam raise theological questions, the most challenging philosophical issues are raised by <xref refid="1775784" ty="1" topicid="83184" tocid="">Buddhism</xref>. The belief in God as the personal ultimate is challenged by the idea of the ultimacy of the nonpersonal <e>dharma-kaya</e>. The idea of the immortal soul is challenged by the <e>
                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="23116" tocid="">anatta</xref>
                  </e> (“no soul”) doctrine, with its claim that the personal mind or soul is not an enduring substance but a succession of fleeting moments of consciousness. And yet Buddhism, teaching as it does doctrines that are radically different from those of the Christian faith, also challenges Christianity by the centrality within it of compassion, peaceableness, and a respect for all life.
                </p>
                <p>These and other issues raised by the fact of religious plurality are ones that Christian philosophers have only begun to face but that suggest the possibility of major developments in Christian thinking.</p>

              <xref refid="1775785" ty="1" topicid="400861" tocid="">Mysticism</xref> is the sense of some form of contact with the divine or transcendent, frequently understood in its higher forms as involving union with God. Mysticism played an important role in the history of Christian religion and emerged as a living influence in modern times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scholars have studied mysticism from many perspectives, including the psychological, comparativist, philosophical, and theological. Hermeneutical and deconstructionist philosophies in the 20th century brought increasing attention to the mystical text. Among the theoretical questions that have been much debated are issues such as whether mysticism constitutes the core or essence of personal religion or whether it is better viewed as one element interacting with others in the formation of concrete religions. Those who emphasize a strong distinction between mystical experience and subsequent interpretation generally seek out a common core of all mysticism; others insist that experience and interpretation cannot be so easily sundered and that mysticism is in most cases tied to a specific religion and contingent upon its teachings. Both those who search for the common core, such as the British philosopher <xref refid="1775787" ty="1" topicid="562280" tocid="">Walter T. Stace</xref>, and those who emphasize the differences among forms of mysticism, such as the British historian of religion <xref refid="1775786" ty="1" topicid="655309" tocid="">Robert C. Zaehner</xref>, have employed typologies of mysticism, often based on the contrast between introvertive and extrovertive mysticism developed by the comparativist <xref refid="1775788" ty="1" topicid="434884" tocid="">Rudolf Otto</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cognitive status of mystical knowing and its clash with the mystics’ claims about the ineffability of their experiences have also been topics of interest for modern students of mysticism. Among the most important investigations of mystical knowing are those of the Belgian Jesuit Joseph Maréchal and the French philosophers <xref refid="1775789" ty="1" topicid="61856" tocid="">Henri Bergson</xref> and <xref refid="1775790" ty="1" topicid="365487" tocid="">Jacques Maritain</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The relation between mysticism and morality has been a topic of scholarly debate since the time of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="299871" tocid="">William James</xref>, but certain questions have concerned Christian mystics for centuries. Does mystical experience always confirm traditional religious ideas about right and wrong, or is mysticism independent of moral issues? Although the problems regarding mysticism are fairly easy to identify, their solutions seem far off.
            </p>
            <p>
              The role of mysticism in Christianity has been variously evaluated by modern theologians. Many <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479892" tocid="">Protestant</xref> thinkers, from <xref refid="1775791" ty="1" topicid="504628" tocid="">Albrecht Ritschl</xref> and <xref refid="1775795" ty="1" topicid="255617" tocid="">Adolf von Harnack</xref> through <xref refid="1775793" ty="1" topicid="54311" tocid="">Karl Barth</xref> and <xref refid="1775794" ty="1" topicid="84545" tocid="">Rudolf Bultmann</xref>, have denied mysticism an integral role in Christianity, claiming that mystical union was an import from Greek thought that is incompatible with saving faith in the Gospel word. Other Protestant theologians, such as <xref refid="1775797" ty="1" topicid="606217" tocid="">Ernst Troeltsch</xref> in <e>The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches</e> (trans. 1931) and <xref refid="1775796" ty="1" topicid="528657" tocid="">Albert Schweitzer</xref> in <e>

            </p>
            <p>
              The most extensive theological discussions of mysticism in Christianity have been found in modern <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholicism</xref>. In the first half of the 20th century Neoscholastic authors—invoking the authority of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref> and the Spanish mystics <xref refid="1775804" ty="1" topicid="587885" tocid="">Teresa of Ávila</xref> and <xref refid="1775803" ty="1" topicid="305126" tocid="">John of the Cross</xref>—debated whether mystical contemplation was the goal of all Christians or a special grace offered only to a few. The discrimination of the various forms of prayer and the distinction between acquired contemplation, for which the believer could strive with the help of grace, and infused contemplation, which was a pure and unmerited gift, framed much of this discussion. Other Roman Catholic theologians, such as Cuthbert Butler in <e>Western Mysticism</e> (1922) and Anselm Stolz in <e>Theologie der Mystik</e> (1936), broke with Neoscholasticism to consider the wider scriptural and patristic tradition. In the second half of the century Roman Catholic theologians including <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="489663" tocid="">Karl Rahner</xref> and Hans Urs von Balthasar addressed key theological issues in mysticism, such as the relation of mystical experience to the universal offer of grace and the status of non-Christian mysticism, and Pope <xref refid="1775805" ty="1" topicid="305139" tocid="">John Paul II</xref>, whose devotion to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367422" tocid="">Virgin Mary</xref> was mystical, expressed profound admiration for the works of John of the Cross.

                <p>
                  Although the essence of mysticism is the sense of contact with the transcendent, mysticism in the history of Christianity should not be understood merely in terms of special ecstatic experiences but as part of a religious process lived out within the Christian community. From this perspective mysticism played a vital part in the early church. Early Christianity was a religion of the spirit that expressed itself in the heightening and enlargement of human consciousness. It is clear from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578522" tocid="">Synoptic Gospels</xref> (e.g., Matthew 11:25–27) that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus</xref> was thought to have enjoyed a sense of special contact with God. In the primitive church an active part was played by prophets, who were believed to be recipients of a revelation coming directly from the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mystical aspect of early Christianity finds its fullest expression, however, in the letters of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> and The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref>. For Paul and John, mystical experience and aspiration are always for union with Christ. It was Paul’s supreme desire to know Christ and to be united with him. The recurring phrase, “in Christ,” implies personal union, a participation in Christ’s death and Resurrection. The Christ with whom Paul is united is not the man Jesus who is known “after the flesh.” He has been exalted and glorified, so that he is one with the Spirit.
                </p>
                <p>Christ-mysticism appears again in The Gospel According to John, particularly in the farewell discourse (chapters 14–16), where Jesus speaks of his impending death and of his return in the Spirit to unite himself with his followers. In the prayer of Jesus in chapter 17 there is a vision of an interpenetrating union of souls in which all who are one with Christ share his perfect union with the Father.</p>
                <p>
                  In the early Christian centuries the mystical trend found expression not only in the traditions of Pauline and Johannine Christianity (as in the writings of Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus of Lyon) but also in the Gnostics (early Christian heretics who viewed matter as evil and the spirit as good). Scholars still debate the origins of <xref refid="1775807" ty="1" topicid="236343" tocid="">Gnosticism</xref>, but most Gnostics thought of themselves as followers of Christ, albeit a Christ who was pure spirit. The religion of <xref refid="1775808" ty="1" topicid="622061" tocid="">Valentinus</xref>, who was excommunicated in about <e ty="s">ad</e> 150, is a notable example of the mysticism of the Gnostics. He believed that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> are alienated from God because of their spiritual ignorance; Christ brings them into the gnosis (esoteric revelatory knowledge) that is union with God. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="622061" tocid="">Valentinus</xref> held that all human beings come from God and that all will in the end return to God. Other Gnostic groups held that there were three types of people—“spiritual,” “psychic,” and “material”—and that only the first two can be <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="520007" tocid="">saved</xref>. The <e>Pistis Sophia</e> (3rd century) is preoccupied with the question of who finally will be saved. Those who are saved must renounce the world completely and follow the pure ethic of love and compassion so that they can be identified with Jesus and become rays of the divine Light.

                <headtitle>Eastern Christianity</headtitle>
                <p>
                  The classic forms of Eastern Christian mysticism appeared toward the end of the 2nd century, when the mysticism of the early church began to be expressed in categories of thought explicitly dependent on the Greek philosophical tradition of <xref refid="1775809" ty="1" topicid="464109" tocid="">Plato</xref> and his followers. This intermingling of primitive Christian themes with Greek speculative thought has been variously judged by later Christians, but contemporaries had no difficulty in seeing it as proof of the new religion’s ability to adapt and transform all that was good in the world. The philosophical emphasis on the unknowability of God found an echo in many biblical texts, affirming that the God of Abraham and the Father of Jesus could never be fully known. The understanding of the role of the preexistent Logos, or Word, of The Gospel According to John in the creation and restoration of the universe was clarified by locating the Platonic conception of Ideas in the Logos. Greek emphasis on the vision or contemplation (<e>theōria</e>) of God as the goal of human blessedness found a scriptural warrant in the sixth <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="57491" tocid="">Beatitude</xref>: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8). The notion of deification (<e>theiosis</e>) fit with the New Testament emphasis on becoming sons of God and texts such as 2 Peter 1:4, which talked about sharing in the divine nature. These adaptations later provided an entry for the language of union with God, especially after the notion of union became more explicit in <xref refid="1775812" ty="1" topicid="409036" tocid="">Neoplatonism</xref>, the last great pagan form of philosophical mysticism. Many of these themes are already present in germ in the works of <xref refid="1775811" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement of Alexandria</xref>, written in about 200. They are richly developed in the thought of <xref refid="1775813" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref>, the greatest Christian writer of the pre-Constantinian period and the earliest major speculative mystic in Christian history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Origen’s mystical theology, which made the union of God and man in Christ the pattern for the union of Christ and the believer, required a social matrix in which it could take on life as formative and expressive of Christian ideals. This was the achievement of early Christian <xref refid="1775814" ty="1" topicid="388935" tocid="">monasticism</xref>, the movement into the desert that began to transform ideals of Christian perfection at the beginning of the 4th century. The combination of the religious experience of the desert Christians and the generally Origenist theology that helped shape their views created the first great strand of Christian mysticism, one that remains central to the East and that was to dominate in the West until the end of the 12th century. Though not all Eastern Christian mystical texts were deeply imbued with Platonism, all were marked by the monastic experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first great mystical writer of the desert was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196798" tocid="">Evagrius Ponticus</xref> (346–399), whose works were influenced by Origen. His writings show a clear distinction between the ascetic, or “practical,” life and the contemplative, or “theoretical,” life, a distinction that was to become classic in Christian history. His disciple, <xref refid="1775815" ty="1" topicid="98154" tocid="">John Cassian</xref>, conveyed Evagrian mysticism to the monks of western Europe, especially in the exposition of the “degrees of prayer” in his <e>Collations of the Fathers</e>, or <e>Conferences</e>. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245696" tocid="">Gregory of Nyssa</xref>, the younger brother of <xref refid="1746598" ty="1" topicid="55066" tocid="">St. Basil the Great</xref>, sketched out a model for progress in the mystical path in his <e>Life of Moses</e> and, following the example of Origen, devoted a number of homilies to a mystical interpretation of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="553534" tocid="">Song of Solomon</xref>, showing how the book speaks both of Christ’s love for the church and of the love between the soul and the Divine Bridegroom.

                <p>
                  Perhaps the most influential of all Eastern Christian mystics is <xref refid="1775817" ty="1" topicid="481216" tocid="">Pseudo-Dionysius</xref>, who was probably a Syrian monk of the 5th or 6th century and who wrote in the name of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="481216" tocid="">Dionysius the Areopagite</xref>, Paul’s convert at Athens. In the chief works of Pseudo-Dionysius, <e>Mystical Theology</e> and <e>On the Divine Names</e>, the main emphasis was on the ineffability of God (“the Divine Dark”) and hence on the “apophatic” or “negative” approach to God. Through a gradual process of ascension from material things to spiritual realities and an eventual stripping away of all created beings in “unknowing,” the soul arrives at “union with Him who transcends all being and all knowledge” (<e>Mystical Theology</e>, chapter 1). The writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius also popularized the threefold division of the mystical life into purgative, illuminative, and unitive stages. Later Eastern mystical theologians, especially Maximus the Confessor in the 7th century, adopted much of this thought but imbued it with greater Christological emphasis, showing that union with God is possible only through the action of the God-man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eastern mystics distinguish between the essence of God and divine attributes, which they regard as energies that penetrate the universe. Creation is a process of emanation, whereby the divine Being is “transported outside of Himself…to dwell within the heart of all things…” (Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, <e>On the Divine Names</e>, iv. 13). The divinization of humanity is fundamental to Eastern mysticism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Divinization comes through contemplative prayer, and especially through the method of <xref refid="1775819" ty="1" topicid="264170" tocid="">Hesychasm</xref> (from <e>hesychia</e>, “stillness”), which was adopted widely by the Eastern monks. The method consisted in the concentration of the mind on the divine Presence, induced by the repetition of the “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303226" tocid="">Jesus-prayer</xref>” (later formalized as “Lord <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner”). This culminated in the ecstatic vision of the divine Light and was held to divinize the soul through the divine energy implicit in the name of Jesus. Although much of this program appears in the writings of <xref refid="1775821" ty="1" topicid="577844" tocid="">Symeon the New Theologian</xref> (<e>c.</e> 949–1022), a monk of Constantinople, it reached its most developed form in the works of <xref refid="1775822" ty="1" topicid="439149" tocid="">Gregory Palamas</xref> (1296–1359), who defended the Hesychast tradition against its opponents.

The earliest of the mystics to be denounced as heretics were the Messalians (Syriac for “praying people”) of the 4th century.

                  The founder of Latin Christian mysticism is <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine</xref>, bishop of Hippo (354–430). In his <e>Confessions</e> Augustine mentions two experiences of “touching” or “attaining” God. Later, in the <e>Literal Commentary on Genesis</e>, he introduced a triple classification of visions—corporeal, spiritual (i.e., imaginative), and intellectual—that influenced later mystics for centuries. Although he was influenced by Neoplatonist philosophers such as Plotinus, Augustine did not speak of personal union with God in this life. His teaching, like that of the Eastern Fathers, emphasized the ecclesial context of Christian mysticism and the role of Christ as mediator in attaining deification, or the restoration of the image of the Trinity in the depths of the soul. The basic elements of Augustine’s teaching on the vision of God, the relation of the active and contemplative lives, and the sacramental dimension of Christian mysticism were summarized by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Pope Gregory I the Great</xref> in the 6th century and conveyed to the medieval West by many monastic authors.

                  Two factors were important in the development of this classic <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="43011" tocid="">Augustinian</xref> form of Western mysticism. The first was the translation of the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and other Eastern mystics by the 9th-century thinker <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="191466" tocid="">Johannes Scotus Erigena</xref>. In combining the Eastern and Western mystical traditions, Erigena created the earliest version of a highly speculative negative mysticism that was later often revived. The other new moment began in the 12th century when new forms of religious life burst on the scene, especially among monks and those priests who endeavoured to live like monks (the canons). The major schools of 12th-century mysticism were inspired by new trends in monastic piety, especially those introduced by <xref refid="1775828" ty="1" topicid="26753" tocid="">Anselm of Canterbury</xref>, but they developed these in a systematic fashion unknown to previous centuries. The great figures of the era, especially <xref refid="1775829" ty="1" topicid="62413" tocid="">Bernard of Clairvaux</xref> among the Cistercians and <xref refid="1775830" ty="1" topicid="502566" tocid="">Richard of Saint-Victor</xref> among the canons, have remained the supreme teachers of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400861" tocid="">mystical</xref> theology in Catholic Christianity, along with the Spanish mystics of the 16th century.

                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="118670" tocid="">Cistercian</xref> and Victorine authors made two significant contributions to the development of Catholic mysticism: first, a detailed study of the stages of the ascent of the soul to God on the basis of a profound understanding of the human being as the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26) and, second, a new emphasis on the role of love as the power that unites the soul to God. Building on both Origen and Augustine, Bernard and his contemporaries made affective, or marital, union with God in oneness of spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17) a central theme in Western mysticism, though along with <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Gregory the Great</xref> they insisted that “love itself is a form of knowing,” that is, of vision or contemplation of God.

                  </thumbasm>The great mystics of the 12th century contributed to an important expansion of mysticism in the following century. For the first time mysticism passed beyond the confines of the monastic life, male writers, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331848" tocid="">Latin language</xref>. This major shift is evident not only in the life of <xref refid="1775831" ty="1" topicid="216793" tocid="">Francis of Assisi</xref>, who emphasized the practical following of Jesus and came to be identified with him in a new form of Christ-mysticism, manifested in his reception of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="566237" tocid="">stigmata</xref>, or wounds of the crucified Christ, but also in the remarkable proliferation of new forms of religious life and mystical writing in the vernacular on the part of women. Although female mystics such as <xref refid="1775832" ty="1" topicid="265747" tocid="">Hildegard of Bingen</xref> and Elizabeth of Schönau were an important influence on mysticism and spirituality in the 12th century, the 13th century witnessed a flowering of interest in mysticism among women, evident in the Flemish Hadewijch of Brabant, the German Mechthild von Magdeburg, the French Marguerite Porete, and the Italians Clare of Assisi and Àngela da Foligno.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the important themes of the new mysticism of the 13th century was a form of Dionysian theology in which the stage of divine darkness surpassing all understanding was given a strong affective emphasis, as well as the emergence of an understanding of union with God that insisted upon a union of indistinction in which God and the soul become one without any medium. The first of these tendencies is evident in the writings of <xref refid="1775833" ty="1" topicid="72743" tocid="">Bonaventure</xref>, the supreme master of Franciscan mysticism; the second is present in some of the women mystics, but its greatest proponent was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="168703" tocid="">Dominican</xref> <xref refid="1775834" ty="1" topicid="178072" tocid="">Meister Eckhart</xref>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eckhart taught that “God’s ground and the soul’s ground is one ground,” and the way to the realization of the soul’s identity with God lay less in the customary practices of the religious life than in a new state of awareness achieved through radical detachment from all created things and a breakthrough to the God beyond God. Though Eckhart’s thought remained Christological in its emphasis on the necessity for the “birth of Son in the soul,” his expressions of the identity between the soul that had undergone this birth and the Son of God seemed heretical to many. Without denying the importance of the basic structures of the Christian religion, and while insisting that his radical preaching to the laity was capable of an orthodox interpretation, Eckhart and the new mystics of the 13th century were a real challenge to traditional Western ideas of mysticism. Their teaching seemed to imply an autotheism in which the soul became identical with God, and many feared that this might lead to a disregard of the structures and sacraments of the church as the means to salvation and even to an antinomianism that would view the mystic as exempt from the moral law. In 1329, therefore, Pope <xref refid="1775835" ty="1" topicid="304898" tocid="">John XXII</xref> condemned 28 of Eckhart’s propositions as heretical or open to evil interpretation. Eckhart, however, seems to have retracted these errors before his death in 1327 or 1328.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even before Eckhart’s posthumous condemnation, the church struck out against the mystics. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="628245" tocid="">Council of Vienne</xref> condemned their errors in 1311, shortly after Marguerite Porete was burned as a heretic for continuing to disseminate her book, <e>The Mirror of Simple Souls</e>. Marguerite’s work was a highly popular treatise and handbook that described the seven stages of the ascent to God and maintained that the soul could achieve union with God while still on earth. The council associated these views with the <xref refid="1775836" ty="1" topicid="58641" tocid="">Beguines</xref>, groups of religious women who did not live in cloister or follow a recognized rule of life. The council also denounced the Beghards, a group of heretical mystics who were the male counterparts of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="58641" tocid="">Beguines</xref> and were often associated with them, for their antinomian and libertine views. In the centuries that followed, some mystics were condemned and others executed, though evidence for a widespread “mystical heresy” is lacking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The great mystical writers of the late Middle Ages, however, took pains to prove their orthodoxy. Eckhart’s followers among the Rhineland mystics, especially <xref refid="1775837" ty="1" topicid="575571" tocid="">Heinrich Suso</xref> and <xref refid="1775838" ty="1" topicid="584346" tocid="">Johann Tauler</xref>, defended his memory but qualified his daring language. Texts such as the anonymous <e>Theologia Germanica</e> of the late 14th century, which reflects the ideas of the loose groups of mystics who called themselves the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="220269" tocid="">Friends of God</xref>, conveyed this German mysticism to the Reformers. The rich mystical literature that developed in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="349663" tocid="">Low Countries</xref> reached its culmination in writings of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="514366" tocid="">Jan van Ruysbroeck</xref> (1293–1381). In Italy two remarkable women, <xref refid="1775839" ty="1" topicid="99707" tocid="">Catherine of Siena</xref> in the 14th century and <xref refid="1775840" ty="1" topicid="99705" tocid="">Catherine of Genoa</xref> in the 15th, made important contributions to the theory and practice of mysticism. The 14th century also was the “Golden Age” of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="700965" tocid="">English</xref> mysticism, as conveyed in the writings of the hermit <xref refid="1775841" ty="1" topicid="507093" tocid="">Richard Rolle</xref>; the canon <xref refid="1775842" ty="1" topicid="265977" tocid="">Walter Hilton</xref>, who wrote <e>The Scale</e> (or <e>Ladder</e>) <e>of Perfection</e>; the anonymous author of <e>The Cloud of Unknowing</e>; and his contemporary, the visionary recluse <xref refid="1775843" ty="1" topicid="307843" tocid="">Julian of Norwich</xref>, whose <e>Revelations of Divine Love</e> is unsurpassed in English mystical literature. Julian’s meditations on the inner meaning of her revelations of the crucified Christ express the mystical solidarity of all humanity in the Redeemer, who is conceived of as a nurturing mother.

                  In the 16th century the centre of Roman Catholic mysticism shifted to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="557573" tocid="">Spain</xref>, the great Roman Catholic power at the time of the Reformation. Important mystics came both from the traditional religious orders, such as Francis de Osuna among the Franciscans, Luis de León among the Augustinians, and Luis de Grenada among the Dominicans, and from the new orders, as with Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. The two pillars of Spanish mysticism, however, were <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="587885" tocid="">Teresa of Ávila</xref> (1515–82) and her friend <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="305126" tocid="">John of the Cross</xref> (1542–91), both members of the reform movement in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="96165" tocid="">Carmelite</xref> order. Teresa’s <e>Life</e> is one of the richest and most convincing accounts of visionary and unitive experiences in Christian mystical literature; her subsequent synthesis of the seven stages on the mystical path, <e>The Interior Castle</e>, has been used for centuries as a basic handbook. John of the Cross was perhaps the most profound and systematic of all Roman Catholic mystical thinkers. His four major works, <e>The Dark Night of the Soul</e>, <e>The Ascent of Mount Carmel</e>, <e>The Spiritual Canticle</e>, and <e>The Living Flame of Love</e>, constitute a full theological treatment of the active and passive purgations of the sense and the spirit, the role of illumination, and the unification of the soul with God in spiritual marriage.

                  In the 17th century <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="215768" tocid="">France</xref> took the lead with figures such as <xref refid="1775844" ty="1" topicid="216820" tocid="">Francis of Sales</xref>, <xref refid="1775845" ty="1" topicid="62881" tocid="">Pierre de Bérulle</xref>, Brother Lawrence (the author of <e>The Practice of the Presence of God</e>), and Marie Guyard. At this time concentration on the personal experience of the mystic as the source for “mystical theology” (as against the common scriptural faith and sacramental life of the church) led to the creation of mysticism as a category and the description of its adherents as mystics. At the same time, the rise of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="487288" tocid="">Quietist</xref> controversy brought about renewed conflict over mysticism. A Spaniard resident in Rome, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="388345" tocid="">Miguel de Molinos</xref>, author of the popular <e>Spiritual Guide</e> (1675), was condemned for his doctrine of the “One Act,” that is, the teaching that the will, once fixed on God in contemplative prayer, cannot lose its union with the divine. In France <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="250076" tocid="">Mme Guyon</xref> and her adviser, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="204194" tocid="">François Fénelon</xref>, archbishop of Cambrai, were also condemned for Quietist tendencies emphasizing the role of pure love to the detriment of ecclesiastical practice. These debates cast a pall over the role of mysticism in Roman Catholicism into the 20th century, though important mystics continued to be found, most notably <xref refid="1746790" ty="1" topicid="376458" tocid="">Thomas Merton</xref> and Pope John <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446940" tocid="">Paul II</xref>.

Among traditional Lutherans <xref refid="1775848" ty="1" topicid="35700" tocid="">Johann Arndt</xref> (1555–1621) in his <e>Four Books on True Christianity</e> took up many of the themes of medieval mysticism in the context of Reformation theology and prepared the way for the spiritual revival known as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="459967" tocid="">Pietism</xref>, within which mystics such as Count von Zinzendorf flourished. The important mystics in England included the <xref refid="1774053" ty="1" topicid="90687" tocid="">Cambridge Platonists</xref> (a group of Anglican divines), the <xref refid="1774055" ty="1" topicid="486026" tocid="">Quakers</xref>, and <xref refid="1774054" ty="1" topicid="332794" tocid="">William Law</xref> (1686–1761).

                <p>
                  Protestant mysticism emphasized the divine element in humanity, which was called the “spark” or “ground” of the soul, the “divine image” or “holy self,” the “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="288537" tocid="">Inner Light</xref>,” or the “Christ within.” This was one of the essential elements of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501356" tocid="">Rhineland</xref> mysticism and shows the connection between medieval and Reformation mysticism. For Böhme and the Spirituals, essential reality lies in the ideal world, which Böhme described as “the uncreated Heaven.” Böhme adopted the Gnostic belief that the physical world arose from a primeval fall, renewed with the Fall of Adam. His teaching was the main formative influence on the developed outlook of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="332794" tocid="">William Law</xref> and <xref refid="1775850" ty="1" topicid="68793" tocid="">William Blake</xref> (1757–1827).

                  For Protestant as well as for Roman Catholic mystics, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="545534" tocid="">sin</xref> is the assertion of the self in its separation from God. The divine life is embodied in “the true holy self that lies within the other” (Böhme, <e>First Epistle</e>). When that self is manifested, there is a birth of God (or of Christ) in the soul. Protestant mystics rejected the Lutheran and Calvinist doctrine of the total corruption of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275811" tocid="">human nature</xref>. William Law remarked, “The eternal Word of God lies hid in thee, as a spark of the divine nature” (<e>The Spirit of Prayer</e>, I.2). “The eternal Word of God” is the inner Christ, incarnate whenever people rise into union with God. The Spirituals also viewed Christ as the ideal humanity born in God from all eternity. This conception received its greatest emphasis from Schwenckfeld, who, unlike Protestant mystics generally, taught that humans as created beings are totally corrupt; salvation means deliverance from the creaturely nature and union with the heavenly Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Protestant mystics explicitly recognize that the divine Light or Spark is a universal principle. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="157545" tocid="">Hans Denck</xref> in the early 16th century spoke of the witness of the Spirit in “heathens and Jews.” <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="216907" tocid="">Sebastian Franck</xref>, like the Cambridge Platonists, found divine revelation in the work of the sages of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244154" tocid="">Greece</xref> and Rome. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="215366" tocid="">George Fox</xref> cited the conscience of the Native Americans as proof of the universality of the Inner Light. William Law described non-Christian saints as “apostles of a Christ within.” Protestant mystics stated plainly that, for the mystic, supreme authority lies of necessity not in the written word of Scripture but in the Word of God in the self. Fox said, “I saw, in that Light and Spirit that was before the Scriptures were given forth” (<e>Journal</e>, chapter 2). It was especially on this ground that the mystics came into conflict with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="193250" tocid="">established church</xref>, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant.

                <p>
                  The Ranters provide a good example of the conflict between mysticism and established religion. They held, with Fox and Hendrik Niclaes, that perfection is possible in this life. Puritan leaders under the Commonwealth denounced them for their “blasphemous and execrable opinions,” and there was, no doubt, an <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28267" tocid="">antinomian</xref> tendency among them that rejected the principle of moral law.

              <headtitle>Stages of Christian mysticism</headtitle>
              <p>
                Christian mystics have described the stages of the return of the soul to God in a variety of ways. According to the Belgian Jesuit Joseph Maréchal, Christian mysticism includes three broadly defined stages: (1) the gradual integration of the ego under the mastery of the idea of a personal God and according to a program of prayer and asceticism, (2) a transcendent revelation of God to the soul experienced as ecstatic contact or union, frequently with a suspension of the faculties, and (3) “a kind of readjustment of the soul’s faculties” by which it regains contact with creatures “under the immediate and perceptible influence of God present and acting in the soul” (Maréchal, <e>Studies in the Psychology of the Mystics</e>). This final stage, which almost all of the greatest Christian mystics have insisted upon, belies the usual claim that mysticism is a selfish flight from the world and an avoidance of moral responsibility.

                <p>
                  The mystics agree on the necessity of dying to the false self dominated by forgetfulness of God. To attain the goal, the soul must be purified of all those feelings, desires, and attitudes that separate it from God. This dying to the self implies the “dark night of the soul” in which God gradually and sometimes painfully purifies the soul to ready it for the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590940" tocid="">divine manifestation</xref>.
                </p>

                  Christian mystics have always taken Christ, especially the crucified Christ, as the model for this process. According to the <e>Theologia Germanica</e>, “Christ’s human nature was so utterly bereft of self, and apart from all creatures, as no man’s ever was, and was nothing but a ‘house and habitation of God’” (chapter 15). Following Christ involves a dying to self, a giving up of oneself wholly to God, so that one may be possessed by divine Love. Such detachment and purgation were frequently expressed in extreme terms that imply the renunciation of all human ties. Paradoxically, those who insist upon the most absolute detachment also emphasize that purifying the self is more a matter of internal attitude than of flight from the world and external penance. In the words of William Law: “The one true way of dying to self wants no cells, monasteries or pilgrimages. It is the way of patience, humility and resignation to God” (<e>The Spirit of Love</e>, Part 1).

Many Christian mystics experienced unusual and extraordinary psychic phenomena—visions, locutions, and other altered states of consciousness. The majority of mystics, however, have insisted that such phenomena are secondary to the true essence of mysticism and can even be dangerous. “We must never rely on them or accept them,” as John of the Cross said in <e>The Ascent of Mount Carmel</e>, 2.11.

                <p>
                  Christian mystics claim that the soul may be lifted into a union with God so close and so complete that it is merged in the being of God and loses the sense of any separate existence. Jan van Ruysbroeck wrote that in the experience of union “we can nevermore find any distinction between ourselves and God” (<e>The Sparkling Stone</e>, chapter 10); and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178072" tocid="">Eckhart</xref> speaks of the birth of the Son in the soul in which God “makes me his only-begotten Son without any difference” (German <e>Sermons</e>, 6).

                <p>
                  The goal of the mystic is not simply a transient ecstasy; it is a permanent state of being in which the person’s nature is transformed or deified. This state is frequently spoken of as a spiritual marriage involving God and the soul. This unitive life has two main aspects. First, while the consciousness of self and the world remains, that consciousness is accompanied by a continuous sense of union with God, as Teresa of Ávila clearly shows in discussing the seventh mansion in <e>The Interior Castle</e>. Brother Lawrence wrote that while he was at work in his kitchen he possessed God “in as great tranquillity as if I were upon my knees at the Blessed Sacrament” (<e>The Practice of the Presence of God</e>, chapter 4). Second, the spiritual marriage is a theopathic state: the soul is felt to be in all things the organ or instrument of God. In the unitive life Mme Guyon says that the soul “no longer lives or works of herself, but God lives, acts and works in her.” In this state the mystic is able to engage in manifold activities without losing the grace of union. In the words of Ignatius of Loyola, the mystic is “contemplative in action.”

                <p>
                  The earliest form of Christian mysticism was the Christ-mysticism of Paul and John. Although Christian mysticism in its traditional expression has centred on the desire for union with God, Christ-mysticism has always been present in the church. The Eastern Church emphasized the divine Light that appeared to the disciples at the Transfiguration, and mystics sought to identify with this light of Christ in his divine glory. Symeon says of a certain mystic that “he possessed Christ wholly.… He was in fact entirely Christ.” As a result of the influence of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine</xref>, in the Catholic West it is in and through the one Christ, the union of Head and body that is the church, that humans come to experience God. For Augustine the mystical life is Christ “transforming us into himself” (<e>Homily on Psalm</e>, 32.2.2). During the Middle Ages some of the most profound expressions of Christ-mysticism were voiced by women mystics, such as Catherine of Siena and Julian of Norwich. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="336369" tocid="">Luis de León</xref> spoke of the theopathic life in terms of Christ-mysticism: “The very Spirit of Christ comes and is united with the soul—nay, is infused throughout its being, as though he were soul of its soul indeed.”

                <p>
                  The Protestant attempt to return to primitive Christianity has led to strong affirmations of Christ-mysticism. The early <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="486026" tocid="">Quaker</xref> George Keith wrote that Christ is born spiritually in humanity when “his life and spirit are united unto the soul.” The chief representative of Christ-mysticism among the early Protestants, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="528686" tocid="">Kaspar Schwenckfeld</xref>, held that Christ was from all eternity the God-man, and as such he possessed a body of spiritual flesh in which he lived on Earth and which he now possesses in heaven. In his exalted life Christ unites himself inwardly with human souls and imparts to them his own divinity.

                <p>
                  Pure God-mysticism is rare in Christianity, though not unknown, as Catherine of Genoa shows. Christ as God incarnate is the Word, the second Person of the Trinity, and Christian mysticism has, from an early era, exhibited a strong Trinitarian dimension, though this has been understood in different ways. What ties the diverse forms of Trinitarian mysticism together is the insistence that through Christ the Christian comes to partake of the inner life of the Trinity. The mysticism of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432455" tocid="">Origen</xref>, for example, emphasizes the marriage of the Word and the soul within the union of Christ and the church but holds out the promise that through this action souls will be made capable of receiving the Father (<e>First Principles</e>, 3.6.9). The mystical thought of Augustine and his medieval followers, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="502566" tocid="">Richard of Saint-Victor</xref>, William of Saint-Thierry, and Bonaventure, is deeply Trinitarian. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178072" tocid="">Meister Eckhart</xref> taught that the soul’s indistinction from God meant that it was to be identified with the inner life of the Trinity—that is, with the Father giving birth to the Son, the Son being born, and the Holy Spirit proceeding from both. A similar teaching is found in Ruysbroeck. John of the Cross wrote of mystical union that “it would not be a true and total transformation if the soul were not transformed into the three Persons of the Most Holy Trinity” (<e>Spiritual Canticle</e>, stanza 39.3). Such strong Trinitarian emphasis is rarer, but not absent from Protestant mysticism.

                <p>
                  The most daring forms of Christian mysticism have emphasized the absolute unknowability of God. They suggest that true contact with the transcendent involves going beyond all that we speak of as God—even the Trinity—to an inner “God beyond God,” a divine Darkness or Desert in which all distinction is lost. This form of “mystical atheism” has seemed suspicious to established religion; its adherents have usually tried to calm the suspicions of the orthodox by an insistence on the necessity, though incompleteness, of the affirmative ways to God. One of the earliest and most important exponents of this teaching was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="481216" tocid="">Pseudo-Dionysius</xref>, who distinguished “the super-essential Godhead” from all positive terms ascribed to God, even the Trinity (<e>The Divine Names</e>, chapter 13). In the West this tradition emerged later; it is first found in Erigena in the 9th century and is especially evident in the Rhineland school in the 13th and 14th centuries. According to Eckhart, even being and goodness are “garments” or “veils” under which God is hidden. In inviting his hearers to “break through” to the hidden Godhead, he exclaimed, “Let us pray to God that we may be free of ‘God,’ and that we may apprehend and rejoice in that everlasting truth in which the highest angel and the fly and the soul are equal” (German <e>Sermons</e>, 52). The notion of the hidden Godhead was renewed in the teaching of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="71646" tocid="">Jakob Böhme</xref>, who spoke of it as the <e>Ungrund</e>—“the great Mystery,” “the Abyss,” “the eternal Stillness.” He stressed the fact of divine becoming (in a nontemporal sense): God is eternally the dark mystery of which nothing can be said but ever puts on the nature of light, love, and goodness wherein the divine is revealed to human beings.

              <p>The study of Christian mysticism reveals both the unity of mysticism as an aspect of religion and the diversity of expression that it has received in the history of Christian faith. The mystic claims contact with an order of reality transcending the world of the senses and the ordinary forms of discursive intellectual knowing. Christian mystics affirm that this contact is with God the Trinity and can take place only through the mediation of Christ and the church. The claim is all the more significant in that Eastern Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and Protestants are here in agreement.</p>
              <p>Without suggesting that all mysticism is everywhere one and the same, it can be said that the Christian mystics take their stand with the mystics of other traditions in pointing to “the Beyond that is within.” If Christianity is to embark upon truly cooperative relations with other religions, it must be deeply imbued with the insight and experience of the mystics. Even if it is to attempt to plumb the depths of its own history, it cannot neglect its mystical dimensions.</p>

            </headtitle>
            <p>Myths and legends number among the most creative and abundant contributions of Christianity to the history of human culture. They have inspired artists, dramatists, clerics, and others to contemplate the wondrous effects of Christian salvation on the cosmos and its inhabitants. They conjoin diverse cultural horizons and fuse them creatively with the religious histories that exist prior to and alongside the orthodox Christian world. Even for the less pious and the nonbelievers, the distinctive visions of reality presented in Christian legend or myth and the symbolic actions based upon them have helped to form the fundaments of Western civilization. Pilgrimage to the shrines of the saints, for example, touches economic and political life, military history, visual and musical arts, popular devotion, and the exchange of scientific information. Moreover, the content of the myths and legends themselves has contributed directly to theories about religion, society, politics, art, astronomy, economics, music, and history.</p>
            <p>Myths narrate the sacred events that unfolded in the first time, the epoch of creative beginnings. In that primordial period supernatural beings brought reality into existence. In that sense, myth relates only those things that have really occurred—that is, those realities that have revealed themselves completely. These realities become the foundation of the world, society, and human destiny. The intervention of sacred and supernatural beings accounts for the conditions of the world and humanity today. Myth describes the acts and beings whose appearance shaped material existence in all its concrete specificity.</p>
            <p>
              Legends are episodic continuations of mythic narratives; they describe the effects of primordial events on an imagined history that is as fabulous as the primordial mysteries that brought that history into being. Legends describe history in fantastic terms in order to clarify the significance of the powers that underlie it. The repetitiveness and redundancy of legends demonstrate that many different legends spring from the same mythic sources—that is, from the same primordial events and creative powers. But variants of legend are reminders that myths and their outcomes are historically conditioned and questioned. Christian legend contends with the question of what the Christian mystery means in the here and now. Because of their local <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495116" tocid="">frame of reference</xref>, legends vary incessantly, and widely different accounts emerge from diverse locales and periods. Favourite legendary themes are the struggles and miraculous adventures of heroes in the faith, accounts that edify the faith and bolster the courage of the listener.

              <headtitle>Characteristics of Christian myth and legend</headtitle>
              <p>
                An appreciation of the positive role of myth and legend in culture has been long in coming. Christian theology, taking its lead from Greek philosophy, at first denigrated the value of myth. In constructing the canon and in choosing authoritative interpretations of it, the early Christians suppressed or excluded myth and legend in favour of philosophy, history, and law. The opinion expressed in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="596334" tocid="">First Letter of Paul to Timothy</xref> echoes the prevalent Hellenistic view of myth: “Have nothing to do with godless and silly myths” (1 Timothy 4:7). In spite of that, a number of important mythical themes remain central to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="412114" tocid="">New Testament</xref>—e.g., Christ as the second Adam (Romans 5:12–14), the heavenly spheres (2 Corinthians 12:2–4), and the celestial battle between angels and demons.

              <p>
                The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="30100" tocid="">Apologists</xref>, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121112" tocid="">Clement of Alexandria</xref>, used myth and legend as allegories to make Christian concepts intelligible to Greek converts. But Clement (e.g., in his <e>Protreptikos</e> [“Exhortation”]) and other <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Fathers</xref> roundly condemned the belief that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244670" tocid="">Greek myths</xref> might be autonomous sources of truth. In spite of its ambiguous use of mythic symbols and themes, the history of Christian doctrine, from its origins to the present day, testifies to the systematic excision of legendary and mythical elements from Christian orthodoxy. Even folk practices, based on legend, were policed and suppressed. In 692, for example, the <xref refid="1633735" ty="1" topicid="487431" tocid="">Quinisext Council</xref> (also known as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="487431" tocid="">Trullan Synod</xref>), an episcopal council convoked by the Byzantine emperor <xref refid="1775856" ty="1" topicid="308902" tocid="">Justinian II</xref>, prohibited baking bread in the form of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="629896" tocid="">Virgin Mary</xref>’s placenta, as was the custom on the afterbirth day (that is, the day after Christ’s birth).
              </p>
              <p>
                A second cause for the delay in evaluating the positive contributions of myth and legend to religious life is the theories of religion that have flourished since the time of the European <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="188441" tocid="">Enlightenment</xref>.

More intimate knowledge of mythic traditions in Africa, India, Oceania, and the Americas, however, has disclosed the important role myth plays in culture and highlighted the coherence and sophisticated order of myth.

                    By the time the New Testament was written, Jewish <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="29733" tocid="">apocalyptic</xref> writings (symbolic or cryptographic literature portraying God’s dramatic intervention in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267522" tocid="">history</xref> and catastrophic dramas at the end of a cosmic epoch) had already produced theories of history that reworked Indo-<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="293595" tocid="">Iranian</xref> notions about the ages of the world, influencing Christian views of time, history, and human destiny.

The forces of good and evil battled for the allegiance and the souls of human beings.

Within this framework of the mythical history of the ages of the world, Christian apocalyptic re-envisions a number of themes important to Jewish apocalypticism: the Son of man and the great tribulation prior to the judgment of the world; the battle between Christ and the <xref refid="1775860" ty="1" topicid="27850" tocid="">Antichrist</xref>, a false messiah or “great liar” who denies that Jesus is the Christ and who pitches the world into moral confusion and physical chaos; and the ultimate triumph over Satan, who appears as a dragon but who no longer deceives the nations of the world.

The <e>First Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus</e> (known also as the Arabic Infancy Gospel), for example, recounts that, one day, Jesus and his playmates were playing on a rooftop and one fell down and died. The other playmates ran away, leaving Jesus accused of pushing the dead boy. Jesus, however, went to the dead boy and asked, “Zeinunus, Zeinunus, who threw you down from the housetop?” The dead boy answered that Jesus had not done it and named another (<e>I Infancy</e> 19:4–11). This and similar narratives describe the “hidden life” of Jesus in the 30 years before his public ministry began.

Once orthodoxy had been established, these mythic themes appeared clumsy and, in retrospect, heterodox or even heretical.

                    Groups of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236343" tocid="">Gnostics</xref> and heretics, who based their ideas on alternative interpretations of the economy of salvation, developed exotic Christian myths, legends, and practices. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, dualists believed that the world of matter created by an evil god (identified as the god of the Book of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="228795" tocid="">Genesis</xref>) and the realm of the spirit created by a good god (revealed in the New Testament) were irreconcilably pitted against one another. The Gnostic sects—among them the Valentinians, Basilidians, Ophites, and Simonians—developed a variety of myths. Among them were those of <xref refid="1775875" ty="1" topicid="622061" tocid="">Valentinus</xref>, who lived in Rome and Alexandria in the mid-2nd century. Valentinian myths describe how the pleroma (spiritual realm) that existed in the beginning was disrupted by a Fall. The Creator God of Genesis, aborted from the primordial world, became a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="157116" tocid="">Demiurge</xref> and created the material universe. He deliberately created two kinds of human being, the hylics and the psychics, and animated them with his breath. Unknown to the Demiurge, however, certain remnants of pleromic wisdom contained in his breath lodged as spiritual particles in matter and produced a third group of beings called pneumatics. The God of Genesis then sought to prevent Gnostics from discovering their past origins, present powers, and future destinies. Gnostics (the pneumatics) contain within themselves divine sparks expelled from the pleroma. Christ was sent from the pleroma to teach Gnostics the saving knowledge (gnosis) of their true identities and was crucified when the Demiurge of Genesis discovered that Christ (the male partner of the feminine Holy Spirit) was in Jesus. After Christ returned to the pleroma, the Holy Spirit descended.

The star and its bright light led to, or became, the Holy Child, the son of the Light, who redeems the world.

                    The cult (system of religious beliefs and rituals) of the saints emerged in the 3rd century and gained momentum from the 4th to the 6th century. The bones of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367142" tocid="">martyrs</xref> were believed to provide evidence of God’s power at work in the world, producing miracles and spectacles of the effectiveness of faith. The martyrs had imitated Christ even unto death, and the remains of their holy bodies were thought to be points of contact between earth and heaven. On the model of Christ’s Incarnation, the bones of martyred saints embodied God’s salvific power and thus became the centre of active cults. Relics were installed in basillicas or in special churches called martyria. The tombs of martyrs, on the margins of cities and towns, attracted pilgrims and processions. Legends described the prodigious virtues of martyrs and saints, as well as the dreams or visions that revealed the resting places of still more powerful relics. Each discovery (<e>inventio</e>) promised new and effective signs of divine redemption. Returning from distant places, especially Rome, pilgrims brought relics to their home churches. Thus, during the 8th century, bones and other relics were moved from southern Europe to the north and west.

                  <p>
                    Of all relic discoveries, the most impressive was that of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="607016" tocid="">True Cross</xref> (the cross upon which Jesus was crucified, found in September 335 or in 326, according to other accounts). The discovery of the cross (<e>inventio crucis</e>) was one of the more popular legends of the Middle Ages; the basic elements of the tradition had been established by the late 4th century and were associated with a pilgrimage Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made to Jerusalem in the 320s. According to the legend, Helena, prompted by a dream, located the place where the Cross lay buried and had the wood unearthed. Helena, the tale continues, realized what she found was the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="607016" tocid="">True Cross</xref> when a sick woman she had lie on it was healed. The power of the Cross, the history of the wood, and the story of its discovery became legendary.

                  <p>
                    Through the symbolism of the Cross, early Christian imagery perpetuated, and at the same time transformed, the myths of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648638" tocid="">World Tree</xref>. The sacred drama of Christ’s birth, death, and Resurrection participates in the rejuvenating rhythms of the fecund cosmos. Early Christians identified the Cross of Christ as the World Tree, which stood at the centre of cosmic space and stretched from earth to heaven. The Cross was fashioned of wood from the Tree of Good and Evil, which grew in the Garden of Eden. Below the tree lies Adam’s buried skull, baptized in Christ’s blood. The bloodied Cross-Tree gives forth the oil, wheat, grapes, and herbs used to prepare the materials administered in the sacraments that revitalize a fallen world. The Italian Renaissance painter <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="459853" tocid="">Piero della Francesca</xref> later depicted the myth of the True Cross in his frescoes in Arezzo, Italy. They portray the death of Adam, fallen at the foot of the Tree that provides wood for the crucifix on which Jesus is slain. The wood of the Cross, however, becomes the instrument of salvation and the holiest matter in Christendom, and the Cross itself became the focus of tales of fantastic historical episodes.

                    Helena was responsible for another great discovery when she found Christ’s tomb, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269911" tocid="">Holy Sepulchre</xref> in Jerusalem, which also became a highlight of Christian legend. Like the body of the Saviour, the tomb is a “holy of holies.” Its discovery was tantamount to the Resurrection, for its reemergence into the light of day was seen as a restoration of life where before only darkness reigned. The Cross and the tomb were woven together in legend. The desire to regain possession of the True Cross and the Holy Sepulchre was the source of inspiration for the Christian knights of the Crusades.

                  Christian myth and legend were adapted to new traditions as the faith expanded beyond its original cultural milieu of the Mediterranean into northern Europe. New saints and martyrs emerged during the process of expansion, and their miracles and other pious deeds were recorded in hagiographic works. As before, the saints and their relics were known for their miraculous cures, but they also performed miracles associated with new social conditions, such as releasing petitioners from prison. Moreover, a new hagiographic genre appeared that described the practice of <e>furta sacra</e> (“holy theft”). These accounts, most famously that of <xref refid="1634201" ty="1" topicid="414051" tocid="">St. Nicholas</xref>, detail the practice of stealing saints’ relics—removing relics from one shrine and placing them in a new one. The narratives describe the miracles that occurred in the process, including the saint’s unwillingness to move and the inability of the holy thief to move the relics.

Drawing from the Scriptures and ancient traditions, the legend of the Antichrist took shape in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In the 10th century <xref refid="1774098" ty="1" topicid="1319223" tocid="">Adso of Montier-en-Der</xref> collected these traditions in his popular and influential <e>Epistola ad Gerbergam reginam de ortu et tempore Antichristi</e> (“Letter to Queen Gerberga on the Place and Time of Antichrist”), a mirror image in the negative of the lives of Jesus and the saints.

                  A related legend was that of the “Last Emperor.” The myth began to form as early as the 4th century, and in the 7th century the legend was shaped further in the Syriac work of the Pseudo-Methodius, who wrote in response to the expansion of Islam into Christian territories. Translated into Greek and Latin, Pseudo-Methodius provided the basis for further reworking of the legend in the 10th and 11th centuries by writers in the Latin West. The legend itself describes the deeds of the last emperor of the world, who will arise in great anger to fight against the enemies of the faith. He will establish peace before fighting and defeating the armies of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="237108" tocid="">Gog and Magog</xref>.

                  A number of Christian myths, legends, and works of art were aimed at awakening religious capacities, turning the viewer or listener against repulsive forms of evil, and hastening the effects of the salvation achieved in Christ.

                  The 12th century also witnessed the rise of a new mythology of Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="267522" tocid="">history</xref>. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304176" tocid="">Joachim of Fiore</xref> (1130/35–1201/02) was an abbot of the Calabrian monastery of Fiore and was well-known in the Christian world of his day. On the vigil of Easter and on Pentecost Sunday, God infused him with special knowledge, which enabled him to decode history as a series of divine signs. According to Joachim, universal history has three stages, each age (<e>status</e>) corresponding to a person of the Holy Trinity. The first age, presided over by God the Father, was ruled by married men and propelled by their labour. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> presided over the age of the New Testament, an epoch ruled by the clergy and driven forward by the power of science and discipline. The two testamental periods featured the two kinds of people chosen in each, the Jews and the Gentiles. Joachim fascinated the faithful of his day with a prediction that the second age, the age of the New Testament presided over by Jesus Christ, would end in 1260. Then would dawn a new epoch, the third age, presided over by the Holy Spirit, guided by monks and fueled by their contemplation. It was to be an epoch of total love, joy, and freedom. But three and one-half years of cataclysm ruled by the Antichrist would precede entrance to this bliss.

                  Joachim promised that God’s mysterious saving power would burst fully into history in the immediate future and would change forever the fundamental structures of the cosmos as well as the social and ecclesiastical world. Joachim’s new vision of history generated critiques of the 13th-century church and society and was adopted by the Spiritual Franciscans and the violent heretic Fra Dolcino. His doctrine of the Trinity was condemned at the fourth <xref refid="1775940" ty="1" topicid="331538" tocid="">Lateran Council</xref> in 1215.

                  Christian legend and myth also found fertile ground in the practices of <xref refid="1775942" ty="1" topicid="13282" tocid="">alchemy</xref>. Through the perfection of metals the alchemists sought their own perfection and, indeed, the salvation of all matter.

These efforts at the reduction into prime matter were thought to make possible the re-creation of individual and cosmos as a single, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="405982" tocid="">pure element</xref>. Even the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456733" tocid="">philosopher’s stone</xref> or elixir was reinterpreted so that Christ appeared as the perfect matter produced by the alchemical process—that is, Christ was the stone of all wisdom and knowledge. In the alchemist’s spiritual forge, the Stone reemerged from the Matrix, the crucible containing the so-called Bath of Mary, whose amniotic fluids dissolved all impurities. This dissolution prepared one for rebirth as a perfect being. All matter was redeemed by immersion in the fluids of the womb where Jesus assumed the flesh. Mystical union with Christ’s death and physical regression to that same uterus where God became matter empowered the Christian alchemist to effect a new fusion of redeemed realities, freed of all impure dross. The alchemical tradition was secretly continued by a number of scientists, including the foremost pioneers of modern physics and chemistry: <xref refid="1775945" ty="1" topicid="211191" tocid="">Robert Fludd</xref>, <xref refid="1775944" ty="1" topicid="76496" tocid="">Robert Boyle</xref>, and Sir <xref refid="1775943" ty="1" topicid="413189" tocid="">Isaac Newton</xref>.

In the Middle Ages it was learned that <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="132838" tocid="">conjunctions</xref> of planets occur every 20 years on a minor scale and every 960 years on a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="359059" tocid="">major scale</xref>. This theory, described in the <e>Liber magnarum coniunctionum</e>, was advocated by <xref refid="1775946" ty="1" topicid="13134" tocid="">Albumazar</xref> (787–886), a disciple of al-Kindī (?–<e>c.</e> 870), a Muslim philosopher who assimilated Greek philosophy to Islam. <xref refid="1775947" ty="1" topicid="48177" tocid="">Roger Bacon</xref> used this theory to work out the chronology of great personalities in history and to map the chronological relationship of true prophets (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="14224" tocid="">Alexander the Great</xref>, Jesus Christ, Mani, and Muhammad), one for every 320 years. Based on observations of a supernova in 1604, <xref refid="1775948" ty="1" topicid="315225" tocid="">Johannes Kepler</xref> calculated the “true date” of the birth of Jesus. These calculations revitalized an interest in the Magi, who had followed the great star. Kepler believed that the conjunctions were unnatural events brought about by the miraculous acts of God, who had decided to lodge the birth of his son between the significant zodiacal signs of the Fish (Pisces) and the Ram (Aries).

Kepler’s scientific achievements confirmed the hopes of the Rosicrucians and became a foundation for the new secret order reputedly founded by Christian Rosenkreuz. The editors of Rosicrucian publications dated the death of their founder to 1484 and fixed the time of the discovery of his tomb as 1604 in order to coordinate the events with the last two great conjunctions of stars.

                <p>
                  The 20th century continued to generate important Christian myths and legend-based practices, including pilgrimages made on Marian feast days to holy wells and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="200475" tocid="">fairy rings</xref> outside the Irish town of Sneem and devotions at the tomb of Christ in Japan, where, according to local legend, Christ ended the long life of missionary travels he began after his mock death in Jerusalem. These acts and the explanations that accompany them detail the impact of Christian salvation on reality in modern times. In all the cultures where Christianity has been propagated, myth and legend express the fulfillment of the religious desires and hopes that constituted the religious traditions before contact with Christian revelation. The following examples suggest their variety and vitality.

                  The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="258167" tocid="">healing</xref> of sickness is, as it was in the time of the New Testament, a sign of the coming of the Kingdom of Christ in its fullness. In Africa, for example, many so-called Independent Churches have reinterpreted disease and rites of cure along Christian lines. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="169818" tocid="">Douala</xref>, Cameroon, during the 1980s, two healing prophets named Mallah and Marie-Lumière divided their disciples, whom they called the “sick ones of the Father,” into groups named for the important categories of illness described in the Gospels: the Blind, the Halt, the Lame, the Deaf, the Epileptic, the Dumb, and the Paralyzed. The disciples evidenced none of these physical symptoms, but they were asked to identify deep within themselves with the affliction described in the Gospel, so that salvation might touch them in their inner being. By becoming sick, they could be healed and thus join the elect. In lengthy sermons the healing prophets reimagined traditional African religious imagery and refashioned it in the light of Christian belief. The experience of their peculiar mystical disorders afforded a basis for social regrouping and for rethinking the past and present.

                  The Christian expression of sacred music and trance is often grounded in legend or myth. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="78101" tocid="">Brazil</xref>, for example, <xref refid="1775951" ty="1" topicid="355524" tocid="">Macumba</xref>, Candomblé, and other Afro-Brazilian cults have roots sunk deep into the religions of African slaves transplanted to the New World. Afro-Brazilian rites often centre on possession by a supernatural being, called an <e>orixá</e>. The innumerable <e>orixás</e> are ranked in hierarchies modeled on the pantheons of the Yoruba people of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="640491" tocid="">West Africa</xref>, among others. In Brazil (and in much of Afro-American religious life of the Americas), each <e>orixá</e> is identified with a specific Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="516666" tocid="">saint</xref>. In the Umbanda cult of Brazil, altars hold small plaster images of the Christian saints associated with the <e>orixás</e>. Each one of the saints presides over a domain of human activity or over a disease, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551247" tocid="">social group</xref>, geographic area, or craft. For example, Omolú, the god of smallpox, is identified with St. Lazarus, whose body, in Christian legend, is pocked with sores and who heals diseases of the skin. Oxossi, the Yoruba god of hunting, is associated with the bellicose St. George or St. Michael, the slayers of dragons and demons. Yansan, who ate the “magic” of her husband and now spits up lightning, is associated with St. Barbara, whose father was struck by lightning when he tried to force her to give up her Christian faith. In the worship site each <e>orixá</e> has its own stone, which is peculiarly shaped, coloured, or textured; arranged in a distinctive position on the altar; and identified as the Cross of Christ. A single saint may be identified with several <e>orixás</e> or vice versa. Regions vary the saintly identifications, and some designations shift over time. Each <e>orixá</e> has its own <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="501914" tocid="">musical rhythms</xref> and sounds. When called by drums, dance, and music, the supernatural being may take over the possessed medium, reveal valued information, and carry out effective symbolic acts on behalf of the community.

                  European communities in the 20th century remained fascinated with the rigorous asceticism of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="27407" tocid="">St. Anthony of Egypt</xref>, who repulsed the assaults of wild beasts, reptiles, and demons and remained steadfast in the faith. He is considered the patron of domestic animals, and in many parts of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="297474" tocid="">Italy</xref>, the drama of the feast of St. Anthony, historically associated with the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="645665" tocid="">winter solstice</xref>, rivals any other feast day of the Christian calendar. To celebrate his feast, the people of Fara Filiorum Petri, a town in the Abruzzi region of Italy, ignite enormous bonfires on the night of January 16. Each of the 12 outlying hamlets brings into the main town’s square a bundle (<e>farchia</e>) of long poles. Set on end, the bundles are lashed together to form a single tall mass, an act that commemorates the historical union of the mountain settlements as one bonded community. Then the bundles of <e>farchie</e>, 15 or more feet high, are set ablaze. The fire is believed to cleanse the community and hold at bay the evil forces of sickness and death. As the fire dies down, young men jump through the purifying flames. Spectators carry remnants of the blessed fire back to their homes, spreading the ashes in their stalls and on their fields.

                  The birth of Christ was still a focus in the 20th century for traditional legends and myths that had developed outside ecclesiastical institutions. In rural <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="508461" tocid="">Romania</xref>, for instance, on Christmas Eve groups of young <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="96438" tocid="">carolers</xref> (<e>colindatori</e>) proceed from house to house in the village, singing and collecting gifts of food. Often these carolers impersonate the saints, especially John, Peter, George, and Nicholas. The words of their songs (<e>colinde</e>) describe legendary heroes who carry the sun and wear the moon on their clothes. They live in paradisal worlds and subdue monstrous animals in order to leave the world free from harm and ready to renew itself in the fertile acts of spring.

                  The symbolic reenactments of legend often experiment with alternative <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social orders</xref> and criticize or reverse existing divisions of labour and prestige. In Sicilian-American communities of Texas, Louisiana, California, and elsewhere, the female head of the household dedicates and displays an altar to St. Joseph and thus fulfills a promise made in a moment of need. She prepares fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cakes, fig-filled pastries, pies, and special breads and uses them to decorate a series of tiers stretching from floor to ceiling. She also arranges on this festival altar the figurines of saints, the Virgin Mary, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="515526" tocid="">Sacred Heart</xref> of Jesus. The construction of this panorama takes nine days, a period that constitutes a ritual novena of prayer and devout action. Representatives who act in the accompanying ceremony play the roles of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269769" tocid="">Holy Family</xref> and other saints important to the altar display. Re-creating the Holy Family’s search for room in a Bethlehem inn on the night of the Nativity, the ritual drama builds toward the moment when the altar-giver opens her home to Joseph and Mary. As Mother Mary prepares to give birth to Jesus, the hostess readies her home, heart, and community so that they may become fit dwelling places for the sacred being. The presiding women play the roles of Magi-Kings bearing gifts of food and hospitality to the Holy Family and their entourage, which includes most of the neighbouring community. A single family can host from 500 to 1,000 people in the feast that terminates the celebration.

                  Sometimes the new Christian mythologies function as counter-theologies or theologies of resistance to the impositions of Christian culture. They criticize the Christian missionary enterprise even while they embrace aspects of the new religion. In the 20th century, for instance, biblical and Christian themes occupied a large part of the mythology of the Makiritare Indians in the upper <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="432619" tocid="">Orinoco River</xref> region of Venezuela. For them, Wanadi was the Supreme Being of great light and, although one being, he exists in three distinct persons (<e>damodede</e>, “spirit-doubles”). Over the course of creation and human history, Wanadi has sent his three incarnations to earth in order to create human beings and redeem them from the darkness into which they have fallen. In the end, Wanadi, the god incarnate who comes to save humankind, is crucified by mythical monsters called Fañurus (from the Spanish <e>españoles</e>: “Spaniards”), at the instigation of an evil being called Fadre (from the Spanish <e>padre</e>: “father” or “priest”). To all appearances, Wanadi was slain by the Fañurus, but, in fact, he cut his own insides out and allowed his inner spirit (<e>akato</e>) to dance free of his dead, cast-off body. Before his spirit ascends into heaven, Wanadi gathers his 12 disciples together and promises to return in a new and glorious body to destroy the evil world and create a new earth.

                <p>Unlike the orthodox canon of Christian scripture, which was inscribed and closed in the first centuries, Christian myth and legend have arisen anew throughout all of Christian history. It offers a record of the spread of Christianity—through the Mediterranean, eastern and western Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas—and highlights the diversity of cultures brought into contact with the Christian message of salvation. The diverse religious hopes, heroes, and rites of these cultures continue to shape reinterpretations of the life of Christ and his saintly followers.</p>
                <p>
                  Legend and myth constitute a record of critical reflection on Christian reality in all its dimensions—social, political, economic, doctrinal, and scriptural. No <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="550940" tocid="">social class</xref> or geographic region can lay exclusive claim to Christian myth and legend; they fill the stanzas of royally sponsored poets, the visions of utopian philosophers, and the folklore of rural populations. Indeed, many ideas widely held about the workings of salvation (especially regarding the saints, angels, the devil, and the powers of nature) find their origin in legendary episodes rather than biblical text. Through myth and legend, communities across the globe have absorbed into their rich religious histories the message of Christian salvation and, through the same fabulous means, they have evaluated the impact of Christian temporal power on their world.

              <p>
                From the perspectives of history and sociology, the Christian community has been related to the world in diverse and even paradoxical ways. This is reflected not only in changes in this relationship over time but also in simultaneously expressed alternatives ranging from withdrawal from and rejection of the world to theocratic triumphalism. For example, early Christians so consistently rejected imperial deities that they were known as atheists, while later Christians so embraced European monarchies that they were known as reactionary theists. <xref refid="1775954" ty="1" topicid="216835" tocid="">Franciscans</xref>, especially the <xref refid="1775955" ty="1" topicid="560460" tocid="">Spiritual Franciscans</xref>, proclaimed that true Christians should divest themselves of money at the same time that the Catholic church erected magnificent churches and the clergy dressed in elaborate finery. Another classic example of this paradoxical relationship is provided by the monks, who withdrew from the world but also preserved and transmitted classical culture and learning to medieval Europe. In the modern period some Christian communities regard secularization as a fall from true Christianity; others view it as a legitimate consequence of a desacralization of the world initiated by Christ.
              </p>
              <p>The Christian community has always been part of the world in which it exists. It has served the typical religious function of legitimating social systems and values and of creating structures of meaning, plausibility, and compensation for society as it faces loss and death. The Christian community has sometimes exercised this religious function in collusion with tribalistic nationalisms (e.g., the “German Christians” and Nazism) by disregarding traditional church tenets. When the Christian community has held to its teachings, however, it has opposed such social systems and values. Given the inherent fragility of human culture and society, religion in general and the Christian community in particular frequently are conservative forces.</p>
              <p>
                However, the Christian community has not always been a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="133458" tocid="">conservative force</xref>. Twentieth-century black theology and Latin American <xref refid="1775956" ty="1" topicid="339237" tocid="">liberation theology</xref> shared the conviction that God takes the side of the oppressed against the world’s injustices. From the perspective of theology or faith, the criticism of the world of which the Christian community itself is a part is the exercise of its commitment to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. For the Christian community, the death and Resurrection of Jesus call into question all structures, systems, and values of the world that claim ultimacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The relationship of the Christian community to the world may be seen differently depending upon one’s historical, sociological, and theological perspectives because the Christian community is both a creation in the world and an influence upon it. This complexity led the American theologian <xref refid="1775959" ty="1" topicid="414555" tocid="">H. Richard Niebuhr</xref> to comment in <e>Christ and Culture</e> (1956) that “the many-sided debate about the relations of Christianity and civilization…is as confused as it is many-sided.”

              <headtitle>Church, sect, and mystical movement</headtitle>
              <p>
                The German scholar <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606217" tocid="">Ernst Troeltsch</xref> sought to impose a meaningful pattern on this confusion by organizing the complex relationships of the Christian community to the world into three types of religious social organization: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117086" tocid="">church</xref>, sect, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400861" tocid="">mystical movement</xref>. He described the church as a conservative institution that affirms the world and mediates salvation through clergy and sacraments. It is also characterized by inclusivity and continuity, signified by its adherence to infant baptism and historical creeds, doctrines, liturgies, and forms of organization. The objective-institutional character of the church increases as it relinquishes its commitment to eschatological perfection in order to create the <e>corpus Christianum</e>, the Christian commonwealth or society. This development stimulates opposition from those who understand the Gospel in terms of personal commitment and detachment from the world. The opposition develops into sects, which are comparatively small groups that strive for unmediated salvation and that are related indifferently or antagonistically to the world. The exclusivity and historical discontinuity of the sect is signified by its adherence to believers’ baptism and efforts to imitate what it believes is the New Testament community. Mystical movements are the expression of a radical religious individualism that strives to interiorize and live out the personal example of Jesus. They are not interested in creating a community but strive toward universal tolerance, a fellowship of spiritual religion beyond creeds and dogmas. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="378415" tocid="">Methodist Church</xref> exemplifies the dynamic of these types. The Methodist movement began as a sectarian protest against the worldliness of the Church of England; its success stimulated it to become a church, which in turn spawned various sectarian protests, including charismatic communities.
              </p>
              <p>Niebuhr further developed Troeltsch’s efforts by distinguishing five repetitive types of the Christian community’s relations to the world. Niebuhr’s types are: Christ against culture, Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox, and Christ the transformer of culture. The first two are expressions of opposition to and endorsement of the world, while the last three share a concern to mediate in distinctive ways the opposition between the first two.</p>
              <p>
                Opposition to the world is exemplified by <xref refid="1775960" ty="1" topicid="588511" tocid="">Tertullian’s</xref> question, “What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?” This sharp opposition to the world was expressed in the biblical disjunction between the children of God and the children of the world and between “the light” and “the darkness” (1 John 2:15, 4:4–5; Revelation); and it has continued to find personal exponents, such as <xref refid="1775961" ty="1" topicid="598700" tocid="">Leo Tolstoy</xref>, and communal expressions, such as the <xref refid="1775962" ty="1" topicid="277694" tocid="">Hutterites</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>Endorsement of the world emerged in the 4th century with the imperial legal recognition of Christianity by the Roman emperor Constantine. Although frequently associated with the medieval efforts to construct a Christian commonwealth, this type is present wherever national, social, political, and economic programs are “baptized” as Christian. Thus, its historical expressions may be as diverse as the Jeffersonian United States and Hitlerian Germany.</p>
              <p>
                The other three types that Niebuhr proposed are variations on the theme of mediation between rejection and uncritical endorsement of the world. The “Christ above culture” type recognizes continuity between the world and faith. This was probably best expressed by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>’s conviction that grace or the supernatural does not destroy nature but completes it. The “Christ and culture in paradox” type views the Christian community’s relationship to the world in terms of a permanent and dynamic tension in which the Kingdom of God is not of this world and yet is to be proclaimed in it. A well-known expression of this position is Martin Luther’s law–gospel dialectic, distinguishing how the Christian community is to live in the world as both sinful and righteous at the same time. The conviction that the world may be transformed and regenerated by Christianity (“Christ the transformer of culture”) has been attributed to expressions that have theocratic tendencies, such as those of Augustine and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="90247" tocid="">John Calvin</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>Efforts by scholars such as Troeltsch and Niebuhr to provide typical patterns of Christian relations to the world enable appreciation of the multiformity of these relationships without being overwhelmed by historical data. These models relieve the illusion that the Christian community has ever been monolithic, homogeneous, or static. This “many-sidedness” may be seen in the Christian community’s relationships to the state, society, education, the arts, social welfare, and family and personal life.</p>

                The relationship of Christians and Christian institutions to forms of the political order has shown an extraordinary diversity throughout church history. There have been, for example, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590558" tocid="">theocratically</xref> founded monarchies, democracies, and communist communities.

                In certain eras of church history the desire to establish the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref> stimulated political and social strivings. The political power of the Christian proclamation of the coming sovereignty of God resided in its promise of both the establishment of a kingdom of peace and the execution of judgment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The church, like the state, has been exposed to the temptation of power, which resulted in the transformation of the church into an ecclesiastical state. This took place in the development of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="441848" tocid="">Papal States</xref> and, to a lesser degree, in several theocratic churches, as well as in Calvin’s ecclesiastical state in Geneva in the 16th century. At times, too, the secular state declared itself Christian and the executor of the spiritual, political, and social commission of the church; it understood itself to be the representative of the Kingdom of God. This development took place in both the Byzantine and the Carolingian empires as well as in the medieval <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269851" tocid="">Holy Roman Empire</xref>.

                The struggle between the church, understanding itself as state, and the state, understanding itself as representative of the church, not only dominated the Middle Ages but also continued into the Reformation period. The wars of religion in the era of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation discredited in the eyes of many the theological and metaphysical rationales for a Christian state. The <xref refid="1775963" ty="1" topicid="22160" tocid="">Anabaptists</xref> in the 16th century and some <xref refid="1775964" ty="1" topicid="484034" tocid="">Puritans</xref> in the 17th century contributed to this skepticism by advocating religious liberty and rejecting the involvement of the state in religious matters.

                  </headtitle>
                  <p>The attitude of the first generations of Christians toward the existing political order was determined by the imminent expectation of the Kingdom of God, whose miraculous power had begun to be visibly realized in the figure of Jesus Christ. The importance of the political order was, thus, negligible, as Jesus himself asserted when he said, “My kingship is not of this world.” Orientation toward the coming kingdom of peace placed Christians in tension with the state, which made demands upon them that were in direct conflict with their faith.</p>
                  <p>This contrast was developed most pointedly in the rejection of the emperor cult and of certain state offices—above all, that of judge—to which the power over life and death was professionally entrusted. Although opposition to fundamental orderings of the ruling state was not based upon any conscious revolutionary program, contemporaries blamed the expansion of the Christian church in the Roman Empire for an internal weakening of the empire on the basis of this conscious avoidance of many aspects of public life, including military service.</p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the early Christian longing for the coming Kingdom of God, even the Christians of the early generations acknowledged the pagan state as the bearer of order in the world. Two contrary views thus faced one another within the Christian communities. On the one hand, under the influence of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Pauline</xref> missions, was the idea that the “ruling body”—i.e., the existing political order of the Roman Empire—was “from God…for your good” (Romans 13:1–4) and that Christians should be “subject to the governing authorities.” Another similar idea held by Paul (in 2 Thessalonians) was that the Roman state, through its legal order, “restrains” the downfall of the world that the Antichrist is attempting to bring about. On the other hand, and existing at the same time, was the apocalyptic identification of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="283884" tocid="">imperial city</xref> of Rome with the great whore of Babylon (Revelation 17:3–7). The first attitude, formulated by Paul, was decisive in the development of a Christian political consciousness. The second was noticeable especially in the history of radical Christianity and in radical Christian pacifism, which rejects cooperation as much in military service as in public judgeship.

                    In the political vacuum that arose in the West because of the invasion by the German tribes, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman church</xref> was the single institution that preserved in its episcopal dioceses the Roman provincial arrangement. In its administration of justice the church largely depended upon the old imperial law and—in a period of legal and administrative chaos—was viewed as the only guarantor of order. The Roman popes, most notably <xref refid="1775967" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Gregory I</xref> the Great (reigned 590–604), assumed many of the duties of the decadent imperial bureaucracy. Gregory negotiated with the Lombard kings of Italy, oversaw public welfare, and was the soldiers’ paymaster. His administrative skill helped lay the foundation for the Papal States, which emerged in the 8th century. Supporting papal claims and responsibilities was the so-called <xref refid="1775969" ty="1" topicid="454187" tocid="">Petrine theory</xref>—the idea that the pope was the representative of Christ and the successor of Peter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although he considered himself part of a Christian commonwealth headed by the emperor in Constantinople, Gregory sought to improve the religious life of the peoples of the West. Under him the church in Spain, Gaul, and northern Italy was strengthened, and England was converted to Roman Christianity. Later popes forged an alliance with the rulers of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="217113" tocid="">Frankish</xref> (Germanic) kingdom in the 8th century and succeeded in winning them as protectors of the Papal States when the Byzantine emperor was no longer able to protect Rome. The relationship created a new area of tension, as religious and secular leaders sought to define the exact nature of the relationship between them. From at least the time of Pope <xref refid="1775973" ty="1" topicid="227916" tocid="">Gelasius I</xref> (reigned 492–496), two powers, or swords, were recognized as having been established by God to rule. Carolingian rulers maintained that, as holders of one of the swords, they had special rights and duties to protect the church. Indeed, the emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="106546" tocid="">Charlemagne</xref> claimed for himself the right to appoint the bishops of his empire, who were thus increasingly involved in political affairs.
                  </p>
                  <p>Emperors in the 10th century, building on Carolingian precedent, continued to involve themselves in church affairs. As a result, bishops in the empire were sometimes also the reigning princes of their dioceses, and they were occasionally guilty of being more interested in the political than in the spiritual affairs of their dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                    These conflicting perspectives were the cause of a series of struggles between popes and secular rulers that began in the 11th century, when lay and religious leaders sought to reform society and the church. Already in the 10th century, monastic reform movements centred at Cluny, Gorze, and elsewhere had attempted to improve the religious life of the monks and establish a new understanding of ecclesiastical liberty. In the 11th century, reformers such as <xref refid="1775974" ty="1" topicid="453772" tocid="">Peter Damian</xref> and <xref refid="1775975" ty="1" topicid="276061" tocid="">Humbert of Silva Candida</xref> provided new definitions of the sins of clerical marriage and <xref refid="1775976" ty="1" topicid="545275" tocid="">simony</xref>. These intellectual developments, along with new decrees governing papal elections, led to the virtual elimination of secular interference in episcopal and papal succession. The staunchest supporter of these reforms, Pope <xref refid="1775978" ty="1" topicid="245604" tocid="">Gregory VII</xref>, ultimately banned the practice of the lay investiture of bishops and challenged the traditions of sacral kingship. Gregory’s assertion of papal authority, however, was opposed by the German ruler <xref refid="1775980" ty="1" topicid="261725" tocid="">Henry IV</xref>. Their conflict eventually burst into the great <xref refid="1775979" ty="1" topicid="292452" tocid="">Investiture Controversy</xref>, which became a struggle for supremacy between the church and the monarchy. The resolution of the controversy left the emperor in a weakened state and increased the influence of the secular and ecclesiastical princes.

                    Although the empire was reconstituted in the 12th century on the basis of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507759" tocid="">Roman law</xref> and the understanding of the empire as a distinct sacred institution (<e>sacrum imperium</e>), it broke down during the 13th century as the result of a new struggle between the emperors and several successive popes. The church, however, faced a new challenge in the rise of the European nation-states. Papal ideology had been shaped by the struggle with the emperors and thus was not suited to deal effectively with kings of nation-states. This first became clearly evident in the conflict between Pope <xref refid="1775982" ty="1" topicid="73067" tocid="">Boniface VIII</xref> and King <xref refid="1775983" ty="1" topicid="456170" tocid="">Philip IV</xref> of France over matters of ecclesiastical independence and royal authority. In 1296 Boniface issued a bull denying the king’s right to tax the clergy, which he withdrew because Philip forbade the clergy to send money to Rome and the pope needed the revenue. In 1301, Philip violated long-standing tradition by trying the bishop of Pamiers in a royal court. Boniface responded in 1302 with the bull <e>Unam Sanctam</e> (“One Holy Church”), the most extreme assertion by any pope of the supremacy of spiritual over secular authority. Revealing how much had changed since the time of Gregory VII, Philip rallied <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="482436" tocid="">public opinion</xref> against the pope, calling the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="193320" tocid="">Estates General</xref> to session to accuse Boniface of heresy, <xref refid="1775985" ty="1" topicid="646051" tocid="">witchcraft</xref>, sodomy, and other crimes. Philip’s adviser, <xref refid="1775986" ty="1" topicid="417141" tocid="">Guillaume de Nogaret</xref>, seized Boniface at Anagni, a town near Rome. Although the pope was rescued by local inhabitants, he died from the shock of the capture, and Philip emerged triumphant. Papal fortunes declined even further during the subsequent Babylonian Captivity of the church, when the papacy resided in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="45795" tocid="">Avignon</xref> (1309–77) and was perceived as being dominated by the French monarchy.

                    Secular control of the church increased during the <xref refid="1775987" ty="1" topicid="640848" tocid="">Great Schism</xref> (1378–1417), and in some parts of Europe it continued even after the schism ended. The schism was partly the result of growing demands for the papacy’s return to Rome. Pope <xref refid="1775988" ty="1" topicid="619401" tocid="">Urban VI</xref> settled in Rome and alienated a number of cardinals, who returned to Avignon and elected a rival pope, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="121053" tocid="">Clement VII</xref>. Popes and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="28501" tocid="">antipopes</xref> reigning simultaneously excommunicated each other, thus demeaning the papacy. The schism spread great uncertainty throughout Europe about the validity of the consecration of bishops and the sacraments as administered by the priests they ordained. It was perpetuated in part by European politics, as rival rulers supported either the pope in Rome or the pope in Avignon to assert ever greater authority over the church in their realms. The schism contributed to the rise of the 15th-century <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="131168" tocid="">conciliar movement</xref>, which posited the supreme authority of ecumenical councils in the church.

Under King <xref refid="1626628" ty="1" topicid="261947" tocid="">Henry VIII</xref> of England a revolutionary dissociation of the English church from papal supremacy took place. In the German territories the reigning princes became, in effect, the legal guardians of the Protestant churches—a movement already in the process of consolidation in the late Middle Ages. The development in the Catholic nation-states, such as Spain, Portugal, and France, occurred in a similar way.

These groups also renounced involvement with the state in certain respects, such as through military service and the holding of state offices; some of these groups attempted to structure their own form of common life in Christian, communist communities. Many of their political ideas—at first bloodily suppressed by the Reformation and Counter-Reformation states and churches—were later prominent in the Dutch wars of independence and in the English Revolution.

Subsequently, from the 17th century on, the tendency toward a new, natural-law conception of the relationship between state and church began to develop. Henceforth, in the Protestant countries, state sovereignty was increasingly emphasized vis-à-vis the churches. The state established the right to regulate educational and marriage concerns as well as all administrative affairs of the church. A similar development also occurred in Roman Catholic areas. In the second half of the 18th century <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="203255" tocid="">Febronianism</xref> demanded a replacement of papal centralism with a national church episcopal system; in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="44183" tocid="">Austria</xref> a state-church concept was established under Josephinism (after <xref refid="1775990" ty="1" topicid="306348" tocid="">Joseph II</xref> [reigned 1765–90]) through the dismantling of numerous ecclesiastical privileges. The <xref refid="1775991" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Eastern Orthodox</xref> Church also was drawn into this development under Peter the Great.

                    The separation of church and state was one of the legacies of the American and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="219315" tocid="">French revolutions</xref> at the end of the 18th century. It was achieved as a result of ideas arising from opposition to the English episcopal system and the English throne as well as from the ideals of the Enlightenment. It was implemented in France because of the social-revolutionary criticism of the wealthy ecclesiastical hierarchy but also because of the desire to guarantee the freedom of the church. The French state took over education and other functions of a civic nature that had been traditionally exercised by the church.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beginning in the late 18th century, two fundamental attitudes developed in matters related to the separation of church and state. The first, as implied in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="134197" tocid="">Constitution</xref> of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">United States</xref>, was supported by a tendency to leave to the church, set free from state supervision, a maximum freedom in the realization of its spiritual, moral, and educational tasks. In the United States, for example, a comprehensive <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="573803" tocid="">church school</xref> and educational system has been created by the churches on the basis of this freedom, and numerous colleges and universities have been founded by churches. The separation of church and state by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="219315" tocid="">French Revolution</xref> and later in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="614785" tocid="">Soviet Union</xref> and the countries under the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence was based upon an opposite tendency. The attempt was not only to restrict the public role of the church but also to work toward its gradual disappearance. The church was to be replaced with a secular ideology.

                  <p>
                    In contrast to this, the attitude of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="405414" tocid="">National Socialism</xref> in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="231186" tocid="">Germany</xref> under <xref refid="1775999" ty="1" topicid="267992" tocid="">Hitler</xref> was contradictory. On the one hand, Nazi ideology allowed no public role for the church and its teaching. On the other hand, Hitler was concerned not to trigger an outright confrontation with the church. The concordat concluded in 1933 between Germany and the Roman Catholic Church illustrates this policy of official neutrality.

                  <p>
                    In Germany state-church traditions had been largely eliminated in 1918 with the establishment of the <xref refid="1775998" ty="1" topicid="639027" tocid="">Weimar Republic</xref>; the abolition of the monarchical system of government also deprived the territorial churches of their supreme Protestant episcopal heads. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="639027" tocid="">Weimar</xref> Constitution sanctioned the separation of church and state. State-church traditions were maintained in various forms in Germany, not only during the Weimar Republic but also during the Hitler regime and afterward in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="231186" tocid="">Federal Republic of Germany</xref>. Thus, through state agreements, definite special rights, primarily in the areas of taxes and education, were granted to both the Roman Catholic Church and the Evangelical (Lutheran-Reformed) churches of the individual states.

                  <p>

He saw the empire and the imperial church as sharing a close bond with each other; in the centre of the Christian empire stood the figure of the Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="186034" tocid="">emperor</xref> rather than that of the spiritual head of the church.
                  </p>
                  <p>In Eusebian political theology, the Christian emperor appears as God’s representative on Earth in whom God himself “lets shine forth the image of his absolute power.” He is the “Godloved, three times blessed” servant of the highest ruler, who, “armed with divine armor cleans the world from the horde of the godless, the strong-voiced heralds of undeceiving fear of God,” the rays of which “penetrate the world.” Through the possession of these characteristics the Christian emperor is the archetype not only of justice but also of the love of humankind. When it is said about Constantine, “God himself has chosen him to be the lord and leader so that no man can praise himself to have raised him up,” the rule of the Orthodox emperor has been based on the immediate grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                    To a certain extent this understanding of the emperor was the Christian reinterpretation of the ancient Roman view of the emperor as the representative of god or the gods. Some of Eusebius’s remarks echo the cult of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="552806" tocid="">Unconquered Sun</xref>, Sol Invictus, who was represented by the emperor according to pagan understanding. The emperor—in this respect he also played the role of the <e>pontifex maximus</e> (high priest) in the state cult—took the central position within the church as well. He summoned the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="578481" tocid="">synods</xref> of bishops, “as though he had been appointed bishop by God,” presided over the synods, and granted judicial power for the empire to their decisions. He was the protector of the church who stood up for the preservation of unity and truth of the Christian faith and who fought not only as a warrior but also as an intercessor, as a second Moses during the battle against God’s enemies, “holy and purely praying to God, sending his prayers up to him.” The Christian emperor entered not only the political but also the sacred succession of the divinely appointed Roman emperor. Next to such a figure, an independent leadership of the church could hardly develop.

                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Orthodox</xref> theologians have understood the coexistence of the Christian emperor and the head of the Christian church as <e>symphōnia</e>, or “harmony.” The church recognized the powers of the emperor as protector of the church and preserver of the unity of the faith and asserted its own authority over the spiritual domain of preserving Orthodox doctrine and order in the church. The emperor, on the other hand, was subject to the church’s spiritual leadership as far as he was a son of the church.

                    </e>, the judicial ruling establishing this relationship of church and state.

                    </e> attempted to answer questions arising from the most painful event of his day: the sack of the city of Rome by the Visigoths in 410. Augustine responded to the shock and dismay his contemporaries experienced with the collapse of their world by delivering a literary demolition of paganism. From Augustine’s perspective the “splendid vices” of the pagans had led inexorably to the fall of an idolatrous world. In sharp contrast to this “earthly city,” epitomized by Rome but everywhere energized by the same human desires for praise and glory, Augustine projected the “most glorious city” of praise and thanks to God, the heavenly Jerusalem. However, Augustine did not simply identify the state with the earthly city and the church with the city of God. He perceived that the state existed not simply in opposition to God but as a divine instrument for the welfare of humankind. The <e>civitas dei</e> (“city of God”) and the <e>civitas terrena</e> (“earthly city”) finally correspond neither to church and state nor to heaven and earth. They are rather two opposed societies with antagonistic orders of value that intersect both state and church and in each case show the radical incompatibility of the love of God with the values of worldly society.

                  <p>
                    The historical development of the church in the Latin West took a different course from that of the Byzantine imperial church. In the West a new power gradually emerged—the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman church</xref>, the church of the bishop of Rome. This church assumed many of the administrative, political, and social-welfare functions of the ancient Roman state in the West following the invasion of the Germans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was in this context that the judicial pretense of the “Gift of the emperor Constantine”—the <xref refid="1776014" ty="1" topicid="133843" tocid="">Donation of Constantine</xref>—became possible, to which the later development of the papacy was connected. The Donation is the account of Constantine’s purported conferring upon Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="577628" tocid="">Sylvester I</xref> (reigned 314–335) of the primacy of the West, including the imperial symbols of rulership. The pope returned the crown to Constantine, who in gratitude moved the capital to Byzantium (Constantinople). The Donation thereby explained and legitimated a number of important political developments and papal claims, including the transfer of the capital to Byzantium, the displacement of old Rome by the new Rome of the church, papal secular authority, and the papacy’s separation from allegiance to the Byzantine empire and association with the rising power of the Latin West. The Donation, which was based on traditions dating to the 5th century, was compiled in the mid-8th century and is associated with the political transformation that took place in Italy at that time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was the point from which the developments in the East and in the West led in two different directions. The growing independence of the West was markedly illustrated by the <xref refid="643941" ty="1" topicid="450752" tocid="">Donation of Pippin</xref> (<xref refid="1776016" ty="1" topicid="450758" tocid="">Pippin</xref>, father of Charlemagne, was anointed king of the Franks by Pope Stephen III in 754), which laid the foundation of the Papal States as independent of any temporal power and gave the pope the Byzantine exarchate of Ravenna.

                  <p>
                    The idea of the church as a state also appeared in a democratic form and in strict contrast to its absolutist Roman model in some <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> church and sect developments and in Free churches of the post-Reformation period. The sects of the Reformation period renewed the old idea of the Christian congregation as God’s people, wandering on this Earth—a people connected with God, like Israel, through a special <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="141085" tocid="">covenant</xref>. This idea of God’s people and the special covenant of God with a certain chosen group caused the influx of theocratic ideas, which were expressed in forms of theocratic communities similar to states and led to formations similar to an ecclesiastical state. Such tendencies were exhibited among various Reformation groups (e.g., the Münster prophets), Puritans in Massachusetts, and groups of the American Western frontier. One of the rare exceptions to early modern theocratic theology was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351950" tocid="">Luther</xref>’s sharp distinction of political and ecclesial responsibilities by his dialectic of law and gospel. He commented that it is not necessary that an emperor be a Christian to rule, only that he possess reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The most recent attempt to form a church-state by a sect that understood itself as the chosen people distinguished by God through a special new revelation was undertaken by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or <xref refid="1776017" ty="1" topicid="392525" tocid="">Mormons</xref> as they are commonly known. Based on the prophetic direction of their leaders, they attempted to found the state Deseret, after their entrance into the desert around the Great Salt Lake in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="620518" tocid="">Utah</xref>. The borders of the state were expected to include the largest part of the area of the present states of Utah, California, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado. The Mormons, however, eventually had to recognize the fact that the comparatively small centre state, Utah, of the originally intended larger Mormon territory, could not exist as a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="590558" tocid="">theocracy</xref> (though structured as other secular models) under a government of Mormon Church leaders. Reports (some apparently spurious) by federal agents hostile to the church and widespread revulsion toward the Mormon practice of polygyny mitigated against federal sanction of the church leadership as the governmental heads of the proposed state. Utah eventually became a federal state of the United States.

                The development of Christianity’s influence on the character of society since the Reformation has been twofold. In the realm of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="193250" tocid="">state churches</xref> and territorial churches, Christianity contributed to the preservation of the status quo of society. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="700965" tocid="">England</xref>, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="187819" tocid="">Anglican Church</xref> remained an ally of the throne, as did the Protestant churches of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="231186" tocid="">German</xref> states. In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="513251" tocid="">Russia</xref> the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="513815" tocid="">Orthodox Church</xref> continued to support a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551478" tocid="">social order</xref> founded upon the monarchy, and even the monarch carried out a leading function within the church as protector.

              <p>
                Though the impulses for transformation of the social order according to the spirit of the Christian ethic came more strongly from the Free churches and state and territorial churches made positive contributions in improving the status quo. In 17th- and 18th-century Germany, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran</xref> clergy, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="216914" tocid="">August Francke</xref> (1663–1727), were active in establishing poorhouses, orphanages, schools, and hospitals. In England, Anglican clerics, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="370088" tocid="">Frederick Denison Maurice</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="318730" tocid="">Charles Kingsley</xref> in the 19th century, began a Christian <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551335" tocid="">social movement</xref> during the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="287086" tocid="">Industrial Revolution</xref> that brought Christian influence to the conditions of life and work in industry. Johann Hinrich Wichern proclaimed, “There is a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115206" tocid="">Christian Socialism</xref>,” at the Kirchentag Church Convention in Wittenberg [Germany] in 1848, the year of the publication of the <e>Communist Manifesto</e> and a wave of revolutions across Europe, and created the “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499001" tocid="">Inner Mission</xref>” in order to address “works of saving love” to all suffering spiritual and physical distress. The diaconal movements of the Inner Mission were concerned with social issues, prison reform, and care of the mentally ill.

                The Anglo-Saxon <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="218180" tocid="">Free churches</xref> made great efforts to bring the social atmosphere and living conditions into line with a Christian understanding of human life. Methodists and Baptists addressed their message mainly to those segments of society that were neglected by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="193250" tocid="">established church</xref>. They recognized that the distress of the newly formed working class, a consequence of industrialization, could not be removed by the traditional charitable means used by the state churches. In Germany, in particular, the spiritual leaders of the so-called revival movement, such as Friedrich Wilhelm Krummacher (1796–1868), denied the right of self-organization to the workers by claiming that all earthly social injustices would receive compensation in heaven caused <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367265" tocid="">Karl Marx</xref> and <xref refid="1776018" ty="1" topicid="187483" tocid="">Friedrich Engels</xref> to separate themselves completely from the church and its purely charitable attempts at a settlement of social conflicts and to declare religion with its promise of a better beyond as the “opiate of the people.” This reproach, however, was as little in keeping with the social-ethical activities of the Inner Mission and of Methodists and Baptists as it was with the selfless courage of the Quakers, who fought against social demoralization, against the catastrophic situation in the prisons, against war, and, most of all, against slavery.

                </headtitle>
                <p>
                  Christian approaches to slavery have passed through many controversial phases. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> recommended to Philemon that he accept back his runaway slave Onesimus “no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother…both in the flesh and in the Lord” (verse 16); the passage does not reject slavery but stresses that masters must treat their slaves humanely. Although the biblical writings made no direct attack upon the ancient world’s institution of slavery, its proleptic abolition in community with Christ—“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="223802" tocid="">Galatians</xref> 3:28)—has been a judgment upon the world’s and the Christian community’s failure to overcome slavery and all forms of oppression. Most scholars assume that the eschatological assumptions of the apostolic community—that the return of Jesus and thus the end of time were imminent—rendered social issues secondary. As it became evident that Jesus’ return was not imminent and as the early church made its place in the world, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Fathers</xref> began to address social issues, and they identified slavery as the just punishment for sin. However, they also emphasized the need to treat slaves justly and maintained that Christians could not be enslaved. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="380873" tocid="">Medieval society</xref> made slow progress in the abolition of slavery, but by the year 1000 slavery had essentially disappeared in much of Western Europe, and by about 1100 it had been replaced by serfdom. One of the special tasks of the orders of knighthood was the liberation of Christian slaves who had fallen captive to the Muslims; and special knightly orders were even founded for the ransom of Christian slaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the discovery of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="20369" tocid="">New World</xref>, the institution of slavery grew to proportions greater than had been previously conceived. The widespread conviction of the Spanish conquerors of the New World that its inhabitants were not fully human, and therefore could be enslaved, added to the problem. The importation of African slaves to North America was supported by various Christian churches, including the Anglican, which predominated in Virginia and other British colonies. Into the 18th century, African slaves were described as bearing the mark of Cain, and other scriptural passages were used to support slavery. When some churches began to champion abolition in the 19th century, churches in the American South continued to find support for the institution in the Bible.

But well before Anselm, Christians maintained that because people have been endowed with reason, they have an urge to express their experience of faith intellectually, to translate the contents of faith into concepts, and to formulate beliefs in a systematic understanding of the correlation between God, humankind, and creation. This desire was exemplified by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="308822" tocid="">Justin Martyr</xref>, a professional philosopher and Christian apologist of the 2nd century who saw Christian revelation as the fulfillment, not the elimination, of philosophical understanding.

                <p>The attitude that had been hostile toward intellectual endeavours was heard less frequently after the Christian church had become the church of the Roman Empire. But the relationship between science and theology was attacked when the understanding of truth that had been developed within theology was turned critically against the dogma of the church itself. This occurred, for instance, after the natural sciences and theology had turned away from total dependence upon tradition and directed their attention toward experience—observation and experiment. A number of fundamental dogmatic principles and concepts were thus questioned and eventually abandoned. The struggle concerning the theory of evolution has been a conspicuous modern symptom of this trend.</p>
                <p>
                  The estrangement of theology and natural science in the modern period was a complex development related to confessional controversies and wars in the 16th and 17th centuries and philosophical perspectives in the 18th and 19th centuries. The epistemological foundation of faith was radically challenged by the Scottish philosopher <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="276139" tocid="">David Hume</xref>. Building upon Hume’s work, the German philosopher <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="311398" tocid="">Immanuel Kant</xref> advocated freedom from any heteronomous authority, such as the church and dogmas, that could not be established by reason alone. Scholars withdrew from the decisions of church authorities and were willing to subject themselves only to critical reason and experience. The rationalism of the Enlightenment appeared to be the answer of science to the claim of true faith that had been made by the churches.

                <p>
                  The Christian church created the bases of the Western system of education. From its beginning the Christian community faced external and internal challenges to its faith, which it met by developing and utilizing intellectual and educational resources. The response to the external challenge of rival religions and philosophical perspectives is termed apologetics—i.e., the intellectual defense of the faith. Apologetic theologians from Justin Martyr in the 2nd century to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="595850" tocid="">Paul Tillich</xref> in the 20th have promoted critical dialogue between the Christian community, the educated world, and other religions. This exchange was further encouraged by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Second Vatican Council</xref>, Pope John Paul II, and the ecumenical movement. The internal challenges to the Christian community were met not only by formulating the faith in creeds and dogmas but also by passing this faith on to the next generations through education.

                <p>
                  By the 8th and 9th centuries, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="99562" tocid="">cathedral schools</xref> were established to provide basic education in Latin grammar and Christian doctrine to the clergy, and by the 11th century these schools emerged as centres of higher learning. The school at the court of Charlemagne (which was conducted by clergy), the medieval schools of the religious orders, cathedrals, monasteries, convents, and churches, the flourishing schools of the Brethren of the Common Life, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic</xref> school systems that came into existence during the Counter-Reformation under the leadership of the Jesuits and other new teaching orders contributed much to the civilization of the West. Equally important were the schools started by the German Reformers Luther, <xref refid="1776232" ty="1" topicid="373644" tocid="">Philipp Melanchthon</xref>, Johann Bugenhagen, John and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="216914" tocid="">August Hermann Francke</xref>, and the Moravian reformers <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="127493" tocid="">John Amos Comenius</xref> and the graf von Zinzendorf. The church was responsible for overseeing schools even after the Reformation. Only in the 18th century did the school system start to separate itself from its Christian roots and fall more and more under state control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the separation of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref>, both institutions have entered into tensely manifold relationships. In some countries the state has taken over the school system and does not allow private church schools except in a few special cases. Other countries (e.g., France) maintain school systems basically free of religion and leave the religious instruction to the private undertakings of the different churches. In the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="616563" tocid="">American</xref> Revolution the concept of the separation of state and church was intended to free the church from all patronization by the state and to make possible a maximum of free activity, particularly in the area of education. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="614785" tocid="">Soviet Union</xref> used its schools particularly for an anti-religious education based upon the state philosophy of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="161209" tocid="">dialectical materialism</xref>, practicing the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of anti-religious propaganda in schools, though the churches were forbidden to give any education outside their worship services.
                </p>
                <p>A second issue that results from the separation of church and state is the question of state subsidies to private church schools. These are claimed in those countries in which the church schools in many places take over part of the functions of the state schools (e.g., in the United States). After the ideological positivism and the materialism of the 19th century faded away in many areas, it was realized that religious life had an important role in the cultural development of the West and the New World and that the exclusion of religious instruction from the curricula of the schools indicated a lack of balance in education. In the 20th century religion was adopted as a subject among the humanities. State universities in the United States, Canada, and Australia, which did not have theological faculties because of the separation of church and state, founded departments of religion of an interdenominational nature and included non-Christians as academic teachers of religion.</p>
                <p>
                  Another development in the history of Christian education was the founding of universities. The origins of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="618194" tocid="">university</xref> can be traced to the 12th century, and by the 13th century the medieval university had reached its mature form. Universities were founded during the rest of the Middle Ages throughout Europe and spread from there to other continents after the 16th century. The earliest universities emerged as associations of masters or students (the Latin <e>universitas</e> means guild or union) that were dedicated to the pursuit of higher learning. The universities, which superseded the cathedral schools as centres of advanced study, came to have a number of shared traits: the teaching methods of lecture and disputation, the extended communal living in colleges, the periodically changing leadership of an elected dean, the inner structure according to faculties or “nations,” and the European recognition of academic degrees. Universities provided instruction in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="339020" tocid="">liberal arts</xref> and advanced study in the disciplines of law, medicine, and, most importantly, theology. Many of the great theologians of the era, notably, Thomas Aquinas, were associated with the universities.

                <p>
                  The advent of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275932" tocid="">humanism</xref> and the Reformation, as well as the reforms initiated by some university faculty, created a new situation for all systems of education, especially the universities. Humanists demanded plans to provide designated places for free research in academies that were princely or private institutions and, as such, not controlled by the church. On the other hand, Protestant states and principalities founded new universities, such as Marburg in 1527, Königsberg in 1544, and Jena in 1558. As a counteraction, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302999" tocid="">Jesuits</xref> took over the leadership in the older universities that had remained Roman Catholic or else founded new ones in Europe and overseas.

                <p>
                  In areas of missionary work, Christian education has had a twofold task. First, its function was to lay an educational foundation for evangelization of non-Christian peoples by forming a system of education for all levels from grammar school to university. Second, its function was to take care of the education of European settlers. To a large extent the European colonial powers had left the formation of an educational system in their colonies or dominions to the churches. In the Spanish <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="126237" tocid="">colonial</xref> regions in America, Roman Catholic universities were founded very early (e.g., Santo Domingo in 1538, Mexico and Lima in 1551, Guatemala in 1562, and Bogotá in 1573). In China, Jesuit missionaries acted mainly as agents of European education and culture (e.g., astronomy, mathematics, and technology) in their positions as civil servants of the court.

                  Since the 18th century, the activities of competing Christian denominations in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="385426" tocid="">mission</xref> areas has led to an intensification of the Christian system of education in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="38479" tocid="">Asia</xref> and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="7924" tocid="">Africa</xref>.

                  In <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">North America</xref>, Christian education took a different course. From the beginning, the churches took over the creation of general educational institutions, and various denominations did pioneer work in the field of education. In the English colonies, later the United States, the denominations founded theological colleges for the purpose of educating their ministers and established universities dealing with all major disciplines, including theology, often emphasizing a denominational slant. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="256300" tocid="">Harvard University</xref> was founded in 1636 and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="651384" tocid="">Yale University</xref> in 1701 as Congregational establishments, and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="644208" tocid="">College of William and Mary</xref> was established in 1693 as an Anglican institution. They were followed during the 19th century by other Protestant universities (e.g., <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="556801" tocid="">Southern Methodist University</xref>, Dallas, Texas) and colleges (e.g., <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42889" tocid="">Augustana College</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="506162" tocid="">Rock Island</xref>, Illinois) and by Roman Catholic universities (e.g., the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="420717" tocid="">University of Notre Dame</xref>, Notre Dame, Indiana) and colleges (e.g., <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="74888" tocid="">Boston College</xref>, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts). In addition, many private universities were based upon a Christian idea of education according to the wishes of their founders.

                  Christian education has been undertaken in a variety of forms. The system of Sunday schools is nearly universal in all denominations. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="132040" tocid="">Confirmation</xref> instruction is more specialized, serving different tasks, such as preparation of the children for confirmation, their conscious acknowledgment of the Christian ethic, of the Christian confessions, of the meaning of the sacraments, and of the special forms of congregational life.

                  <headtitle>Healing the sick</headtitle>
                  <p>The Christian church has responded to the matter of human illness both by caring for and healing the sick and by expressing concern for them. The practice of healing has retreated into the background in modern times, but healing played a decisive role in the success of the early church and was important in missionary apologetics. In the Gospels, Jesus appears as a healer of body and soul. The title “Christ the Physician” was the most popular name for the Lord in missionary preaching of the first centuries. Even the Apostles are characterized as healers. The Apologists of the 2nd to 4th century used numerous miraculous healings as arguments for the visible presence of the Holy Spirit in the church. The Fathers of the first centuries interpreted the entire sphere of charismatic life from the basic concepts that Christ is the physician, the church the hospital, the sacraments the medication, and orthodox theology the medicine chest against heresy. Ignatius of Antioch called the Eucharist the “medication that produces immortality.” Healing within the church began to retreat only in connection with the transformation of the church into a state church under Constantine and with the replacement of free charismatics by ecclesiastical officials.</p>
                  <p>
                    The early basis for healing was generally a demonological interpretation of sickness: healing was often carried out as an <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="198273" tocid="">exorcism</xref>—that is, a ceremonial liturgical adjuration of the demon that was supposed to cause the illness and its expulsion from the sick person. The development of exorcism is characteristic in that the office of the exorcist eventually became one of the lower levels of ordination, which led to the priesthood. During the Enlightenment in the 18th century, the practice of exorcisms within the Roman Catholic Church was suppressed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the Protestant churches, exorcism never completely vanished; in Pietistic circles exorcists such as Johann Christoph Blumhardt the Elder (1805–80) have appeared. With the motto “Jesus is Conquerer,” Blumhardt transformed his healing centre at Bad Boll in Germany, into an influential resource for international missionary work. His son, Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt (1842–1919), continued his father’s work and in sympathy with working-class needs entered politics as a member of the Württemberg Diet. Since the latter part of the 19th century, different groups of the Pentecostal and charismatic movements have revived the use of exorcistic rituals with great emphasis and—pointing to the power of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref>—they claim the charisma of healing as one of the spiritual gifts granted the believing Christian. After the basic connection between healing of the body and healing of the soul and the psychogenic origin of many illnesses was acknowledged theologically and medically, different older churches, such as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479856" tocid="">Protestant Episcopal Church</xref> and even the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, have reinstituted healing services.

                    In terms of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="200569" tocid="">spiritual healing</xref>, one church has stood out in this respect. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178916" tocid="">Mary Baker Eddy</xref> (1821–1910), the founder of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115181" tocid="">Christian Science</xref>, referred particularly to healing through the Spirit as her special mission.

This service was not limited to members of the Christian congregation but was directed toward the larger community, particularly in times of pestilence and plague.

                    Beginning in the 4th century, the monasteries created a new institution, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="272626" tocid="">hospital</xref>, and continued to care for the sick throughout the Middle Ages. The growing number of pilgrims to the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439645" tocid="">Holy Land</xref> and the necessity of care of their numerous sick, who had fallen victim to the unfamiliar conditions of climate and life, led to knightly hospital orders, the most important of which was the Order of the Hospital of St. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="305089" tocid="">John of Jerusalem</xref> (later called the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="320392" tocid="">Knights of Malta</xref>), founded in the 11th century. The service for the sick, which was carried out by the knights alongside their military service for the protection of the pilgrims, was not elaborate.

Other hospitals were founded as autonomous institutions under the leadership or supervision of a bishop. The centralization of the different existing institutions became necessary with the growth of cities and was most frequently undertaken by city councils. The laity began to take over, but the spiritual and pastoral care of the patients remained a major concern.

                    In Protestant lands during the Reformation, medieval <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="422718" tocid="">nursing</xref> institutions were adapted to new conditions. The church constitutions in the different territories of the Reformation stressed the duty of caring for the sick and gave suggestions for its adequate realization. The office of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="154196" tocid="">deacon</xref> was supplemented by that of the deaconess. The Counter-Reformation brought a new impulse for caring for the sick in the Roman Catholic Church, insofar as special orders for nursing service were founded—e.g., the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="106528" tocid="">Daughters of Charity</xref>, a non-enclosed congregation of women devoted to the care of the sick and the poor, founded by Vincent de Paul, a notable charismatic healer.

Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers all had a great share in this development, founding numerous hospitals throughout the world and supplying them with willing male and female helpers. German Lutheranism was influenced by these developments. In 1823 Amalie Sieveking developed a sisterhood analogous to the Daughters of Charity and was active in caring for the cholera victims of the great Hamburg epidemic of 1831. She was an inspiration to Theodor Fliedner, who founded the first Protestant hospital in Kaiserswerth in 1836 and created at the same time the female diaconate, an order of nurses that soon found worldwide membership and recognition. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="415020" tocid="">Florence Nightingale</xref> received training at Kaiserswerth, which was an important model for modern nursing schools.

                    Church hospitals and ecclesiastical nursing care maintained a leading role in the 20th century, although along with the general political and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="551304" tocid="">social development</xref> of the 19th century the city or communal hospital was founded and overtook the church hospital.

                <p>The church had founded orphanages during the 4th century, and the monasteries took over this task during the Middle Ages. They also fought against the practice of abandoning unwanted children and established foundling hospitals. In this area, as in others, a secularization of church institutions took place in connection with the spreading autonomy of the cities. In Protestant churches the establishment of orphanages was furthered systematically. In Holland almost every congregation had its own orphanage, which was sustained through the gifts of the members.</p>

                  The Christian community’s response to the questions of property, poverty, and the poor may be sketched in terms of four major perspectives, which have historically overlapped and sometimes coexisted in mutuality or contradiction. The first perspective, both chronologically and in continuing popularity, is personal charity. This was the predominant form of the church’s relationship to the poor from the 1st to the 16th century. The second perspective supplements the remedial work of personal charity by efforts for preventive welfare through structural <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="550924" tocid="">changes in society</xref>. This concern to remove causes of poverty was clearly expressed in the Reformation but was soon submerged in the profound sociopolitical and economic changes of the time. The third perspective is a retreat into the charity models of the earlier Christian community. Because of the overwhelming effects of the process of secularization and the human misery caused by industrialization, the key to social welfare was expressed in the Pietist maxim that social change depended upon the conversion of individuals. The fourth perspective, present in churches of the modern period, envisions systemic social change to facilitate redistribution of the world’s <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="638235" tocid="">wealth</xref>. Personal charity is not neglected, but the primary goal is to change the unjust structures of world society.

                  <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42902" tocid="">Augustine</xref>’s doctrine of charity became the heart of Christian thought and practice. Augustine portrayed the Christian pilgrimage toward the heavenly city by analogy to a traveler’s journey home. The city of God, humankind’s true home, is characterized by the love of God even to the contempt of self, whereas the earthly city is characterized by the love of self even to the contempt of God. It is the goal—not the journey—that is important. The world and its goods may be used for the journey, but if they are enjoyed they direct the traveler away from God to the earth. This imagery incorporates into Christian theology the great themes of pilgrimage, renunciation, alienation, and asceticism; and the biblical and early Christian suspicion of riches receives systematic theological articulation. Pride and covetousness are the major vices; humility and almsgiving are the major virtues; and poverty is endorsed as the favoured status for the Christian life.

                <p>
                  This view did not, however, lead to a rejection of property and its importance for society. Although <xref refid="1776237" ty="1" topicid="245696" tocid="">Gregory of Nazianzus</xref> (<e>c.</e> 330–<e>c.</e> 389) linked private property to the Fall, he understood that the abolition of private property would not cure sin. Property and wealth should be shared, not relinquished. Yet the paradox of 2 Corinthians 6:10 remained: How could a Christian be poor yet make many rich, have nothing yet possess everything? The answers given were communal property, charity to the needy, avoidance of avarice, and concentration upon heavenly treasure. The solutions of institutionalizing poverty in priesthood and monasticism, while rationalizing poverty as poverty of the spirit and material wealth as God’s provision for ministry, formed the basis for medieval care of the poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most influential medieval thinker on the problem of property was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="31211" tocid="">Thomas Aquinas</xref>, who saw community of goods as rooted in natural law because it makes no distinction of possessions. The natural law of common use protects every person’s access to earthly goods and requires responsibility by everyone to provide for the needs of others. Private property, on the other hand, is rooted in positive law through human reason. Reason leads to the conclusion that the common good is served if everyone has disposition of his own property because there is more incentive to work, goods are more carefully used, and peace is better preserved when all are satisfied with what they have. Private property exists to serve the common good; thus, superfluous property is to be distributed as alms to the needy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other major effort to deal with property and poverty at this time was through rational direction and administration. As cities developed into political corporations, a new element entered welfare work: an organizing citizenry. Through their town councils, citizens claimed the authority to administer the ecclesiastical welfare work of hospitals and poor relief. The process was accelerated by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformers</xref>, whose theology undercut the medieval idealization of poverty. According to the Reformers, righteousness before God was by faith alone, and salvation was perceived as the foundation of life rather than its goal. Thus, the Reformation community found it difficult to rationalize the plight of the poor as a peculiar form of blessedness, and no salvific value either in being poor or in giving alms could be identified. When the Reformers turned to poor relief and social welfare, their new theological perspectives led them to raise questions of social justice and social structures. This was codified in Protestant church legislation in the “common chest,” which spread throughout Europe from its origin in Wittenberg. The common chest—funded by church endowments, offerings, and taxes—was the community’s financial resource for providing support to the poor, orphans, the aged, the unemployed, and the underemployed through subsidies, low-interest loans, and gifts.

                  In the 16th and 17th centuries Christian leaders, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, served the poor while ignoring the root causes of poverty. In the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the social institutions of Pietism, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="499001" tocid="">Inner Mission</xref>, and European revival movements inspired social concern for the masses of people pauperized and proletarianized by industrialism. The Methodists in England undertook <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="6610" tocid="">adult education</xref>, schooling, reform of prisons, abolition of slavery, and aid to alcoholics. Famous missions arose in Basel, London, and Paris. The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA; 1844), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="654151" tocid="">Young Women’s Christian Association</xref> (YWCA; 1855), and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="520053" tocid="">Salvation Army</xref> (1865) were only some of the numerous charitable institutions and organizations created to alleviate modern ills. In 1848 Johann Wichern, founder of the Inner Mission, proclaimed that “love no less than faith is the church’s indispensable mark.”
                </p>
                <p>Yet this Christian social concern hardly was aware of and rarely attempted to expose the origins of the social ills it strove to remedy. Wichern himself was aware that poverty is social, not natural, but his orientation, like that of others, was toward renewing society through evangelization. This attitude—that society is changed by changing the hearts of individuals—is still prevalent.</p>
                <p>
                  In the second half of the 20th century, however, the Christian community, especially in its ecumenical organizations, began to analyze the social problems of property and poverty from the standpoint of justice and the perspectives of the poor and oppressed. In 1970 the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref> (WCC) established the Commission for the Churches’ Participation in Development (CCPD). Initially involved in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178361" tocid="">development</xref> programs and the provision of technical services, the CCPD focus shifted to the psychological and political character of the symbiosis of development and underdevelopment. This focus was endorsed at the 1975 WCC Assembly at Nairobi, Kenya, as “a liberating process aimed at justice, self-reliance and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178400" tocid="">economic growth</xref>.” Other church bodies, such as the Lutheran World Federation and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, shared this perspective. There was also the sense that the biblical themes of justice and liberation entail the creation of social structures to enhance human life, economic structures for the just distribution of goods, and political structures to promote participation and minimize dependence. This attitude is well reflected in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="339237" tocid="">liberation theology</xref>, which was popular in segments of the Roman Catholic Church from the 1970s to the 1990s. Seeking to apply the faith by aiding the poor and oppressed, primarily in developing countries, advocates of liberation theology established local “base camps” to study the Bible and to address the economic needs and political interests of poor communities.

                <headtitle>Pastoral care</headtitle>
                <p>Pastoral care has always been of special importance in the Christian community. The biographies of the great charismatic ministers, beginning with the Fathers of the Eastern Church and the Western Church, testify to surprising variations of this pastoral care. The principal interest of pastoral care—whether exercised by clergy or laity—is the personal welfare of persons who are hurt, troubled, alienated, or confused within. The historical expressions of pastoral care have focused on the predominant—but not exclusive—expressions of ultimate concern characteristic of the period in question. Ignatius, for example, addressed the terror of death when he termed the sacrament “the medicine of immortality”; Luther responded to the conscience tortured by guilt and uncertainty by proclaiming the free forgiveness of sin by grace alone, apart from human accomplishment; and the modern Christian community has utilized the insights of psychology and psychiatry in developing pastoral counseling and therapy responsive to modern anxieties. Fundamentally, however, pastoral care has always attempted to respond to the totality of human needs in every age in consonance with the words of Jesus Christ: “I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me” (Matthew 25:35–36).</p>
                <p>
                  One of the most important contributions to pastoral care after the New Testament was by Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="245549" tocid="">Gregory I the Great</xref>. His <e>Pastoral Care</e>, written after he became bishop of Rome in 590, was so influential that it became customary to present it to new bishops upon their ordination. This textbook of the medieval episcopate emphasized the role of the pastor as shepherd of souls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The medieval institutionalization of pastoral care in the sacrament of penance led to certain deficits in practice: the exclusion of the laity by emphasis upon the central role of the priest and the distortion of its original spiritual purposes of prayer, repentance, and forgiveness of sins by the introduction of paid indulgences. The indulgence abuse sparked the Reformation critique of the sacrament of penance. This in turn led to the Reformers’ emphasis upon lay as well as clerical responsibility for pastoral care as expressed in their teaching of “the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="475966" tocid="">priesthood of all believers</xref>.” The Reformation insistence upon justification by grace alone shifted the burden of proof for salvation from human accomplishment to divine promise. By “letting God be God,” the Reformers claimed that persons were free to be human. This shift of theological focus, from an otherworldly achievement to a this-worldly trust in God, facilitated a renewed holistic awareness of human needs.

                In some countries Christian minorities have had to struggle for their existence and recognition, at times in the face of persecution. In some cases, however, the situation of Christian minorities is ideally suited to demonstrate to outsiders the peculiar style of life of a Christian culture. This is particularly advantageous for the church within a caste state, in which the church itself has developed into a caste, with special extrinsic characteristics in clothing and customs (e.g., the Mar Thoma <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="556252" tocid="">Church of South India</xref>).

                A special problem presents itself through the coexistence of racially different Christian cultures in racially mixed states.

                The Christian church has always urged the overcoming of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="488187" tocid="">racism</xref>, even though it has generally compromised with prevailing societal values. In the early church, racism was unknown; the Jewish synagogues allowed black proselytes.

Likewise, the early congregations in Alexandria included many black Africans. Among the evangelizing churches, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="471439" tocid="">Portuguese</xref> Catholic mission in principle did not recognize differences between races—whoever was baptized became a “human being” and became a member not only of the Christian congregation but also of the Christian society and was allowed to marry another Christian of any race. In contrast to this practice, the Catholic mission of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="557573" tocid="">Spaniards</xref> introduced the separation of races under the term <e>casticismo</e> (purity of the Castilian heritage) in the American mission regions and sometimes restricted marriage between Castilian Spanish immigrants and native Christians.

              <p>Consequently, the Christian churches both led and thwarted endeavours for racial integration.

                The Christian understanding of sexuality, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="366152" tocid="">marriage</xref>, and family has been strongly influenced by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> view of marriage as an institution primarily concerned with the establishment of a family, rather than sustaining the individual happiness of the marriage partners. In spite of this, a transformation occurred from the early days of Christianity. This transformation is evident in the New Testament departure from the Hellenistic understanding of love. The classical understanding of love, expressed in the Platonic concept of eros, was opposed in the Christian community by the biblical understanding of love, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="106513" tocid="">agape</xref>. Although erotic love has frequently been understood primarily as sexual desire and passion, its classical religious and philosophical meaning was the idealistic desire to acquire the highest spiritual and intellectual good. The early Christian perception of eros as the most sublime form of egocentricity and self-assertion, the drive to acquire the divine itself, is reflected in the fact that the Greek New Testament does not use the word <e>erōs</e> but rather the relatively rare word <e>agapē</e>. <e>Agapē</e> was translated into Latin as <e>caritas</e> and thus appears in English as “charity” and “love.” The Christian concept of love understood human mutuality and reciprocity within the context of God’s self-giving love, which creates value in the person loved. “We love, because he first loved us. If any one says, ‘I love God,’ and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also” (1 John 4:19–21). Love is presented as the greatest of the virtues (1 Corinthians 13:13) as well as a commandment. The Christian community understood faith active in love primarily in terms of voluntary obedience rather than emotion and applied this understanding to every aspect of life, including sexuality, marriage, and family.

                <headtitle>The tendency to spiritualize and individualize marriage</headtitle>
                <p>
                  Christianity has contributed to a spiritualization of marriage and family life, to a deepening of the relations between marriage partners and between parents and children. During the first decades of the church, congregational meetings took place in the homes of Christian families. The family, indeed, became the archetype of the church. Paul called the members of his congregation in Ephesus “members of the household of God” (Ephesians 2:19). In the early church, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="111148" tocid="">children</xref> were included in this fellowship. They were baptized when their parents were baptized, took part in the worship life of the congregation, and received <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="194799" tocid="">Holy Communion</xref> with their parents. The Eastern Orthodox Church still practices as part of the eucharistic rite Jesus’ teaching, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early church the Christian foundation of marriage—in the participation of Christians in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">body of Christ</xref>—postulated a generous interpretation of the fellowship between a Christian and a pagan marriage partner: the pagan one is saved with the Christian one “for the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband”; even the children from such a marriage in which at least one partner belongs to the body of Christ “are holy” (1 Corinthians 7:14). If the pagan partner, however, does not want to sustain the marriage relationship with a Christian partner under any circumstances, the Christian partner should grant the spouse a divorce.
                </p>
                <p>Jesus himself based his parables of the Kingdom of God on the idea of love between a bride and groom and frequently used parables that describe the messianic meal as a wedding feast. In Revelation the glorious finale of salvation history is depicted as the wedding of the Lamb with the bride, as the beginning of the meal of the chosen ones with the Messiah–Son of Man (Revelation 19:9: “Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb”). The wedding character of the eucharistic meal is also expressed in the liturgy of the early church. It is deepened through the specifically Christian belief that understands the word of the creation story in Genesis “and they become one flesh” as indicative of the oneness of Christ, the head, with the congregation as his body. With this in mind the Christian demand of monogamy becomes understandable.</p>
                <p>Christianity did not bring revolutionary social change to the position of women, but it made possible a new position in the family and congregation. In the ancient Mediterranean world, women were often held in low esteem, and this was the basis for divorce practices that put women practically at men’s complete disposal. By preaching to women and prohibiting divorce, Jesus himself did away with this low estimation of women. The decisive turning point came in connection with the understanding of Christ and of the Holy Spirit. In fulfillment of the prophecy in Joel 2:28—according to Peter in his sermon on Pentecost (Acts 2:17)—the Holy Spirit was poured out over the female disciples of Jesus, as well.</p>
                <p>
                  This created a complete change in the position of women in the congregation: in the synagogue the women were inactive participants in the worship service and sat veiled on the women’s side, usually separated from the rest by an opaque lattice. In the Christian congregation, however, women appeared as members with full rights, who used their charismatic gifts within the congregation. In the letters of Paul, women are mentioned as Christians of full value. Paul addresses Prisca (Priscilla) in Romans 16:3 as his fellow worker. The four daughters of Philip were active as prophets in the congregation. Pagan critics of the church, such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="470723" tocid="">Porphyry</xref> (<e>c.</e> 234–<e>c.</e> 305), maintained that the church was ruled by women. During the periods of Christian persecution, women as well as men showed great courage in their suffering. The fact that they were honoured as martyrs demonstrates their well-known active roles in the congregations.
                </p>
                <p>The attitude toward women in the early church, however, was ambivalent at best. Paul, on the one hand, included women in his instruction, “Do not quench the Spirit” (1 Thessalonians 5:19), but, on the other hand, carried over the rule of the synagogue into the Christian congregation that “women should keep silence in the churches” (1 Corinthians 14:34). Although women were respected for their piety and could hold the office of deaconess, they were excluded from the priesthood. In the early 21st century the Roman Catholic Church still refused to ordain women as priests.</p>

                  In the light of the beginning Kingdom of God, marriage was understood as an order of the passing eon, which would not exist in the approaching new age. The risen ones will “neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven” (Mark 12:25). Similarly, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> understood marriage in the light of the coming Kingdom of God: “The appointed time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none…for the form of this world is passing away” (1 <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="137622" tocid="">Corinthians</xref> 7:29–31). In view of the proximity of the Kingdom of God, it was considered not worthwhile to marry; and marriage was seen to involve unnecessary troubles: “I want you to be free from anxieties” (1 Corinthians 7:32). Therefore, the unmarried, the widowers, and widows “do better” if they do not marry, if they remain single. But according to this point of view marriage was recommended to those who “cannot exercise self-control…for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion” (1 Corinthians 7:9). With the waning of the eschatological expectation that formed the original context for the Pauline views on marriage, his writings were interpreted ascetically. While these texts have been used alone in the course of church history, however, they do not stand alone in the New Testament, which also portrays marriage feasts as joyous occasions and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="537163" tocid="">sexual intercourse</xref> between spouses as good and holy (Ephesians 5:25–33).

At the council of Elvira, in 300–303 or 309, the first decrees establishing clerical celibacy were pronounced, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries prominent Christians such as Anthony, Ambrose, and Jerome adopted chastity. The celibate lifestyle came to be regarded as a purer and more spiritual way of life.

This solution has saved the Eastern Orthodox from a permanent fight for the demand of celibacy for all clergymen, but it has resulted in a grave separation of the clergy into a white (celibate) and a black (married) clergy, which led to severe disagreements in times of crisis within Orthodoxy.

                  The early Christian community’s attitude to <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="66704" tocid="">birth control</xref> was formed partly in reaction against sexual exploitation and infanticide and partly against the Gnostic denigration of the material world and consequent hostility to procreation. In upholding its faith in the goodness of creation, sexuality, marriage, and family, the early church was also influenced by the prevalent Stoic philosophy, which emphasized procreation as the rational purpose in marriage.

                <p>
                  In the 20th century the question of birth control entered a new phase with the invention and mass distribution of mechanical <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="135259" tocid="">contraceptive</xref> devices on the one hand and through the appearance of a new attitude toward sexual questions on the other. The various Christian churches responded to this development in different ways: with a few exceptions—e.g., the Mormons—the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="479892" tocid="">Protestant</xref> churches accepted birth control in terms of a Christian social ethic. In contrast, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholic Church</xref>, in the encyclical of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="462393" tocid="">Pius XI</xref> <e>Casti Connubii</e> (1930; “On Christian Marriage”) and in the encyclical of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446981" tocid="">Paul VI</xref> <e>Humanae Vitae</e> (1968; “On Human Life”), completely rejected any kind of contraception, a position confirmed by Paul’s successors as pope in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Modern economic and population concerns in connection with improved medical care and social and technological progress have once again confronted the Christian community with the issue of contraception.

                </headtitle>
                <p>
                  The main <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="587032" tocid="">commandment</xref> of the Christian ethic was derived from the Old Testament: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="338002" tocid="">Leviticus</xref> 19:18), but Jesus filled this commandment with a new, twofold meaning. First, he closely connected the commandment “love your neighbour” with the commandment to love God. In the dispute with the scribes described in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref>, chapter 22, he quoted <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="159740" tocid="">Deuteronomy</xref> 6:5, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.” He spoke of the commandment of love for neighbour, however, as being equal to it. With that he lifted it to the same level as the highest and greatest commandment, the commandment to love God. In The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="351073" tocid="">Gospel According to Luke</xref>, both commandments have grown together into one single pronouncement with the addition: “Do this, and you will live.” Second, the commandment received a new content in view of God and in view of the neighbour through the relationship of the believer with Christ. Love of God and love of the neighbour is possible because the Son proclaims the Gospel of the Father and brings to it reality and credibility through his life, death, and Resurrection. Based on this connection of the Christian commandment of love with the understanding of Christ’s person and work, the demand of love for the neighbour appears as a new commandment: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">John</xref> 13:34). The love for each other is supposed to characterize the disciples: “By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is based on an understanding and treatment of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref> as created in the image of God. Furthermore, the ethic does not deal with humanity in an abstract sense but with the actual neighbour. The Christian ethic understands the individual always as a neighbour in Christ.
                </p>
                <p>The new element of the Christian ethic is the founding of the individual ethic in a corporate ethic, in the understanding of the fellowship of Christians as the body of Christ. The individual believer is not understood as a separate individual who has found a new spiritual and moral relationship with God but as a “living stone” (1 Peter 2:4), as a living cell in the body of Christ in which the powers of the Kingdom of God are already working.</p>
                <p>Christian love leads to the peculiar exchange of gifts and suffering, of exaltation and humiliations, of defeat and victory; the individual is able through personal sacrifice and suffering to contribute to the development of the whole. All forms of ecclesiastical, political, and social communities of Christianity are founded on this basic idea of the fellowship of believers as the body of Christ. It also has influenced numerous secularized forms of Christian society, even among those that have forgotten or denied their Christian origins.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, the commandment contains a certain tension concerning the answer to the question: Does it refer only to fellow Christians or to “all”? The practice of love of neighbour within the inner circle of the disciples was a conspicuous characteristic of the young church. In Christian congregations and, above all, in small fellowships and sects throughout the centuries, love of the neighbour was highly developed in terms of personal pastoral care, social welfare, and help in all situations of life.</p>
                <p>The Christian commandment of love, however, has never been limited to fellow Christians. On the contrary, the Christian ethic crossed all social and religious barriers and saw a neighbour in every suffering human being. Characteristically, Jesus himself explicated his understanding of the commandment of love in the parable of the Good Samaritan, who followed the commandment of love and helped a person in need whom a priest and a Levite had chosen to ignore (Luke 10:29–37). A demand in the Letter of James, that the “royal law” of neighbourly love has to be fulfilled without “partiality” (James 2:9), points to its universal validity.</p>
                <p>
                  The universalism of the Christian command to love is most strongly expressed in its demand to love one’s enemies. Jesus himself emphasized this with these words: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="369708" tocid="">Matthew</xref> 5:44–45). According to this understanding, love of the enemy is the immediate emission of God’s love, which includes God’s friends and God’s enemies.

A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.” The second sentence expressed the theme of Christian vocation developed by Luther and Calvin, which they applied to all Christians and to everyday responsibility for the neighbour and for the world. The Reformers emphasized that Christian service is not limited to a narrow religious sphere of life but extends to the everyday relationships of family, marriage, work, and politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later Protestantism under the influence of Pietism and Romanticism restricted the social and communal orientation of the Reformers to a more individualistic orientation. This met, however, with an energetic counterattack from the circles of the Free churches (e.g., Baptists and Methodists) who supported the social task of Christian ethic (mainly through the Social Gospel of the American theologian <xref refid="1776522" ty="1" topicid="492192" tocid="">Walter Rauschenbusch</xref>, who attempted to change social institutions and bring about a Kingdom of God), which spread through the whole church, penetrating the area of Christian mission. Love rooted in faith played an important role in the 20th century in the struggle between Christianity and ideologies such as Fascism, Communism, and jingoistic nationalisms.

            <p>In the early 21st century, about one-third of the world’s people claimed the Christian faith. Christians thus constituted the world’s largest religious community and embraced remarkable diversity, with churches in every nation. Christianity’s demographic and dynamic centre had shifted from its Western base to Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region, where more than half the world’s Christians lived. This trend steadily accelerated as the church declined in Europe. The global extent of Christianity represented a new phenomenon in the history of religions. This was the fruit of mission.</p>

Jesus’ prayer in The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="304610" tocid="">Gospel According to John</xref> includes the words “As thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.… [I pray also] for those who believe in me through their word, that they may all be one…so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me” (John 17:18, 20–21).

              <p>The Christian mission, the church, and Christianity—each distinguishable, but inseparably related—have experienced four major transitions in their history.</p>
              <h4 tocid="67611">
                <headtitle>
                  First transition, to <e ty="s">ad</e> 500
                </headtitle>
                <p>
                  The new missionary faith made its first major transition as it emerged from Palestine and spread throughout the Mediterranean world. The apostle <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="447019" tocid="">Paul</xref> became the missionary to the Gentile world. With help from Barnabas and a local network of coworkers, many of them women, he evangelized <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22897" tocid="">Asia Minor</xref> and southern Greece and eventually reached Rome. Dominated politically by the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507866" tocid="">Roman</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507905" tocid="">Empire</xref>, the new religion benefited from the stability the empire provided and the language its elite shared—common, or <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="321153" tocid="">koine</xref>, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="244768" tocid="">Greek</xref>. Alexandrian Jews had <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="64500" tocid="">translated</xref> (250 <e ty="s">bce</e>) the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="259039" tocid="">Hebrew Bible</xref> into koine Greek for dispersed Greek-speaking Jews. The New Testament writers also wrote in koine Greek. In that largely literate empire early Christians used and widely distributed the Hebrew Scriptures.
                </p>
                <p>Several factors brought growth to the faith. From the beginning laypeople—both men and women—conducted the largest part of mission. Congregations grew in homes used as churches. Although the house was owned by the husband, the wife was its mistress, and women throughout the empire opened their homes to newly forming churches. Most evangelization occurred in the daily routine as men and women shared their faith with others. Christianity’s monotheism, morality, assurance of eternal life with God, and ancient Scriptures attracted many to the faith.</p>
                <p>
                  Christians daily encountered members of other religions—Gnosticism and the mystery and philosophical cults. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries external and internal pressures drove the young church to strengthen itself through creating a structured ministry, formulating beliefs in creeds, and producing a canon of Scripture. That process established critical institutions for the early Christian movement. The major thrust of the early church-mission sprang from the conviction that Christians and congregations were fulfilling a mission and ministry begun in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref>. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="52311" tocid="">Baptism</xref> provided induction into the vibrant company of “God’s own people” (1 Peter 2:9–10), which many in the empire gradually accepted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rome, however, declared Christianity an illegal religion, in part because Christians refused to engage in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="186034" tocid="">emperor</xref> worship, and persecutions ensued. In the persecutions so many Christians bore witness (Greek: <e>
                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="367142" tocid="">martyria</xref>
                  </e>) that the word martyr quickly evolved into its current meaning. Christian faith—not least that of young women such as Blandina, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="452499" tocid="">Perpetua</xref>, and Felicity—made an impact, and many who beheld that witness became Christian. In 313 when the new emperor, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="133873" tocid="">Constantine</xref>, declared the persecutions ended, Christians probably constituted 10 percent of the empire’s population.
                </p>
                <p>By 315 many who saw advantage in belonging to Constantine’s new faith poured into the churches. The result was striking: small congregations of convinced Christians serving God’s outreach in the world became large churches with many nominal members whose instruction and needs had to be met. As multitudes entered the churches, the need for outreach to others was much reduced, and most churches shifted from an outward thrust to an inward focus upon themselves. Mission and service became the province of priests, deacons, and, increasingly, monks.</p>
                <p>
                  At the same time, mission beyond the frontiers of the empire continued. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="613200" tocid="">Ulfilas</xref> (<e>c.</e> 311–<e>c.</e> 382), Arian bishop and apostle to the Goths, translated the Bible into their tongue.

In Malabar, South India, a church of ancient tradition, demonstrably present since the 3rd century, held the apostle <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115623" tocid="">Thomas</xref> to be its founder. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="221140" tocid="">Frumentius</xref> (d. <e>c.</e> 380) from Tyre evangelized in Ethiopia and became the first patriarch of its church.

                </p>
                <p>
                  In its first 500 years Christianity achieved remarkable missionary and theological acculturation. Through the first four ecumenical councils (325–451), and in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref> (on the Trinity) and Definition of Chalcedon (on Christology), the church had stated its faith with meaning for the Greek and Latin worlds.

                <p>By the close of the period Jerome’s Latin translation of the Bible, the Vulgate, had appeared, and Christianity had become the official religion of the empire. The first great transition of the Christian mission—from Judaic Palestine to the Mediterranean world—had ended.</p>

                <p>
                  Rome’s urban and literate world quickly disappeared under the barbarians’ westward onslaught. These conquerors established themselves as the new ruling elite; however, they recognized in missionary monks the bearers of a new faith and preservers of a higher civilization. The mission thrust of these monks contrasted sharply with that of the tiny persecuted church in the first three centuries. Then, except for the conversions of the city-state of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="522584" tocid="">Edessa</xref>, in <e ty="s">ad</e> 200, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="35178" tocid="">Armenia</xref>, declared a Christian nation in <e ty="s">ad</e> 300, people joined the new faith individually.

                    In the 15th century European nations began a process of exploration and colonization that brought them more fully into contact with the rest of the world and facilitated the spread of Christianity.

In 1494, following Columbus’s successful voyages for Spain, the pope granted Spain all territory west of 47° W longitude (eastern Brazil). Under royal patronage (<e>patronato real</e>, or <e>padroado</e>), monarchs of both nations accepted responsibility for evangelizing the newly found peoples. Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, and, from 1542, Jesuits staffed the resulting missions. Finally, by 1600, other great powers, including France and the Protestant countries of England, Holland, and Denmark, began to establish and evangelize overseas empires.

                    Despite its weaknesses, the Roman Catholic mission gained vast numbers for the faith as Franciscans and Dominicans traveled widely and built mission churches. Although limits were placed on the ordination of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="405873" tocid="">Native Americans</xref> and much evangelization appeared to be an integral part of military conquest, the indigenous and mestizo populations of Mexico and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="555844" tocid="">South America</xref>, who intermingled traditional and Christian beliefs, thought of themselves as Roman Catholics.

The Scottish Missionary Society (1796) and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409956" tocid="">Netherlands</xref> Missionary Society (1797) soon appeared. Anglican evangelicals organized the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117209" tocid="">Church Missionary Society</xref> (1799), and many others followed. Like the SPCK and SPG, they were founded not by churches but as autonomous societies supported chiefly by denominational constituencies. Similarly, in Europe these organizations were usually created geographically—such as the Basel (1815), Berlin (1824), and Leipzig (1836) societies.

In 20th-century “overseas” missions, English-speaking participants represented from 80 to 89 percent, and North Americans about 67 percent, of all Protestant missionaries.

Their greatest impact was in the production of vast corps of able and educated women, especially in Asia, who played major roles in the professions and in church leadership.</p>

                      Missionaries also returned to China and other parts of East Asia in the 19th century. Following the Opium Wars of 1842–44 and 1858–60, China was opened to Westerners. Although there had been a Roman Catholic presence in China since the 16th-century Jesuit mission, the arrival of Christianity in the 19th century had a profound impact on Chinese culture and history. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="580815" tocid="">Taiping Rebellion</xref> (1850–64), which nearly toppled the Qing, or Manchu, dynasty and took an estimated 20 million lives, was led by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="276586" tocid="">Hong Xiuquan</xref>, who was influenced by Christian teachings and thought that he was Jesus’ younger brother. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="76364" tocid="">Boxer Rebellion</xref> of 1899–1900 brought death to thousands of Chinese Christians and several hundred missionaries.

                      Christianity’s fortunes in the second half of the 20th century were mixed. The Chinese government expelled all missionaries in 1950–51, confiscated churches, and brought pressure on Christians. During the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="146249" tocid="">Cultural Revolution</xref> (1966–76) no churches or other religious bodies could operate. Christians continued to exist in China, but they suffered grievously. From 1976, as the government allowed some churches to open, Christians reemerged throughout the country. Roman Catholic and Protestant churches were filled, and in varied ways “silent” house-churches testified that the underground church had been dynamically growing. In the early 21st century the church in China, despite persecution and lingering tensions between the Vatican and the Chinese government, is considerably larger and stronger than it was in 1949.

Unlike other Asian countries, Korea did not experience Christianity’s arrival with Western imperialism but rather saw that faith as reinforcing Korean nationalism against Japanese imperialism from 1910 to 1945. Christian evangelization in Korea enabled the church to grow in less than a century to about one-third of the country’s population.

                    <p>Protestants discovered the need for cooperation and unity. As tiny minorities in lands of other religions, new Christians and missionaries together saw that denominational separatism hindered evangelization. Four streams led to the cooperation and unity reflected in the World Missionary Conference (WMC) held in Edinburgh in 1910. First, missionary “field” conferences affirmed comity (separation of spheres of work), cooperation in Bible translation and missionary councils, and shared sponsorship in major enterprises such as hospitals and colleges. A second stream involved missionary conferences in England and the United States from 1854 to 1900. A third force flowed through the missionary concern of the international student Christian and missionary movements. The fourth stream arose in the West from continuing interdenominational conferences of mission leaders to face common concerns and forge common policies. Among others, these included the Continental European Missions Conference (1866) and the Foreign Missions Conference of North America (1893).</p>

                      The Edinburgh conference was unique—a landmark and watershed for all that was to follow. Largely Western in membership, but with 17 Asian delegates, it created a Continuation Committee that in 1921 became the International Missionary Council (IMC).

                    Nondenominational faith missions viewed J. Hudson Taylor’s China Inland Mission (1865; after 1965 called the Overseas Missionary Fellowship) as the great prototype. Missions such as these often sought to work in areas unoccupied by other missionaries, guaranteed no salaries, and left financial support in God’s hands; but most bodies made their financial needs known to a wide constituency. Their chief aim has been to proclaim the Gospel and eschew the provision of social services. These societies joined together in the Interdenominational Foreign Mission Association (IFMA; 1917). Since the 1960s they have cooperated with the Evangelical Foreign Missions Association (EFMA; 1945), the missionary arm of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="404471" tocid="">National Association of Evangelicals</xref> (1943), and, at the international level, with the World Evangelical Fellowship (1952).

Since the 1960s IFMA has worked on a variety of projects with the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, and in the late 20th century it addressed a variety of social issues, including an educational program concerned with AIDS, as part of its mission.

                <p>
                  During the third transition, Christianity had spread worldwide from a base in Europe. As a result of the fourth transition, more Christians lived in Asia, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="437647" tocid="">Pacific Islands</xref>, Africa, and Latin America than in the old Christendom, part of a long-term, continuing shift in Christianity’s numerical and vivifying centre.

                </p>
                <p>The growth of the world Christian community kept pace with the 20th-century population explosion, and in the fastest-growing areas the growth rate in numbers of Christians was almost three times greater than the general population increase. The majority of the world’s Christians lived in non-Western nations: a universal Christian church had come into being.</p>
                <p>In this transition two issues were especially prominent. First, the church found itself engaged with those of traditional or new religions and those for whom ideologies had become religions. In that setting the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox and Protestants in the World Council of Churches affirmed evangelization to be essential but also engaged in dialogue with other religions to promote better understanding between the different faiths. This effort brought with it much dissent and tension.</p>
                <p>
                  Second, “<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="592508" tocid="">Third World</xref> theologies” often provoked angry debate. The underlying questions concerned the identification of what was essentially Christian in Western Christianity and theology and whether Western church structures and theologies were universally normative. But the most basic question asked how Christians of all races could manifest unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another force was the worldwide growth in the number of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="450414" tocid="">Pentecostals</xref> and charismatics. They formed new churches, appeared in traditional churches, and found outlet in many nonwhite indigenous bodies.

They forced theological reflection—perhaps best developed by Roman Catholics—on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and on authority within the church.

Theologically it set itself within the dynamics of the faith’s fourth transition. The council’s Decree on the Church’s Missionary Activity (<e>Ad Gentes</e>) built theologically on the council’s foundational document, the “Dogmatic Constitution on the Church” (<e>Lumen Gentium;</e> “Light of the Nations”), which insisted upon evangelization but presented a larger understanding of God’s grace for those outside the church, and urged missionaries to pursue dialogue.

                  After <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Vatican II</xref> the situation changed, as the very definition of missionary activity was transformed and the duties of all Christians to undertake evangelical work was emphasized. The new evangelism emphasized the importance of bearing witness to Christ, which includes efforts to spread the Gospel and to promote the church’s teachings on human dignity. The former missionary churches were placed more and more in the hands of local peoples, and the bishops in regional councils took over leadership of evangelization formerly held by missionary orders. In the decades following Vatican II, the church’s mission was conducted with greater sensitivity toward other cultures, and church leaders emphasized interreligious dialogue. In 1986 Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="305139" tocid="">John Paul II</xref> invited world religious leaders to Assisi to pray for peace, and he subsequently prayed at a synagogue and a mosque. The pope offered further guidance on missions in his encyclical <e>Redemptoris missio</e> (December 7, 1990; “The Mission of Christ the Redeemer”), renewing the church’s commitment to mission and calling for the evangelization of lapsed Christians and non-Christians alike.

                  The translation of the Holy Scriptures has constituted a basic part of mission. During the Middle Ages few could read the Latin Bible, and vernacular versions of the Bible, in part or whole, appeared at times throughout the period. The most important of these was the so-called Wyclif Bible, an English translation compiled in 1382. Within 80 years of the invention of printing in the West, however, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="495422" tocid="">Reformation</xref> leaders such as Luther and Calvin focused on the Word of God. Their cardinal principle remained that each should be able to read the Bible in his own tongue. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="477067" tocid="">printing press</xref> greatly aided Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism used it effectively as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Translations of the Bible became more numerous and widespread beginning in the 16th century. One of the earliest and most important was Luther’s German translation. The first official Roman Catholic translation of the Bible, the Douai-Rheims Bible, appeared in two stages: in 1582, the New Testament was published, and in 1609–10, the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref> appeared. In 1611, the most influential English Bible, the <xref refid="1776543" ty="1" topicid="318454" tocid="">King James Version</xref>, was published at the commission of James I. Modern English translations were produced in the 20th century by Roman Catholic and Protestant scholars. Translations into other European languages were first made in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in the 19th century Holy Scripture was translated into various African and Asian languages.
                </p>
                <p>In the 20th century printed Christian Scriptures became available in the mother tongues of almost 99 percent of the world’s people. That unprecedented accomplishment marks the greatest achievement in the history of written communications. Bibles were available in nearly 325 languages, complete New Testaments in nearly 700 languages, and some portion of the Scriptures in 1,800 other languages. The translation effort, most of which has occurred during the past 200 years, has in many cases reduced a language to writing for the first time. The effort involved the production of grammars and dictionaries of these languages as well as scriptural translations, and an additional benefit has been the written preservation of the cultural heritage by native speakers of the language.</p>
                <p>Bible societies, including the United Bible Societies (1946), have coordinated and aided the translation work of missionaries in this task for almost 200 years. Wycliffe Bible Translators (1936) concentrated its work among the language groups having the smallest numbers of speakers. From 1968, Roman Catholics and the United Bible Societies have coordinated their efforts and cooperated in translation and production wherever possible.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
              In later centuries the word <e ty="i">ecumenical</e> was used to denote church councils (e.g., Nicaea, Chalcedon) whose decisions represented the universal church, in contrast to other councils that enjoyed only regional or limited reception. The honorary title of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178827" tocid="">ecumenical patriarch</xref> was given to the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople in the 6th century because his see was located in the capital of the <e>oikoumenē</e> and his leadership was accepted as primus inter pares (first among equals) in the faith and mission of the whole church. The Apostles’, the Nicene, and the Athanasian creeds are called ecumenical because they witness to the faith of all Christians. Since the 19th century the term <e>ecumenism</e> has denoted the movement of the renewal, unity, and mission of Christians and churches of different traditions “so that the world may believe.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ecumenism is a vision, a movement, a theology, and a mode of action. It represents the universality of the people of God and affects the way Christians think about their faith, the church, and the world. Ecumenism is a long process that draws Christians together, uniting their life and mission and bringing the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">Body of Christ</xref> and the human community closer to the fulfillment of God’s purposes. Those involved in ecumenism participate in ideas, activities, and institutions that express a spiritual reality of shared love in the church and the human community. Ecumenism is characterized by the work of officially organized ecumenical bodies, the confessing and witnessing of Christians in local places, and the spirituality and actions of those who live together in love and prophetic proclamation. Far more than a program or an organization, ecumenism is, according to the British ecumenist Oliver S. Tomkins, “something that happens to the soul of Christians.”
            </p>
            <p>Any unity worthy of this vision cannot be identified with political or spiritual coercion, strategies of dominance or superiority, calls for “a return to the mother church,” or expectations of monolithic uniformity or a super-church. The weapons of faith are not those of force or intolerance; neither can divisions be overcome nor authentic unity manifested by syncretism, a least-common-denominator theology, or a casual friendliness. Ecumenism accepts the diversity of God’s people, given in creation and redemption, and strives to bring these confessional, cultural, national, and racial differences into one fully committed fellowship.</p>
            <p>
              Ultimately the purpose of ecumenism is to glorify the triune God and to help the one missionary church to witness effectively and faithfully among all peoples and nations. In the second half of the 20th century Christians confessed new dimensions of this vocation, especially in relation to what divides the churches. Progress was made on historical theological issues that have divided Christians through the centuries—baptism, the Eucharist, and ministry. But equally divisive among Christians are the divisions of the human family: racism, poverty, sexism, war, injustice, and differing ideologies. These issues are part of the agenda of ecumenism and bring a particular context, dynamic spirit, and urgency to the pursuit of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="178836" tocid="">Christian unity</xref> as well as of justice and peace. The church’s unity becomes essential for the renewal and unity of the human family. Through its unity the church becomes a sign, the first fruits of the promised unity and peace among God’s peoples and the nations.

              <headtitle>The biblical perspective</headtitle>
              <p>
                The unity of the church and of all creation is a dominant motif in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="64396" tocid="">Bible</xref>. This witness begins in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="427211" tocid="">Old Testament</xref>, or Hebrew Scriptures, not the New Testament. As attested in the Bible, God established a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="141085" tocid="">covenant</xref> with the Hebrew people and gathered the disparate tribes into one religious nation, Israel, taking steps to overcome the alienation between God and humans and to reconcile God’s people. The tradition of ancient <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="307197" tocid="">Judaism</xref>, therefore, was based on the reality of the one people of God. Their unity was an expression of their monotheistic faith, the oneness of God (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="651183" tocid="">Yahweh</xref>). According to Genesis, God created the world as one cosmos, an ordered unity determined by one single will in which all creatures are responsive to the purposes of the Creator. Yahweh chose Israel from all the nations of the world and entered into covenant with its people. Whenever men and women sinned and alienated themselves from God and from one another, God acted to bring about their reconciliation. Israel’s mission was to preserve the faithfulness and unity of all God’s people and to prepare them for the realization of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="236611" tocid="">Kingdom of God</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision of unity is central to the Gospel of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="303091" tocid="">Jesus Christ</xref> and the teachings of his Apostles. Those who confess Jesus as Lord and Saviour are brought together in a new community: the church. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="412114" tocid="">New Testament</xref> writers assumed that to be “in Christ” is to belong to one fellowship (Greek: <e>koinōnia</e>). Jesus clearly gave the mandate when at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="331170" tocid="">Last Supper</xref> he offered his high-priestly intercession, praying that the disciples and all those who believe in him “may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee…so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me” (John 17:21). This unity was demonstrated in the miracle of Pentecost (Acts 2) and other actions that established the primitive church—e.g., the epoch-making <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302865" tocid="">Council of Jerusalem</xref> (Acts 15), which negotiated conflicts between Jewish and Gentile Christians.
              </p>
              <p>The early church nevertheless had many tensions and conflicts that called for ecumenical proclamations and pleas from the Evangelists and Apostles. Tensions arose between Jewish Christian churches and Gentile Christian churches, between Paul and the enthusiasts. Peter and Paul disagreed strongly over whether Gentiles had to fulfill Jewish requirements in order to be welcome at the Lord’s Supper (Eucharist). As revealed in the New Testament, the young church clearly faced the challenge of theological aberrations: Colossians refutes Gnosticism; the Johannine Epistles warn against Docetism; 2 Peter and Revelation attack false prophets.</p>
              <p>
                Diversity, however, did not create schism nor allow a break in fellowship. There were no denominations or divided communities, as were to develop later in the church’s history. Division among Christians is a denial of Christ, an unthinkable distortion of the reality of the church. Amid their diversity and conflicts the early Christians remained of “one accord,” visibly sharing the one Eucharist, accepting the ministries of the whole church, reaching out beyond their local situation in faith and witness with a sense of the universal community that held all Christians together. As Paul taught the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="189551" tocid="">Ephesians</xref>, God’s ultimate will and plan is “to unite all things in him [Christ], things in heaven and things on earth” (chapter 1, verse 10).

                While unity is given in Christ, two diametric forces appear in the history of the church. One is the tendency toward sectarianism and division; the other is the conviction toward catholicity and unity. Ecumenism represents the struggle between them. Some of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="527428" tocid="">schisms</xref> were theological conflicts foreshadowed in the apostolic church; others were internal quarrels related to liturgical differences, power politics between different patriarchates or church centres, problems of discipline and piety, or social and cultural conflicts. Nevertheless, according to the American historian John T.

                  A long and continuing trail of broken relations among Christians began in the 2nd century when the Gnostics presented a serious doctrinal error and broke fellowship. Quartodecimanism, a dispute over the date of Easter, pitted Christians from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="22897" tocid="">Asia Minor</xref> against those from Rome. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="390561" tocid="">Montanism</xref>—which taught a radical enthusiasm, the imminent <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="531409" tocid="">Second Coming</xref> of Christ, and a severe perfection, including abstinence from marriage—split the church. The Novatians broke fellowship with Christians who offered sacrifices to pagan gods during the persecutions of the Roman emperor <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="155162" tocid="">Decius</xref> in <e ty="s">ad</e> 250.

They remained a powerful force in Africa into the 5th century and survived into the 7th despite opposition from <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117123" tocid="">church and state</xref>. This schism—like many since—reflected regional, national, cultural, and economic differences between the poor, rural North African Christians and the sophisticated, urban Romans.

                <p>
                  In each century leaders and churches sought to reconcile these divisions and to manifest the visible unity of Christ’s church. But in the 5th century a severe break in the unity of the church took place. The public issues were doctrinal consensus and heresy, yet in the midst of doctrinal controversy alienation was prompted by political, cultural, philosophical, and linguistic differences. Tensions increased as the church began to define the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="115761" tocid="">relationship</xref> between God the Father and God the Son and later the relation between the divine and human elements in the nature and person of Jesus Christ. The first four ecumenical councils—at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413817" tocid="">Nicaea</xref> (<e ty="s">ad</e> 325), Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431), and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="104580" tocid="">Chalcedon</xref> (451)—defined the consensus to be taught and believed, articulating this faith in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="413955" tocid="">Nicene Creed</xref> and the Chalcedonian Definition, which stated that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, true man, and true God, one person in “two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.” Some groups deviated doctrinally from the consensus developed in the councils. The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="409819" tocid="">Nestorians</xref> taught that there are two distinct persons in the incarnate Christ and two natures conjoined as one. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="389961" tocid="">Monophysites</xref> taught that there is one single nature, primarily divine. Several churches refused to accept the doctrinal and disciplinary decisions of Ephesus and Chalcedon and formed their own communities. These pre-Chalcedonian or non-Chalcedonian churches, including the Oriental Orthodox churches, became great missionary churches and spread to Africa and throughout Central, South, and East Asia.

                <p>
                  The greatest schism in church history occurred between the church of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="177174" tocid="">Constantinople</xref> and the church of Rome. While 1054 is the symbolic date of the separation, the agonizing division was six centuries in the making and the result of several different issues. The Eastern church sharply disagreed when the Western church introduced into the Nicene Creed the doctrine that the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="269934" tocid="">Holy Spirit</xref> proceeds not from the Father alone—as earlier <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="117198" tocid="">Church Fathers</xref> taught—but from the Father and the Son (Latin: <e>
                    <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="206865" tocid="">Filioque</xref>
                  </e>). When the Roman Empire was divided into two zones, Latin-speaking Rome began to claim superiority over Greek-speaking Constantinople; disputes arose over church boundaries and control (for example, in Illyricum and Bulgaria). Rivalry developed in Slavic regions between Latin missionaries from the West and Byzantine missionaries from the East, who considered this territory to be Orthodox. Disputes over authority became even more heated in the 11th century as Rome asserted its primacy over all churches. Lesser matters related to worship and church discipline—for example, married clergy (Orthodox) versus celibacy (Roman Catholic) and rules of fasting and tonsure—strained ecclesial relations. The tensions became a schism in 1054, when the uncompromising patriarch of Constantinople, <xref refid="1776546" ty="1" topicid="379884" tocid="">Michael Cerularius</xref>, and the uncompromising envoys of Pope <xref refid="1776545" ty="1" topicid="336247" tocid="">Leo IX</xref> excommunicated each other. No act of separation was at this time considered final by either side. Total alienation came a century and a half later, as a result of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="144695" tocid="">Crusades</xref>, when Christian knights made military campaigns to save Jerusalem and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439645" tocid="">Holy Land</xref> from the Muslims. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade was diverted to attack and capture Constantinople brutally. Thousands of Orthodox Christians were murdered; churches and icons were desecrated and undying hostility developed between East and West.

                <p>
                  Even so, certain leaders and theologians on both sides tried to heal the breach and reunite East and West. In 1274, at the second Council of Lyon, agreement was reached between the two churches over several key issues—Orthodox acceptance of papal primacy and the acceptance of the Nicene Creed with the <e>Filioque</e> clause. But the agreements were only a rushed action conditioned by political intrigue. As a result, reunion on these terms was fiercely rejected by the clergy and laity in Constantinople and other Orthodox provinces. A second attempt at reunion came at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="204939" tocid="">Council of Ferrara-Florence</xref> that met in Italy in 1438 and 1439. A formula of union was approved by both delegations, but later it was rejected by rank-and-file Orthodox Christians.

                  The next dramatic church division took place during the Reformation in the West in the 16th century. Like other schisms, this one does not yield to simple analysis or explanation. The Reformation was a mixture of theology, ecclesiology, politics, and nationalism, all of which led to breaks in fellowship and created institutional alienation between Christians throughout Western Christendom. In one sense it was a separation, especially a reaction against the rigid juridical structures of medieval <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="507284" tocid="">Roman Catholicism</xref> and its claim to universal truth and jurisdiction. In another sense, however, the Reformation was an evangelical and ecumenical renewal of the church as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="400846" tocid="">Body of Christ</xref>, an attempt to return to the apostolic and patristic sources in order, according to Calvin, “to recover the face of the ancient Catholic Church.” All the Continental reformers sought to preserve and reclaim the unity of the church.

                <p>
                  Once the separation between the Roman Catholic and new Protestant churches was complete, people on both sides tried to restore unity. Roman Catholics such as Georg Witzel and George Cassander developed proposals for unity, which all parties rejected. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="82788" tocid="">Martin Bucer</xref>, celebrated promoter of church unity among the 16th-century leaders, brought Martin Luther and his colleague <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="373644" tocid="">Philipp Melanchthon</xref> into dialogue with the Swiss reformer <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="658598" tocid="">Huldrych Zwingli</xref> at <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="364040" tocid="">Marburg</xref>, Germany, in 1529.

Another attempt was made in 1559, when Melanchthon and Patriarch Joasaph II of Constantinople corresponded, with the intention of using the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="42785" tocid="">Augsburg Confession</xref> as the basis of dialogue between <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="352073" tocid="">Lutheran</xref> and Orthodox Christians. On the eve of the French wars of religions (1561), Roman Catholics and Protestants conferred without success in the Colloquy of Poissy. It would seem that the ecumenical projects of theologians and princes in 16th-century Europe failed unequivocally, but they kept alive the vision and the hope.

Four different strands—the international Christian movement, cooperation in world mission, Life and Work, and Faith and Order—developed in the early decades and, though distinctive in their emphases, later converged to form one ecumenical movement.</p>
                <p>
                  The modern ecumenical era began with a worldwide movement of Christian students, who formed national movements in Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Scandinavia, and Asia. In 1895 the World Student Christian Federation, the vision of American Methodist John R. Mott, was established “to lead students to accept the Christian faith” and to pioneer in Christian unity. The World Missionary Conference at Edinburgh (1910) inaugurated another aspect of ecumenism by dramatizing the necessity of unity and international cooperation in fulfilling the world mission of the church. In 1921 the International Missionary Council (IMC) emerged, bringing together missionary agencies of the West and of the new Christian councils in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for joint consultation, planning, and theological reflection. The Life and Work movement was pledged to practical Christianity and common action by focusing the Christian conscience on international relations and social, industrial, and economic problems. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="552036" tocid="">Nathan Söderblom</xref>, Lutheran archbishop of Uppsala, inspired world conferences on Life and Work at Stockholm (1925) and Oxford (1937). The Faith and Order movement, which originated in the United States, confronted the doctrinal divisions and sought to overcome them. Charles H. Brent, an Episcopal missionary bishop in the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="456399" tocid="">Philippines</xref>, was chiefly responsible for this movement, although Peter Ainslie, of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="165235" tocid="">Disciples of Christ</xref>, shared the same vision and gave significant leadership. World conferences on Faith and Order at Lausanne (Switzerland; 1925), Edinburgh (1937), Lund (Sweden; 1952), and Montreal (1963) guided the process of theological consensus building among Protestants, Orthodox, and Roman Catholics, which led to approval by the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches of the historic convergence text <e>Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry</e> (1982).

                  The <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648248" tocid="">World Council of Churches</xref> (WCC) is a privileged instrument of the ecumenical movement. Constituted at Amsterdam in 1948, the conciliar body includes more than 300 churches—Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox—which “confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour according to the Scriptures and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” Its general secretaries have been among the architects of modern ecumenism: <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="630773" tocid="">Willem Adolph Visser ’t Hooft</xref> (The Netherlands), <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="68778" tocid="">Eugene Carson Blake</xref> (United States), Philip Potter (Dominica), Emilio Castro (Uruguay), Konrad Raiser (Germany), and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="1012729" tocid="">Samuel Kobia</xref> (Kenya). The witness and programs of the WCC include faith and order, mission and evangelism, refugee and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="497024" tocid="">relief work</xref>, interfaith dialogue, justice and peace, theological education, and solidarity with women and the poor. What distinguishes the WCC constituency is the forceful involvement of Orthodox churches and churches from the developing world. Through their active presence the WCC, and the wider ecumenical movement, has become a genuinely international community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roman Catholic ecumenism received definitions and momentum at the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Second Vatican Council</xref> (Vatican II; 1962–65), under the ministries of Popes John XXIII and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="446981" tocid="">Paul VI</xref>, and through the ecumenical diplomacy of Augustin Cardinal Bea, the first president of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity. The church gave the ecumenical movement new hope and language in the “Decree on Ecumenism” (1964), one of the classic ecumenical teaching documents. Another result of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="624014" tocid="">Vatican II</xref> was the establishment of a wide variety of international theological dialogues, commonly known as bilateral conversations. These included Roman Catholic bilaterals with Lutherans (1965), Orthodox (1967), Anglicans (1967), Methodists (1967), Reformed (1970), and the Disciples of Christ (1977). Topics identified for reconciling discussions include baptism, the Eucharist, episcopacy and papacy, authority in the church, and mixed marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Critical to modern ecumenism is the birth of united churches, which have reconciled formerly divided churches in a given place. In Asia and Africa the first united churches were organized in China (1927), Thailand (1934), Japan (1941), and the Philippines (1944). The most heralded examples of this ecumenism are the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="615491" tocid="">United Church of Canada</xref> (1925), the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="556252" tocid="">Church of South India</xref> (1947), and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="419259" tocid="">Church of North India</xref> (1970). Statistics of other united churches are revealing. Between 1948 and 1965, 23 churches were formed. In the period from 1965 to 1970, unions involving two or more churches occurred in the West Indies (in Jamaica and Grand Cayman), Ecuador, Zambia, Zaire (now the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="132363" tocid="">Democratic Republic of the Congo</xref>), Pakistan, Madagascar, <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="442191" tocid="">Papua New Guinea</xref>, the Solomon Islands, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="59268" tocid="">Belgium</xref>. Strategic union conversations were undertaken in the United States by the nine-church Consultation on Church Union (1960) and by such uniting churches as the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="615499" tocid="">United Church of Christ</xref> (1957), the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (1983), and the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="196846" tocid="">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</xref> (1988).

                <p>Spiritual disciplines play a key role in ecumenism, a movement steeped in prayer for unity. During the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, celebrated every year (January 18–25), Christians from many traditions engage in prayer, Bible study, worship, and fellowship in anticipation of the unity that Christ wills.</p>

            <headtitle>Christianity and world religions</headtitle>
            <p>The global spread of Christianity through the activity of European and American churches in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries brought it into contact with all other existing religions. Meanwhile, since the beginning of the 19th century, the close connection between Christian world missions and political, economic, technical, and cultural expansion was, at the same time, loosened.</p>
            <p>
              After <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="648813" tocid="">World War II</xref> the former mission churches were transformed into independent churches in the newly autonomous Asian and African states. The concern for a responsible cooperation of the members of Christian minority churches and its non-Christian fellow citizens became the more urgent with a renaissance of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="38479" tocid="">Asian</xref> higher religions in numerous Asian states.
            </p>
            <p>
              Missionaries of Asian world religions moved into Europe, the Americas, and Australia. Numerous Vedanta centres were established to introduce Hindu teachings within the framework of the Ramakrishna and Vivekananda missions. In 1965 the <xref refid="1751517" ty="1" topicid="255215" tocid="">Hare Krishna</xref> movement was founded in the United States, attracting followers to its version of <xref refid="2032881" ty="1" topicid="621641" tocid="">Vaishnavism</xref>, one of the main branches of Hinduism. Followers of South Asian <xref refid="2032880" ty="1" topicid="591236" tocid="">Theravada</xref> <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="83184" tocid="">Buddhism</xref> and <xref refid="2032879" ty="1" topicid="358037" tocid="">Mahayana</xref> Buddhism, particularly that of Japan (largely <xref refid="2032874" ty="1" topicid="483872" tocid="">Pure Land</xref>, <xref refid="2032875" ty="1" topicid="414039" tocid="">Nichiren</xref> [especially <xref refid="2032877" ty="1" topicid="552747" tocid="">Soka Gakkai</xref>], and <xref refid="2032878" ty="1" topicid="656421" tocid="">Zen</xref>) and Tibet, founded temples (some of which are called “churches”), meditation centres, community centres, and other spiritual retreats. This influence penetrated Europe and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="418612" tocid="">North America</xref> on several fronts, whether in the form of a spontaneously received flow of religious ideas and methods of <xref refid="2034122" ty="1" topicid="372609" tocid="">meditation</xref> through literature and philosophy, through developments in psychology and psychotherapy, or through institutions within which individuals can develop a personal practice of meditation and participate in the life of the <e>sangha</e> (community). As a result, Christianity in the latter part of the 20th century found itself forced to enter into a factual discussion with non-Christian religions.
            </p>
            <p>
              There has also been a general transformation of religious consciousness in the West since the middle of the 19th century. Until about 1900, knowledge of non-Christian world religions was still the privilege of a few specialists. During the 20th century, however, a wide range of people studied translations of source materials from the non-Christian religions. The dissemination of the religious art of India and East Asia through touring exhibitions and the prominence of the <xref refid="1776566" ty="1" topicid="150076" tocid="">Dalai Lama </xref>as a political and religious figure have created a new attitude toward the other religions in the broad public of Europe and North America. In recognition of this fact, numerous Christian institutions for the study of non-Christian religions were founded: e.g., in Bangalore, India; in Yangon, Myanmar (Rangoon, Burma); in Bangkok, Thailand; in Kyōto, Japan; and in <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="270971" tocid="">Hong Kong</xref>, China.
            </p>
            <p>
              The readiness of encounter or even cooperation of Christianity with non-Christian religions is a phenomenon of modern times. Until the 18th century, Christians showed little inclination to engage in a serious study of other religions. Even though contacts with Islam had existed since its founding, the first translation of the Qurʾān (the Islamic scriptures) was issued only in 1141 in Toledo by <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="453863" tocid="">Peter the Venerable</xref>, abbot of Cluny. Four hundred years later, in 1542/43, Theodor Bibliander, a theologian and successor of the Swiss reformer Zwingli, edited the translation of the Qurʾān by Peter the Venerable. He was subsequently arrested, and he and his publisher could be freed only through the intervention of Luther.
            </p>
            <p>
              Christian exposure to Asian religions also was delayed. Although the name Buddha is mentioned for the first time in Christian literature—and there only once—by Clement of Alexandria about <e ty="s">ad</e> 200, it did not appear again for some 1,300 years. <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="439818" tocid="">Pali</xref>, the language of the Buddhist canon, remained unknown in the West until the early 19th century, when the modern Western study of Buddhism began.
            </p>
            <p>The reasons for such reticence toward contact with foreign religions were twofold: (1) The ancient church was significantly influenced by the Jewish attitude toward contemporary pagan religions. Like Judaism, it viewed the pagan gods as “nothings” next to the true God; they were offsprings of human error that were considered to be identical with the wooden, stone, or bronze images that were made by humans. (2) Besides this, there was the tendency to identify the pagan gods as evil demonic forces engaged in combat with the true God. The conclusion of the history of salvation, according to the Christian understanding, was to be a final struggle between Christ and his church on one side and Antichrist and his minions on the other, culminating with the victory of Christ.</p>

              <p>
                The history of religion, however, continued even after Christ. During the 3rd and 4th centuries a new world religion appeared in the form of <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="362167" tocid="">Manichaeanism</xref>, which asserted itself as a superior form of Christianity with a new universal claim of validity. The Christian church never acknowledged the claims of Manichaeanism but considered the religion a Christian heresy and opposed it as such.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christianity faced greater challenges when it encountered <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="295507" tocid="">Islam</xref> and the religions of East Asia. When Islam was founded in the 7th century, it considered the revelations of the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="396226" tocid="">Prophet Muhammad</xref> to be superior to those of the Old and New Testaments. Christianity also fought Islam as a Christian heresy and saw it as the fulfillment of the eschatological prophecies of the Apocalypse concerning the coming of the “false prophet” (<xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="500324" tocid="">Revelation to John</xref>). The religious and political competition between Christianity and Islam led to the Crusades, which influenced the self-consciousness of Western Christianity in the Middle Ages and later centuries. In China and Japan, however, missionaries saw themselves forced into an argument with indigenous religions that could be carried on only with intellectual weapons. The old Logos theory prevailed in a new form founded on <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="406283" tocid="">natural law</xref>, particularly among the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="302999" tocid="">Jesuit</xref> theologians who worked at the Chinese emperor’s court in Beijing. The Jesuits also sought to adapt indigenous religious traditions to Christian rituals but were forbidden from doing so by the pope during the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="112770" tocid="">Chinese Rites Controversy</xref>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Philosophical and cultural developments during the <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="188441" tocid="">Enlightenment</xref> brought changes in the understanding of Christianity and other world religions. During the Enlightenment the existence of the plurality of world religions was recognized by the educated in Europe, partly—as in the case of the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz—in immediate connection with the theories of natural law of the Jesuit missionaries in China. Only in the philosophy of the Enlightenment was the demand of tolerance, which thus far in Christian Europe had been applied solely to the followers of another Christian denomination, extended to include the followers of different religions.
              </p>
              <p>Some missionaries of the late 18th and19th centuries, however, ignored this knowledge or consciously fought against it. Simple lay Christianity of revivalist congregations demanded that a missionary denounce all pagan “idolatry.” The spiritual and intellectual argument with non-Christian world religions simply did not exist for this simplified theology, and in this view a real encounter of Christianity with world religions did not, on the whole, occur in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

              <headtitle>Contemporary views</headtitle>
              <p>
                The 20th century experienced an explosion of publicly available information concerning the wider religious life of humanity, as a result of which the older Western assumption of the manifest superiority of Christianity ceased to be plausible for many Christians. Early 20th-century thinkers such as <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="434884" tocid="">Rudolf Otto</xref>, who saw religion throughout the world as a response to the Holy, and <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="606217" tocid="">Ernst Troeltsch</xref>, who showed that, socioculturally, Christianity is one of a number of comparable traditions, opened up new ways of regarding the other major religions.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the 20th century most Christians adopted one of three main points of view. According to exclusivism, there is salvation only for Christians. This theology underlay much of the history outlined above, expressed both in the Roman Catholic dogma <e>extra ecclesiam nulla salus</e> (“outside the church no salvation”) and in the assumption of the 18th- and 19th-century Protestant missionary movements. The exclusivist outlook was eroded within advanced Roman Catholic thinking in the decades leading up to the Second Vatican Council and was finally abandoned in the council’s pronouncements. Pope <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="305139" tocid="">John Paul II</xref>’s outreach to the world’s religions may be seen as the practical application of the decisions of Vatican II. Within Protestant Christianity there is no comparable central authority, but most Protestant theologians, except within the extreme fundamentalist constituencies, have also moved away from the exclusivist position.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the mid-20th century many Roman Catholics and Protestants have moved toward inclusivism—the view that, although salvation is by definition Christian, brought about by the atoning work of Christ, it is nevertheless available in principle to all <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="275376" tocid="">human beings</xref>, whether Christian or not. The Roman Catholic theologian <xref refid="1751680" ty="1" topicid="489663" tocid="">Karl Rahner</xref> expressed the inclusivist view by saying that good and devout people of other faiths may, even without knowing it, be regarded as “anonymous Christians.” Others have expressed in different ways the thought that non-Christians also are included within the universal scope of Christ’s salvific work and their religions fulfilled in Christianity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third position, which appealed to a number of individual theologians, was <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="465162" tocid="">pluralism</xref>. According to this view, the great world faiths, including Christianity, are valid spheres of a salvation that takes characteristically different forms within each—though consisting in each case in the transformation of human existence from self-centredness to a new orientation toward the Divine Reality. The other religions are not secondary contexts of Christian redemption but independent paths of salvation. The pluralist position is controversial in Christian theology, because it affects the ways in which the doctrines of the person of Christ, atonement, and the Trinity are formulated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christians engage in dialogue with the other major religions through the World Council of Churches’ organization on Dialogue with People of Living Faiths and Ideologies and through the Vatican’s Secretariat for Non-Christians, as well as through a variety of extra-ecclesiastical associations, such as the World Congress of Faiths. There is a <xref refid="0" ty="1" topicid="404678" tocid="">National Council of Churches</xref> of Christ in the United States, and practically every state has its own similar state-level organization. A multitude of interreligious encounters have taken place throughout the world, many initiated by Christian and others by non-Christian individuals and groups.

At lower levels the larger dales are more richly wooded, and the trees stand out against a background of rugged cliffs of white-gray rocks. On both Pennine flanks, older rocks disappear beneath younger layers, and the uplands merge into flanking coastal lowlands.

Many deep gorges, separated by narrow ridges and sharp peaks, characterize the northern Cumbrian Mountains, which consist of tough slate rock. Greater expanses of level upland, formed from thick beds of lava and the ash thrown out by ancient volcanoes, lie to the south. The volcanic belt is largely an irregular upland traversed by deep, narrow valleys, and it includes England’s highest point, Scafell Pike, with an elevation of 3,210 feet (978 metres), and Helvellyn, at 3,116 feet (950 metres). Nine rivers flowing out in all directions from the centre of this uplifted dome form a classic radial drainage pattern. The valleys, often containing long, narrow lakes, have been widened to a U shape by glacial action, which has also etched corries from the mountainsides and deposited the debris in moraines. Glacial action also created a number of “hanging valleys” by truncating former tributary valleys.

Cycles of erosion have repeatedly worn down the ancient and austere surfaces.

These smooth, rounded, grass-covered moorlands present a remarkably even skyline. Below 700 feet (210 metres) lies a further series of former wave-cut surfaces. Several valleys radiate from the highland core to the coastal regions. In the west these lowlands have provided a haven for traditional Welsh culture, but the deeply penetrating eastern valleys have channeled English culture into the highland.

            </p>
            <p>At the higher altitudes of the highland zone, particularly in Scotland, the weather is characterized by a cold, wet regime of more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) rainfall and less than 47 °F (8 °C) mean temperature annually; these areas have blanket peat and peaty podzol soils, with their organic surface layer resting on a gray, leached base. A regime similarly wet but with a mean annual temperature exceeding 47 °F characterizes most of the remainder of the highland zone, particularly on the lower parts of the Southern Uplands, the Solway Firth–Lake District area, the peripheral plateaus of Wales, and most of southwestern England. These areas are covered by acid brown soils and weakly podzolized associates. On the lower-lying areas within the highland zone, particularly in eastern Scotland and the eastern flanks of the Pennines, a relatively cold, dry regime gives rise to soils intermediate between the richer brown earths and the podzols.</p>
            <p>
              Over the entire lowland zone, which also has a mean annual temperature above 47 °F but less than 40 inches of rainfall, leached brown soils are characteristic. Calcareous, and thus alkaline, parent materials are widespread, particularly in the southeast, so acid soils and podzols are confined to the most quartz-laden parent materials. In Northern Ireland at elevations of about 460 feet (140 metres), brown earths give way to semipodzols, and these grade upslope into more intensively leached podzols, particularly in the Sperrins and the Mournes.

The main types of air masses, according to their source regions, are polar and tropical; by their route of travel, both the polar and tropical may be either maritime or continental. For much of the year, the weather depends on the sequence of disturbances within the midlatitude westerlies that bring in mostly polar maritime and occasionally tropical maritime air. In winter occasional high-pressure areas to the east allow biting polar continental air to sweep over Britain. All of these atmospheric systems tend to fluctuate rapidly in their paths and to vary both in frequency and intensity by season and also from year to year. Variability is characteristic of British weather, and extreme conditions, though rare, can be very important for the life of the country.

              The polar maritime winds that reach the United Kingdom in winter create a temperature distribution that is largely independent of latitude. Thus, the north-to-south run of the 40 °F (4 °C) January isotherm, or line of equal temperature, from the coast in northwestern Scotland south to the Isle of Wight betrays the moderating influence of the winds blowing off the Atlantic Ocean. In summer polar maritime air is less common, and the 9° difference of latitude and the distance from the sea assume more importance, so that temperatures increase from north to south and from the coast inland. Above-average temperatures usually accompany tropical continental air, particularly in anticyclonic, or high-pressure, conditions. On rare occasions these southerly or southeasterly airstreams can bring heat waves to southern England with temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C). The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 °F (8 °C) in the <xref refid="0"

June, on average, is the driest month throughout Britain; May is the next driest in the eastern and central parts of England, but April is drier in parts of the west and north. The wettest months are typically October, December, and August, but in a given year almost any month can prove to be the wettest, and the association of Britain with seemingly perpetual rainfall (a concept popularly held among foreigners) is based on a germ of truth. Some precipitation falls as snow, which increases with altitude and from southwest to northeast. The average number of days with snow falling can vary from as many as 30 in blizzard-prone northeastern Scotland to as few as five in southwestern England. Average daily hours of sunshine vary from less than three in the extreme northeast to about four and one-half along the southeastern coast.

The other nocturnal vegetarian, the brown hare, lives in open lowland country, while the mountain hare is native to Scotland. Amphibians include three species of newt and five species of frogs and toads, while reptiles comprise three species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of lizards. There are no snakes in Northern Ireland.

            <p>Marshland reclamation has displaced waterfowl to various bird sanctuaries. A continuous effort by ornithological organizations has promoted and encouraged research and conservation.

              <p>The diverse forms and patterns of settlement in the United Kingdom reflect not only the physical variety of the landscape but also the successive movements of peoples arriving as settlers, refugees, or conquerors from continental Europe, along with the changing economic contexts in which settlement has occurred. Social and economic advantages led some people to cluster, whereas others had an equally strong desire for separateness. Both tendencies mark settlement forms in Britain from very early times, and regional contrasts in the degree of dispersion and nucleation are frequent.</p>

In Scotland great changes accompanied the late 18th-century Highland clearances, in which landlords forcibly evicted tenants and converted their holdings to sheep pastures. As late as the 1880s many clachans disappeared in Northern Ireland as part of a deliberate policy of reallocating land to new dispersed farmsteads. Great changes have also occurred in the lowland zone, where the swing to individual ownership or tenancy from the medieval custom of landholding in common brought about not only dispersion and deserted villages but the enclosure of fields by hedges and walls. Villages remain remarkably stable features of the rural landscape of Britain, however, and linear, round, oval, and ring-shaped villages survive, many with their ancient greens still held in common by the community.

                Since the 1930s the population has experienced a complete cycle in its pattern of growth. A low rate of increase during the 1930s was followed by a post-World War II marriage boom that accelerated the rate of growth, culminating in a peak during the mid-1960s. After 1964 a considerable fall in the birth rate brought about a dramatic decline in growth, with a small absolute decline in population between 1974 and 1978. However, modest population growth resumed during the 1980s, and the population of the United Kingdom rose from 56 million in 1980 to about 60 million by the end of the 20th century. The main cause of these abrupt shifts was the erratic nature of the birth rate, with the interaction of two opposing trends: on one hand, a long-term general decline in fertility and, on the other, a rising longevity and a decline in death rates. Such processes also have affected the <xref refid="0"

Until 1700 the relatively small population was sparsely distributed and largely rural and agricultural, much as it had been in medieval times.

At the same time, agriculture underwent technical and tenurial changes that allowed increased production with a smaller workforce, and revolutionary improvements in transport facilitated the movement of materials and people. As a result, by the late 19th century a theretofore mainly rural population had largely become a nation of industrial workers and town dwellers.

Many of the displaced landless agricultural labourers were attracted to the better employment opportunities and the higher wage levels of the growing industries. Meanwhile, a rapid rise in the birth rate had produced a growing population of young people in the countryside who faced little prospect of agricultural employment. These groups contributed to a high volume of internal migration toward the towns.

                Industry, as well as the urban centres that inevitably grew up around it, concentrated near the coalfields, while the railway network, which grew rapidly after 1830, enhanced the commercial importance of many towns.

As the economy stabilized during the 1990s, migration from Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern England subsided. While the South East (including Greater London) was the chief destination of external immigrants into Britain, this region, along with the West Midlands, produced a growing internal migration to surrounding regions of England during the 1990s. This pattern reflected a larger trend of migration out of older urban centres throughout Britain to surrounding rural areas and small towns at the end of the 20th century.

              <p>The United Kingdom is unusual, even among western European countries, in the small proportion of its employed population (about 2 percent) engaged in agriculture. With commercial intensification of yields and a high level of mechanization, supported initially by national policy and subsequently by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, the output of some agricultural products has exceeded demand. Employment in agriculture has declined gradually, and, with the introduction of policies to achieve reduction of surpluses, the trend is likely to continue. Efforts have been made to create alternative employment opportunities in rural areas, some of which are remote from towns. The land area used for agriculture (about three-quarters of the total) has also declined, and the arable share has fallen in favour of pasture.</p>
              <p>

                      tocid="">food</xref> supplies at reasonable prices. To achieve these aims, the CAP provides a system of minimum prices for domestic goods and levies on imports to support domestic prices. Exports are encouraged by subsidies that make up the difference between the world market price and the EU price. For a few products, particularly beef and sheep, there are additional payments made directly to producers. More recent policies have included milk quotas, land set-asides (to compensate farmers for taking land out of agricultural use), and reliance on the price mechanism as a regulator.

            <p>Construction in Britain stagnated during the 1990s because of a decline in prices and in demand for new housing and because of decreased government investment in infrastructure during the first half of the decade. About half the labour force in construction is self-employed. More than half of all construction work is on new projects, the remainder on repair and maintenance. There has been a marked switch from housing funded and owned by public authorities toward private development. Considerable efforts have also been made to encourage tenants of publicly owned rented houses to become owner-occupiers, with the result that the proportion of owner-occupied homes has grown considerably since the early 1970s. The supply of privately rented accommodations became scarcer because of statutory rent controls that discouraged new construction, but changes during the 1980s both in the economic climate and in official policy began to stimulate the supply. The average price of a new house, particularly in London and the South East, has generally continued to increase more rapidly than the prevailing rate of inflation, although prices have fluctuated considerably. In turn, the rising price of new homes has created considerable pressure on the land available for housing, which has been relatively tightly controlled. Here, too, public policy has been changing in favour of greater permissiveness.</p>

For example, housing loans used to be primarily the responsibility of building societies, but increasingly banks and insurance companies have entered this area of lending. Two related developments have occurred: the transformation of building-society branch offices into virtual banks with personal cashing facilities and the diversification of all three of these types of institutions into real estate services. Building societies also participate to a limited extent in investment services, insurance, trusteeship, executorship, and land services.

Capital flows have increased, as have foreign exchange and securities trading. Consequently, London has more foreign banks than any other city in the world. Increased competition and technological developments have accelerated change. The International Stock Exchange was reorganized, and the historical two-tier structure of brokers, who executed investors’ instructions to buy and sell stocks and shares, and jobbers, who “made” markets in these securities, was abolished. As a result, new companies link British and foreign banks with former brokers and jobbers. The Financial Services Act of 1986, the Building Societies Act of 1987, and the Banking Act of 1987 regulate these new financial organizations. In 1997 the government established a Financial Services Authority (FSA) to regulate the financial services industry; it replaced a series of separate supervisory organizations, some of them based on self-regulation.

Since 1999 Wales has also had its own assembly, but because it has neither legislative nor tax-gathering powers, the Welsh assembly is significantly less powerful than the Scottish Parliament.

Like Scottish legislators, members of the Welsh assembly are elected by proportional representation. The Northern Ireland Assembly gained limited legislative and executive power at the end of 1999. Its members, like those of the other regional assemblies, are elected by proportional representation. It has power over matters concerning agriculture, economic development, education, the environment, health, and social services, but the Westminster government retains control over foreign affairs, defense, general economic policy, taxation, policing, and <xref refid="0"

They are funded by the rates that they levy, by fees for services, and by grants from the central government.

In Scotland and Wales regional governments handle some of these functions, and local governments handle the remainder. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Assembly is responsible for many of these functions. The responsibilities of local governments in Northern Ireland are limited to environmental matters, sanitation, and recreation.
            </p>
            <p>Parts of the United Kingdom have as many as three levels, or tiers, of local government, each with its own responsibilities, whereas other areas have only a single tier or two tiers. Throughout England, parish and town councils form the lowest tier of local government. (Parishes are civil subdivisions, usually centred on a village or small town, that are distinct from church bodies.) They have the power to assess “precepts” (surcharges) on the local rates and a range of rights and duties, including maintenance of commons, recreational facilities, and environmental quality and participation in the planning process. Community councils perform a similar role in Wales, whereas community councils in Scotland are voluntary and consultative bodies with few statutory powers. This lowest level of local government has no counterpart in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p>The next tier of local government is usually known in England and Northern Ireland as a district, borough, or city. In Northern Ireland this is the only level of local government. In Scotland and Wales this second tier is the only one with broad powers over major local government functions. In Wales these local government areas are known as either counties or county boroughs, while in Scotland they are variously known as council areas or local government authorities or, in some cases, cities. In some areas of England this second tier of local government is the only one with broad statutory and administrative powers. These areas are known in England as unitary authorities (since they form a single tier of local government above the parishes and towns) or metropolitan boroughs (which are functionally equivalent to unitary authorities but form part of a larger metropolitan county). In other areas of England, districts, boroughs, and cities form an intermediate tier of local government between the towns and parishes on the one hand and administrative counties on the other. Administrative counties, which cover much of England, are the highest tier of local government where they exist.</p>

However, in 2000 a new Greater London Authority (GLA) was established with very limited revenue-gathering powers but with responsibility for public transport, policing, emergency services, the environment, and planning in Greater London as a whole. The GLA consists of a directly elected mayor (a constitutional innovation for the United Kingdom, which had never previously filled any executive post by direct election) and a 25-member assembly elected by proportional representation.

              Whereas the administrative counties of England and the counties and county boroughs of Wales have statutory and administrative powers, there are other areas throughout the United Kingdom that are called counties but lack administrative power. In England, metropolitan counties cover metropolitan areas; they serve as geographic and statistical units, but since 1986 their administrative powers have belonged to their constituent metropolitan boroughs. Moreover, in England there is a unit known variously as a ceremonial county or a geographic county. These counties also form geographic and statistical units. In most cases they comprise an administrative county and one or more unitary authorities. In other cases they comprise one or more unitary authorities without an administrative county. Greater London and each of the metropolitan counties also constitute ceremonial and geographic counties.

            <p>Finally, every part of the United Kingdom lies within what is known as a historic county. The historic counties have formed geographic and cultural units since the Middle Ages, and they historically had a variety of administrative powers. The Local Government Act of 1888 regularized the administrative powers of counties and reassigned them to new administrative counties with the same names as the historic counties but with different boundaries in some cases. Successive local government reorganizations in the 1970s and ’90s redrew the boundaries of administrative units in the United Kingdom so that no remaining administrative unit corresponds directly to a historic county, although many administrative and geographic counties and other local government units carry the names of historic counties. Still, even though they lack administrative power, historic counties remain important cultural units. They serve as a focus for local identity, and cultural institutions such as sporting associations are often organized by historic county.</p>

More serious crimes also come initially before a magistrate’s court. The system is similar in Northern Ireland, but in Scotland district and sheriff courts try most criminal cases. The police must bring an arrested person before a magistrate within 36 hours, but the magistrate can authorize further detention without charge for up to 96 hours. Only 1 percent of suspects are held without charge for more than 24 hours, however. The magistrate decides whether the accused should be held on bail or in custody.</p>

            <p>The House of Commons is elected for a maximum term of five years. At any time during those five years, the prime minister has the right to ask the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. A government with a working majority is expected to govern for the greater part of its term, though it rarely runs to the end. An early election may take place if there is no working majority, and the prime minister need give only 17 working days’ notice of a general election. Parliamentary candidates’ campaign spending is strictly limited. Since 2000, national party expenditure, which was previously unrestricted, has been limited to a maximum of £20 million per party. In addition, each party is allocated free election broadcasts on the main television channels. Televised debates between the leaders of the principal parties (de facto candidates for prime minister) were a part of the campaign process for the first time in the 2010 general election. No paid political advertising is permitted on television or radio. These provisions and the uncertainty about the timing of an election produce campaigns that are, by international standards, unusually brief and relatively inexpensive.</p>

            <p>The two-party system, together with uncertainty about the timing of a general election, has produced the British phenomenon of the official opposition.

                      tocid="">National Health Service</xref> (NHS) provides comprehensive health care throughout the United Kingdom. The NHS provides medical care through a tripartite structure of primary care, hospitals, and community health care. The main element in primary care is the system of general practitioners (family doctors), who provide preventive and curative care and who refer patients to hospital and specialist services. All consultations with a general practitioner under the NHS are free.
              </p>
              <p>The other major types of primary medical care are dentistry and pharmaceutical and opthalmic services. These are the only services of the NHS for which charges are levied, though persons under age 16, past retirement, or with low incomes are usually exempt. Everyone else must pay charges that are below the full cost of the services involved.</p>
              <p>
                Under the Department of Health in England are four regional health directors who oversee area health authorities, whose major responsibility is to run the hospital service. (Overseeing the health authorities in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of their respective parliament or assembly.) Hospitals absorb more than two-thirds of the NHS budget. All hospital treatment under the NHS is free, including consultations with doctors, <xref refid="0"

              </p>
              <p>The Community Health Service has three functions: to provide preventive health services; to act as a liaison with local government, especially over matters of public health; and to cooperate with local government personal social service departments to enable health and personal care to be handled together whenever possible.</p>
              <p>Individuals can register with any NHS general practitioner in their area who is prepared to add them to his or her list of patients. Anyone who wishes to change to another doctor may do so. Except in emergencies, patients are referred to a hospital by their general practitioner, allowing patients an element of choice.</p>
              <p>
                Apart from the charges mentioned above, treatment under the NHS is free to the patient. The service is almost entirely funded by government revenues, with less than 5 percent of NHS revenue coming from charges. This arrangement is unique among industrialized countries. There is no substantial reliance on private medical insurance (as, for example, in the <xref refid="0"

              </p>
              <p>The NHS budget, like that for any other government service, is determined by negotiations between the Treasury and the spending departments, as modified by subsequent discussion in the cabinet. The resulting figure is a budget for the NHS as a whole. The division of money throughout the United Kingdom is partly constrained by a formula designed to improve the geographic distribution of medical resources. Each regional authority divides its total funds among the area health authorities.</p>
              <p>Alongside the NHS is a system of private medical care both for primary care and for hospital treatment. Although it grew somewhat in the 1980s and ’90s, the sector absorbs only about one-tenth of the total expenditure on doctors and hospital inpatient care. Most private care is financed by voluntary private medical insurance.</p>
              <p>

The NHS is very inexpensive by international standards; in the late 1990s, for example, the United Kingdom spent about half the percentage of GDP on health care as the United States. Despite such low spending, health in the United Kingdom, measured in terms of infant mortality and life expectancy, matches that in comparable countries. The variation in the quality and quantity of treatment by income level is smaller than in most other countries. The system is able to direct resources toward specific regions and specific types of care. Treatment is free, whatever the extent and duration of illness, no one is denied care because of low income, and no one fears financial ruin as a result of treatment.

Other means-tested benefits assist low-paid working families with children and help people on low incomes with their housing costs. An important class of noncontributory benefits is not means-tested, the major example being the child benefit, a weekly tax-free payment for each child, usually payable to the mother.</p>

                The 1946 system has changed substantially over the years, with a burst of reform in the mid-1970s, including an increase in earnings-related pensions, and another in the late 1990s.

                Overall responsibility for education in England rests with the secretary of state for children, schools, and families, who is accountable to Parliament and responsible for the health, education, and welfare of young people. In Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, separate departments of education are headed by ministers who answer to the country’s parliament or assembly. Primary and <xref refid="0"

              </p>
              <p>Primary education is free and compulsory from age 5 to 11. LEAs provide secondary education, which is organized in a variety of ways, for children aged 11 to 19; it is free and compulsory to age 16. Teachers employed by the LEAs are paid on an agreed national scale. The state finances primary and secondary education out of central and local tax revenues. Most expenditures take place at the local level, though about half of local revenues derive from the central government.</p>
              <p>
                In most parts of the United Kingdom, secondary schools are comprehensive—that is, they are open to pupils of all abilities. Pupils may stay on past the minimum leaving age of 16 to earn a certificate or take public examinations that qualify them for <xref refid="0"

                      tocid="">higher education</xref>. In much of Northern Ireland and in some scattered LEAs in Great Britain (particularly in Kent), pupils take an intelligence examination at age 11, on the basis of which they are assigned to one of two kinds of secondary schools: grammar schools, which prepare them for higher education; or secondary modern schools, which prepare them for jobs that do not require higher education.
              </p>
              <p>The secretary of state has the duty to establish a national curriculum applicable to all state schools. Individual schools control their own management and finance and may apply to opt out of control by local authorities. Schools are required to maintain open enrollment.</p>

              <headtitle>Private schools</headtitle>
              <p>Alongside the state sector, a small number of private schools (often called “public schools”) provide education for about one-twentieth of children. Their existence is controversial. It is argued that private schools divert gifted children and teachers and scarce financial resources from state schools and that they perpetuate economic and social divisions. The counterarguments focus on their high quality, the beneficial effects of competition, and parents’ freedom of choice.</p>

              <headtitle>Higher education</headtitle>
              <p>Universities historically have been independent and self-governing; however, they have close links with the central government because a large proportion of their income derives from public funds. Higher education also takes place in other colleges.</p>
              <p>Students do not have a right to a place at a university; they are carefully selected by examination performance, and the dropout rate is low by international standards. Most students receive state-funded grants inversely related to their parents’ income to cover the tuition fees. In addition, most students receive state-funded loans to cover living expenses. Foreign students and British students taking a degree at an overseas university are not generally eligible for public funding.</p>
              <p>Public funds flow to universities through recurrent grants and in the form of tuition fees; universities also derive income from foreign students and from various private-sector sources. After a major expansion in the 1960s, the system came under pressure in the 1980s. Public funding became more restricted, and the grant system no longer supported students adequately. The government introduced the present system of student loans to replace dwindling grants for living expenses and established higher-education funding councils in each part of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) to coordinate state support of higher education.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom’s cultural traditions are reflective of the country’s heterogeneity and its central importance in world affairs over the past several centuries. Each constituent part of the United Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland—maintains its own unique customs, traditions, cuisine, and festivals. Moreover, as Britain’s empire spanned the globe, it became a focal point of immigration, especially after the independence of its colonies, from its colonial possessions. As a result, immigrants from all corners of the world have entered the United Kingdom and settled throughout the country, leaving indelible imprints on British culture. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, age-old English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh customs stood alongside the rich traditions of Afro-Caribbean, Asian, and Muslim immigrants, placing the United Kingdom among the world’s most cosmopolitan and diverse countries.</p>

From medieval time to the present, this extraordinary flowering of the arts has been encouraged at every level of society. Early royal patronage played an important role in the development of the arts in Britain, and since the mid 20th century the British government has done much to foster their growth.

              Archaeologists working in Norfolk in the early 21st century discovered stone tools that suggest the presence of humans in Britain from about 800,000 to 1 million years ago. These startling discoveries underlined the extent to which archaeological research is responsible for any knowledge of Britain before the Roman conquest (begun <e ty="s">ad</e> 43). Britain’s ancient history is thus lacking in detail, for archaeology can rarely identify personalities, motives, or exact dates or present more than a general overview. All that is available is a picture of successive cultures and some knowledge of economic development. But even in Roman times <xref refid="0"

Thus Britain developed insular characteristics, absorbing and adapting rather than fully participating in successive continental cultures. And within the island geography worked to a similar end; the fertile southeast was more receptive of influence from the adjacent continent than were the less-accessible hill areas of the west and north. Yet in certain periods the use of sea routes brought these too within the ambit of the continent.

                <p>Little is known in detail of the early and middle Bronze Age.

                  From about 1200 <e ty="s">bc</e> there is clearer evidence for agriculture in the south; the farms consisted of circular huts in groups with small oblong fields and stock enclosures. This type of farm became standard in Britain down to and into the Roman period. From the 8th century onward, British communities developed close contacts with their continental European neighbours. Some of the earliest hill forts in Britain were constructed in this period (e.g., Beacon Hill, near Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire; or Finavon, Angus); though formally belonging to the late Bronze Age, they usher in the succeeding period.

                    Britain was an imperial province. The governor represented the emperor, exercising supreme military as well as civil jurisdiction. As commander of three legions he was a senior general of consular rank. From the late 1st century he was assisted on the legal side by a <e>legatus juridicus</e>. The finances were in the hands of the provincial procurator, an independent official of equestrian status whose staff supervised imperial domains and the revenues of mines in addition to normal taxation. In the early 3rd century Britain was divided into two provinces in order to reduce the power of its governor to rebel, as Albinus had done in 196: Britannia Superior had its capital at London and a consular governor in control of two legions and a few auxiliaries; Britannia Inferior, with its capital at York, was under a praetorian governor with one legion but many more auxiliaries.

In military districts control was in the hands of fort prefects responsible to legionary commanders; but by the late 1st century local self-government, as already stated, was granted to <e>civitates peregrinae</e>, whose number tended to increase with time. These also had republican constitutions, being controlled by elected councils and annual magistrates and having responsibility for raising taxes and administering local justice. In the 1st century there were also client kingdoms whose rulers were allied to Rome; Cogidubnus, Verica’s successor, who had his capital at Chichester, is the best known. But Rome regarded these as temporary expedients, and none outlasted the Flavian Period (69–96).

Soldiers and traders from other parts of the empire significantly enhanced the cosmopolitan character of the population, as did the large number of legionaries, who were already citizens and many of whom must have settled locally. The population of Roman Britain at its peak amounted perhaps to about two million.

A Roman gold mine is known in Wales, but its yield was not outstanding. Iron was worked in many places but only for local needs; silver, obtained from lead, was of more significance. But the basis of the economy was agriculture, and the conquest greatly stimulated production because of the requirements of the army. According to Tacitus, grain to feed the troops was levied as a tax; correspondingly more had to be grown before a profit could be made. The pastoralists in Wales and the north probably had to supply leather, which the Roman army needed in quantity for tents, boots, uniforms, and shields. A military tannery is known at Catterick. A profit could, nonetheless, be won from the land because of the increasing demand from the towns. At the same time the development of a system of large estates (villas) relieved the ancient Celtic farming system of the necessity of shouldering the whole burden. Small peasant farmers tended to till the lighter, less-productive, more easily worked soils. Villa estates were established on heavier, richer soils, sometimes on land recently won by forest clearance, itself a result of the enormous new demand for building timber from the army and the <xref refid="0"

In Britain these had therefore to be provided if Roman civilization and normal methods of provincial administration were to be introduced. Thus a policy of <xref refid="0"

The earlier towns consisted of half-timbered buildings; before <e ty="s">ad</e> 100 only public buildings seem to have been of stone. The administrative capitals had regular street grids, a forum with basilica (public hall), public baths, and temples; a few had theatres and amphitheatres, too. With few exceptions they were undefended. In the 3rd century, town walls were provided, not so much as a precaution in unsettled times but as a means of keeping operational the earthwork defenses already provided during a crisis at the end of the 2nd century. These towns grew in size to about 100–130 acres with populations of about 5,000; a few were twice this size. The majority of towns in Roman Britain seem to have developed out of traders’ settlements in the vicinity of early garrison-forts: those that were not selected as administrative centres remained dependent for their existence on economic factors, serving either as centres of trade or manufacture or else as markets for the agricultural peasantry. They varied considerably in size. In the north, where garrisons were permanently established, quite large trading settlements grew up in their vicinity, and at least some of these would rank as towns.

A few owners were prosperous enough in the 2nd century to afford mosaics; but the great period of villa prosperity lay in the 4th century, when many villas grew to impressive size. Their importance was economic and has already been described. Much remains to be learned from full excavation of their subsidiary work buildings. Larger questions of tenure and organization are probably insoluble in the absence of documentary evidence, for it is dangerous to draw analogies from classical sources since conditions in Celtic Britain were very different from those of the Mediterranean world.

                    A great variety of religious cults were to be found. In addition to numerous Celtic deities of local or wider significance, the gods of the classical pantheon were introduced and were often identified with their Celtic counterparts. In official circles the worship of the state gods of Rome and of the imperial cult was duly observed. In addition merchants and soldiers introduced oriental cults, among them <xref refid="0"

The latter, however, made little headway until the late 4th century, though the frescoes at Lullingstone in Kent and the mosaics at Hinton St. Mary in Dorset attest its presence among villa owners. Although classical temples are sometimes found in towns, the normal temple was of the Romano-Celtic type consisting of a small square shrine and surrounding portico; temples of this type are found in town and country alike.

Britain had escaped the barbarian invasions of the 3rd century and may have seemed a safe refuge for wealthy continentals. Its weakness lay in the fact that its defense was ultimately controlled by distant rather than local rulers.

                  Planned settlement of this sort is the best explanation for the earliest Saxon settlements found around the mouths of the east-coast estuaries and also in the central southeast region around Oxford. For a time the system worked successfully, but, when in 442 these Saxon foederati (allies) rebelled and called in others of their race to help them, it was found that they had been given a stranglehold on Britain. A long period of warfare and chaos was inaugurated, which was economically disastrous. It was probably this period that saw the disintegration of the majority of the villa estates; with the breakdown of markets and the escape of slaves, villas ceased to be viable and must have gradually fallen into ruin, though the land itself did not cease to be cultivated. A few villas met a violent end. The towns, under the protection of their strong defenses, at first provided refuge at any rate for the rich who could leave their lands; but by degrees decay set in as trade declined and finally even the supply of food was threatened. About 446 the British made a vain appeal for help to the Roman general <xref refid="0"

                The fate of the native British population is difficult to determine. The case against its large-scale survival rests largely on linguistic evidence, such as the scarcity of Romano-British words continuing into English and the use of English even by Northumbrian peasants. The case against wholesale extermination also rests on linguistic evidence, such as place-names and personal names, as well as on evidence provided by urban and rural archaeology. Certainly few Britons in England were above servile condition. By the end of the 7th century people regarded themselves as belonging to “the nation of the English,” though divided into several kingdoms.

As kingdoms grew larger, for example, an official called an ealderman was needed to administer part of the area, and later a sheriff was needed to look after the royal rights in each shire. The acceptance of Christianity made it necessary to fit the clergy into the scale of compensations and assign a value to their oaths and to fix penalties for offenses such as sacrilege, heathen practices, and breaches of the <xref refid="0"

                  The Anglo-Saxons left England a land of villages, but the continuity of village development is uncertain. In the 7th–8th centuries, in what is called the “Middle Saxon shuffle,” many early villages were abandoned, and others, from which later medieval villages descended, were founded. The oldest villages are not, as previously thought, those with names ending in <e>-ingas</e> but rather those ending in <e>-ham</e> and <e>-ingham</e>. English trading towns, whose names often end in <e>-wich</e>, from the Latin <e>vicus</e> (“village”), developed in the Middle Saxon period, and other urban settlements grew out of and date from the Alfredian and later defenses against Viking attack.

                  Learning was not confined to Northumbria; one Latin work was produced in East Anglia, and recent attribution of manuscripts to Lichfield suggests that Mercian scholarship has been underestimated. Offa himself took an interest in education, and men from all areas corresponded with the missionaries. The Mercian schools that supplied Alfred with scholars in the 9th century may go back to this period. Vernacular poetry was composed, perhaps including <e>Beowulf</e> and the poems of Cynewulf.

In that same year the East Angles threw off the Mercian yoke, killing Beornwulf. In 829 Egbert became ruler of Mercia and all regions south of the Humber, which caused the chronicler to add his name to Bede’s list of kings who held the imperium, calling him bretwalda. The Northumbrians accepted Egbert without fighting. Yet he held this proud position only one year; then Wiglaf recovered the Mercian throne and ruled without subjection to Egbert.

                  Small scattered Viking raids began in the last years of the 8th century; in the 9th century large-scale plundering incursions were made in Britain and in the Frankish empire as well.

Destructive raids are recorded for Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent, and Wessex.

                  A large Danish army came to East Anglia in the autumn of 865, apparently intent on conquest. By 871, when it first attacked Wessex, it had already captured York, been bought off by Mercia, and had taken possession of East Anglia. Many battles were fought in Wessex, including one that led to a Danish defeat at Ashdown in 871. <xref refid="0"

Meanwhile the Danes drove out Burgred of Mercia, putting a puppet king in his place, and one of their divisions made a permanent settlement in Northumbria.

                <p>
                  Alfred was able to force the Danes to leave Wessex in 877, and they settled northeastern Mercia; but a Viking attack in the winter of 878 came near to conquering Wessex. That it did not succeed is to be attributed to Alfred’s tenacity. He retired to the Somerset marshes, and in the spring he secretly assembled an army that routed the Danes at Edington. Their king, <xref refid="0"

                <p>The importance of Alfred’s victory cannot be exaggerated. It prevented the Danes from becoming masters of the whole of England. Wessex was never again in danger of falling under Danish control, and in the next century the Danish areas were reconquered from Wessex. Alfred’s capture of London in 886 and the resultant acceptance of him by all the English outside the Danish areas was a preliminary to this reconquest. That Wessex stood when the other kingdoms had fallen must be put down to Alfred’s courage and wisdom, to his defensive measures in reorganizing his army, to his building fortresses and ships, and to his diplomacy, which made the Welsh kings his allies. Renewed attacks by Viking hosts in 892–896, supported by the Danes resident in England, caused widespread damage but had no lasting success.</p>

                <p>Good internal government contributed to Alfred’s successful resistance to the Danes. He reorganized his finances and the services due from thegns, issued an important code of laws, and scrutinized carefully the exercise of justice. Alfred saw the Viking invasions as a punishment from God, especially because of a neglect of learning, without which men could not know and follow the will of God. He deplored the decay of Latin and enjoined its study by those destined for the church, but he also wished all young freemen of adequate means to learn to read English, and he aimed at supplying men with “the books most necessary for all men to know,” in their own language.</p>
                <p>

                  By becoming rulers of all England, the West Saxon kings had to administer regions with variant customs, governed under West Saxon, Mercian, or Danish law. In some parts of the area of Danish occupation, especially in northern England and the district of the Five Boroughs, the evidence of place-names, personal names, and dialect seems to indicate dense Danish settlement, but this has been seriously questioned; many “Danish” features are also found in Anglo-Saxon areas, and Danish names do not always prove Danish institutions. Moreover, the older Anglo-Saxon regions, such as Mercia, which often cut across both Danish and English areas, were politically more significant. Money, however, was calculated in marks and ores instead of shillings in Danish areas, and arable land was divided into plowlands and oxgangs instead of hides and virgates in the northern and northeastern parts of the Danelaw. Most important was the presence in some areas of a number of small landholders with a much greater degree of independence than their counterparts elsewhere; many <xref refid="0"

                  To those who judged the church solely by the state of its monasteries, the first half of the 10th century seemed a period of inertia. In fact, the great tasks of converting the heathen settlers, restoring ecclesiastical organization in Danish areas, and repairing the damages of the invasions elsewhere must have absorbed much energy. Even so, learning and book production were not at so low an ebb as monastic reformers claimed. Moreover, new monasteries were founded and benefactions were made to older ones, even though, by post-revival standards, none of these monasteries was enforcing a strict monastic rule and several benefactions were held by secular priests. Alfred had failed to arouse much enthusiasm for monasticism. The movement for reform began in England about 940 and soon came under the influence of reforms in Fleury and Lorraine.

                  Ethelred succeeded as a child in 978, after the murder of his stepbrother Edward. He took the throne in an atmosphere of insecurity and distrust, which partly accounts for the incompetence and treachery rife in his reign. Viking raids began in 980 and steadily increased in intensity. They were led by formidable leaders: from 991 to 994 by Olaf Tryggvason, later king of <xref refid="0"

In 1013 the English, worn out by continuous warfare and heavy tributes to buy off the invaders, accepted Sweyn as king. Ethelred, his wife Emma, and his younger sons sought asylum with Richard, duke of Normandy, brother of Emma.

                <p>Canute rewarded some of his followers with English lands and ruthlessly got rid of some prominent Englishmen, among them Edmund’s brother Edwy. (Edmund’s infant sons, however, were carried away to safety in Hungary.) Yet Canute’s rule was not tyrannical, and his reign was remembered as a time of good order. The Danish element in his entourage diminished; and the Englishmen Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and Godwine, Earl of Wessex, became the most powerful magnates. Canute married Ethelred’s widow, Emma, thus removing the danger of Norman support for her sons by Ethelred. Canute fought a successful campaign in Scotland in 1031, and Englishmen were drawn into his wars in Scandinavia, which made him lord of Norway. But at home there was peace. Probably under the influence of Archbishop Wulfstan he became a stout supporter of the church, which in his reign had the vitality to engage in missionary work in Scandinavia. Religious as well as political motives may have caused his pilgrimage to Rome in 1027 to attend the coronation of the emperor Conrad; from the pope, the emperor, and the princes whom he met he obtained concessions for English pilgrims and traders going to Rome. Canute’s laws, drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan, are mainly based on those of earlier kings, especially Edgar.</p>

                  Already in 1018 the English and Danes had come to an agreement “according to Edgar’s law.” No important changes were made in the machinery of government except that small earldoms were combined to make great earldoms, a change that placed much power in the hands of their holders. No attempt was made to restore the English line when Canute died in 1035; he was followed by his sons Harold and <xref refid="0"

Some unpopular Normans were driven out, including Archbishop Robert, whose archbishopric was given to Stigand; this act supplied one excuse for the papal support of William’s cause.

In about 1064 Harold of Wessex, when visiting Normandy, swore to support William’s claim. Only Norman versions of the incident survive and the true circumstances cannot be ascertained, but William used Harold’s broken oath to help secure papal support later. In 1065 Harold acquiesced in the appointment of Morcar, brother of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, to replace Tostig when the Northumbrians revolted against him, and thus Harold turned his brother into an enemy. King Edward, when dying, named Harold to succeed him, and, after overcoming Northumbrian reluctance with the help of Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester, Harold was universally accepted.

                  Harold might have proved an effective ruler, but the forces against him were too strong. The papacy, without hearing the defense in favour of Harold’s succession, gave its blessing to an invasion of a people who had always been distinguished for their loyalty to Rome, and this papal support helped William to collect his army widely. The threat from Harold III Hardraade, who was joined by Tostig, prevented Harold from concentrating his forces in the south and took him north at a critical moment. He fought at <xref refid="0"

Although the Anglo-Saxon fighting force was perhaps the best in Europe and the defeat at Hastings due largely to a series of historical accidents, it is not difficult to understand the English chronicler’s view that God was angry with the English people.

On balance, the debate has favoured dramatic change while also granting that in some respects the Normans learned much from the English past. Yet William replaced his initial policy of trying to govern through Englishmen with an increasingly thoroughgoing Normanization.

                  The Conquest resulted in the subordination of England to a Norman aristocracy. William probably distributed estates to his followers on a piecemeal basis as lands came into his hands. He granted lands directly to fewer than 180 men, making them his tenants in chief. Their estates were often well distributed, consisting of manors scattered through a number of shires. In vulnerable regions, however, compact blocks of land were formed, clustered around castles. The tenants in chief owed homage and fealty to the king and held their land in return for military service. They were under obligation to supply a certain number of knights for the royal feudal host—a number that was not necessarily related to the quantity or quality of land held. Early in the reign many tenants in chief provided <xref refid="0"

They could not, however, use their knights for private warfare, which, in contrast to Normandy, was forbidden in England. In addition to drawing on the forces provided by feudal means, William made extensive use of mercenary troops to secure the military strength he needed. <xref refid="0"

Initially under William there also was little change in personnel.

                  The Conqueror greatly strengthened the administration of justice in his new land.

William introduced one measure to protect his followers: he made the local community of the hundred responsible for the murder of any Norman.

If the country had been conquered again by the Danes, as seemed possible, it might have remained in a backwater of European development. In the event, England was linked, economically and culturally, to France and continental Europe. The aristocracy spoke French, while Latin was the language of the church and the administration.

A compromise was finally arranged in 1107, when it was agreed that the king would surrender investiture with the symbols of spiritual office in return for an agreement that he should supervise the election of the archbishop and take homage for the temporalities before investiture with the spiritual symbols took place.

When Stephen was exchanged for Robert of Gloucester, who was captured at Winchester, Matilda’s fortunes waned. The Angevin cause, however, prospered in Normandy. Although Matilda’s son, Henry, mounted an unsuccessful invasion from Normandy in 1147, in 1153 he carried out a vigorous and effective campaign. Stephen, saddened by the death of his elder son Eustace, agreed to a compromise peace. He was to remain king, but he recognized Henry as his heir.

                  There has been much debate as to why men fought in the civil war. It was much more than a simple succession dispute and can be seen as a natural reaction both to the strong, centralized government of Henry I and to the weak rule of Stephen. The aim of many magnates was to recover lands and offices to which they considered they had hereditary rights: much land had changed hands under Henry I.

Essex wanted to recover the lands and positions his grandfather had held. Most men, however, probably did not want to demolish royal government but rather wished to control and profit from it. The institutions of government did not disappear altogether. The period of the “anarchy” strengthened feudal principles of succession to land, but such offices as those of sheriff and castellan did not become hereditary.

This measure, which could be seen as a revival of the principles of the Anglo-Saxon fyrd, was intended to provide for a local militia, which could be used against invasion, rebellion, or for peacekeeping.

The most controversial issue proved to be that of jurisdiction over “criminous clerks” (clerics who had committed crimes); the king demanded that such men should, after trial in church courts, be sent for punishment in royal courts.
                </p>
                <p>Becket initially accepted the Constitutions but would not set his seal to them. Shortly thereafter, however, he suspended himself from office for the sin of yielding to the royal will in the matter. Although he failed to obtain full papal support at this stage, Alexander III ultimately came to his aid over the Constitutions. Later in 1164 Becket was charged with peculation of royal funds when chancellor. After Becket had taken flight for France, the king confiscated the revenues of his province, exiled his friends, and confiscated their revenues. In 1170 Henry had his eldest son crowned king by the archbishop of York, not Canterbury, as was traditional. Becket, in exile, appealed to Rome and excommunicated the clergy who had taken part in the ceremony. A reconciliation between Becket and Henry at the end of the same year settled none of the points at issue. When Becket returned to England, he took further measures against the clergy who had taken part in the coronation. In Normandy the enraged king, hearing the news, burst out with the fateful words that incited four of his knights to take ship for England and murder the archbishop in Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
                <p>Almost overnight the martyred Thomas became a saint in the eyes of the people. Henry repudiated responsibility for the murder and reconciled himself with the church. But despite various royal promises to abolish customs injurious to the church, royal control of the church was little affected. Henceforth criminous clerks were to be tried in church courts, save for offenses against the forest laws. Disputes over ecclesiastical patronage and church lands that were held on the same terms as lay estates were, however, to come under royal jurisdiction. Finally Henry did penance at Canterbury, allowing the monks to scourge him. But with Becket out of the way, it proved possible to negotiate most of the points at issue between church and state. The martyred archbishop, however, was to prove a potent example for future prelates.</p>

Various methods of raising money were tried: an aid, or scutage; a carucage, or tax on plow lands; a general tax of a fourth of revenues and chattels (this was a development of the so-called Saladin Tithe raised earlier for the Crusade); and a seizure of the wool crop of Cistercian and Gilbertine houses. The ransom, although never paid in full, caused Richard’s government to become highly unpopular. Richard also faced some unwillingness on the part of his English subjects to serve in France. A plan to raise a force of 300 knights who would serve for a whole year met with opposition led by the bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury. Richard was, however, remarkably successful in mustering the resources, financial and human, of his kingdom in support of his wars. It can also be argued that his demands on England weakened the realm unduly and that Richard left his successor a very difficult legacy.

In addition he surrendered his kingdom to the pope, receiving it back as a fief from the pope. He now had an able ally at no great cost in terms of concessions on his part.

It is thorny with problems of feudal law and custom that are largely untranslatable into modern idiom. Still, it was remarkable in many ways, not least because it was not written in a purely baronial interest but aimed to provide protection for all freemen. It was an attempt to provide guarantees against the sort of arbitrary disregard of feudal right that the three Angevin kings had made familiar. The level of reliefs, for example, was set at £100 for a barony. Some clauses derived from concessions already offered by the king in efforts to divide opposition. The celebrated clause 39, which promised judgment by peers or by the law of the land to all freemen, had its origins in a letter sent by Innocent III to the king. The barons, however, were not attempting to dismantle royal government; in fact, many of the legal reforms of Henry II’s day were reinforced. Nor did they seek to legitimate rebellion but rather they tried to ensure that the king was beneath rather than above the law. In immediate terms Magna Carta was a failure, for it was no more than a stage in ineffective negotiations to prevent civil war. John was released by the pope from his obligations under it. The document was, however, reissued with some changes under John’s son, with papal approval, and so it became, in its 1225 version, a part of the permanent law of the land. John himself died in October 1216, with the civil war still at an inconclusive stage.

There was a marked price and wage inflation. Daily wages for a knight rose from eight pence a day early in Henry II’s day to two shillings under John. Landlords who relied upon fixed rents found times difficult, but most responded by taking manors into their own hands and by profiting from direct sales of demesne produce at market. A new class of professional estate managers, or stewards, began to appear. Towns continued to prosper, and many bought privileges of self-government from Richard I and John.

Further political crises in 1238 and 1244 did nothing to resolve tensions. In 1238 the king’s brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall, rebelled, and leading advisers such as William of Savoy left the royal council. In 1244 Henry III faced opposition in Parliament from both lay and ecclesiastical magnates. A draft proposal suggested a complex system for adding four men to the council, who were to be “conservators of liberties” as well as overseers of royal finance. The king was able, however, to exploit the differences between his opponents, and their campaign achieved little. Henry was naive; he was, on the one hand, overly trustful and, on the other, bitter against those who betrayed his trust. There was growing discontent at a local level with the conduct of royal government.

The Savoyard and Lusignan court factions were divided; there were reverses in Wales; the costs of the Sicilian affair were mounting; and there was perceived to be a crisis in local government. In May 1258 the king was compelled to agree to a meeting of Parliament and to the appointment of a joint committee of dissident barons and his own supporters, 12 from each side, which was to recommend measures for the reform of the kingdom.

The new justiciar was to hear complaints throughout the country against royal officials. Sheriffs were to be local men, appointed for one year. The households of the king and queen were to be reformed. The drafting of further measures took time. In October 1259 a group calling itself the Community of Bachelors, which seems to have claimed to represent the lesser vassals and knights, petitioned for the fulfillment of the promises of the magnates and king to remedy its grievances. As a result the Provisions of Westminster were duly published, comprising detailed legal measures that in many cases were in the interests of the knightly class.

                  The Provisions of Oxford led to two years in which the king was under tutelage; he was less even than the first among equals because he was not free to choose his own councillors.

                  Civil war was inevitable. In May 1264 Simon won a resounding victory at Lewes, and a new form of government was set up. Representatives of the boroughs were summoned to Parliament for the first time early in 1265, along with knights of the shire. Simon’s motive for summoning Parliament was undoubtedly political: he needed support from many elements of society. In May 1265 the young Edward, held hostage since 1264 to ensure fulfillment of the terms of the peace of Lewes, escaped and rallied the royalist forces, notably the Welsh marcher lords who played a decisive part throughout these conflicts.

He deprived Simon’s supporters of their lands, but “the Disinherited” fought back from redoubts in forests or fens. The garrison of Kenilworth Castle carried on a notable resistance. Terms were set in 1266 for former rebels to buy back their lands, and with the issue of the Statute of Marlborough, which renewed some of the reform measures of the Provisions of Westminster, the process of reconstruction began. By 1270 the country was sufficiently settled for Edward to be able to set off on crusade, from which he did not return until two years after his father’s death. By then the community of the realm was ready to begin working with, not against, the crown.</p>

In 1275 the First Statute of Westminster was issued. A succession of other statutes followed in later years, providing a kind of supplement to the <xref refid="0"

                  Edward began his reign with heavy debts incurred on crusade, and his various wars also were costly. In 1275 Edward gained a secure financial basis when he negotiated a grant of export duties on wool, woolfells, and hides that brought in an average of £10,000 a year. He borrowed extensively from Italian bankers on the security of these customs revenues. The system of levying taxes on an assessment of the value of movable goods was also of great value. Successive profitable taxes were granted, mostly in Parliament. It was partly in return for one such tax, in 1290, that Edward expelled the <xref refid="0"

                <headtitle>The growth of Parliament</headtitle>
                <p>Edward fostered the concept of the community of the realm and the practice of calling representative knights of the shire and burgesses from the towns to Parliament. Representatives were needed to give consent to taxation, as well as to enhance communication between the king and his subjects. The process of petitioning the king and his council in Parliament was greatly encouraged. Historians have argued much about the nature of Edward’s Parliament, some seeing the dispensation of justice as the central element, others emphasizing the multifaceted character of an increasingly complex institution. Some see Edward as responding to the dictates of Roman law, while others interpret the development of Parliament in terms of the practical solution of financial and political problems. Historians used to refer to the 1295 assembly as the Model Parliament because it contained all the elements later associated with the word parliament, but in fact these can all be found earlier. The writs to the sheriffs asking them to call knights and burgesses did, however, reach a more or less final form in 1295. They were to be summoned “with full and sufficient authority on behalf of themselves and the community . . . to do whatever shall be ordained by common counsel.” Representatives of the lower clergy were also summoned. This Parliament was fully representative of local communities and of the whole community of the realm, but many Parliaments were attended solely by the magnates with no representatives present.</p>

The scale of infantry recruitment increased notably, enabling Edward to muster armies up to 30,000 strong.

Towns continued to grow, with many new ones being founded, but the weaving industry suffered a decline, in part because of competition from rural areas and in part as a result of restrictive guild practices. In trade, England became increasingly dependent on exports of raw wool.

              The 14th century, despite some gains, was a bleak age. At its beginning and close were kings whose reigns ended in failure. In between, however, came the 50-year reign of the popular and successful Edward III. During the century the importance of the Commons in Parliament continued to grow. But dominant factors of the age were war and plague. The increased scale, cost, and frequency of wars from the 1290s onward imposed heavy burdens on state and society. Conflicts between England and France continued intermittently throughout the century, those from 1337 onward being called the Hundred Years’ War. The Black Death struck in 1348–49; it became endemic, recurring several times in the second half of the century, and brought with it profound economic and <xref refid="0"

                Edward II’s reign was an almost unmitigated disaster. He inherited some of his problems from his father, the most significant being a treasury deficit of some £200,000, and the Scottish war. He inherited none of his father’s strengths. He was a good horseman but did not enjoy swordplay or tournaments, preferring swimming, ditch digging, thatching, and theatricals.

              <p>Historians used to emphasize the constitutional struggle that took place in this reign, seeing a conflict between a baronial ideal of government conducted with the advice of the magnates and based on the great offices of state, the Chancery and the Exchequer, on the one hand, and a royal policy of reliance upon the departments of the royal household, notably the wardrobe and chamber, on the other. More recent interpretations have shifted the emphasis to personal rivalries and ambitions.</p>
              <p>
                Opposition to Edward began to build as early as January 1308. At the coronation in February a new clause was added to the king’s oath that obligated him to promise that he would keep such laws “as the community of the realm shall have chosen.” In April the barons came armed to Parliament and warned the king that “homage and the oath of allegiance are stronger and bind more by reason of the crown than by reason of the person of the king.” The first phase of the reign culminated in the production of the Ordinances in 1311. They were in part directed against Gaveston—who was again to be exiled—and other royal favourites, but much of the document looked back to the grievances of Edward I’s later years, echoing concessions made by the king in 1300. Hostility was expressed to the practice of prise (<xref refid="0"

It is noteworthy that the first clear statement that consent should be given in Parliament is to be found in the Ordinances. No explicit role, however, was given to the Commons, the representative element in Parliament.

                A conciliar regime was set up with the Treaty of Leake of 1318. This was once thought to have been the work of a “middle party,” but the political alliances of this period cannot be categorized in such a manner. New royal favourites emerged, and in 1321 the peace was broken when the Welsh marcher lords moved against two of them, a father and son, both called Hugh Despenser. When Parliament met, the two were exiled, but they soon returned. In this brief civil war, which ended in 1322, Edward was victorious. He had Lancaster executed for treason after his ignominious defeat at Boroughbridge in 1322. In death Lancaster attracted a popular sympathy he had rarely received in life, with many rumours of miracles at his tomb. Edward had many of Lancaster’s followers executed in a horrific bloodbath. In the same year the Ordinances were repealed in Parliament at York, and in the Statute of York the intention of returning to the constitutional practices of the past was announced. But in specifying that the “consent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and of the community of the realm” was required for legislation, the Statute of York provided much scope for historical argument; some historians have made claims for a narrow baronial interpretation of what is meant by “community of the realm,” while others have seen the terminology as giving the representative element in Parliament a new role. A tract written in this period, the <e>Modus tenendi parliamentum</e>, certainly placed a new emphasis on the representatives of shire, borough, and lower clergy. In terms of practical politics, however, the Statute of York permitted the fullest resumption of royal authority.

                The final period of the reign saw the Despensers restored to power. They carried out various administrative reforms, ably assisted by the treasurer, Walter Stapledon. For the first time in many years, a substantial treasury of about £60,000 was built up. At the same time, crude blackmail and blatant corruption characterized this regime.

After two conspiracies to release him, he was almost certainly killed in Berkeley Castle.

                  The initial phase of the war was inconclusive. Edward won a naval victory at Sluys in 1340, but he lacked the resources to follow it up.

A major campaign in 1359–60, planned as the decisive blow, proved unsatisfactory to the English. Rheims did not open its gates to Edward as he had hoped, and a storm caused severe damage to the army and its baggage in April 1360. Negotiations led to a truce at Brétigny, and in the subsequent negotiations Edward agreed to drop his claim to the French throne. In return, English possessions in France would be held in full sovereignty. The terms, particularly those involving the exchange of territory, were not carried out in full, but neither side wished to reopen the war immediately. War was costly, and Edward III’s armies were no longer recruited by feudal means. Most were formed by contract, and all who fought received wages as well as a share of the profits of campaigning. These could be substantial if wealthy nobles were captured and ransomed.

                  The war, and the need to finance it, dominated domestic affairs under Edward III. The king faced a crisis in 1340–41 because he found himself disastrously indebted by 1339, even though he had received generous grants from Parliament since 1336. It was estimated that he owed £300,000. He had seized wool exports and had borrowed recklessly from Italian, English, and Flemish bankers and merchants. A grant in 1340 of a ninth of all produce failed to yield the expected financial return. In the autumn of 1340 Edward returned from abroad and charged John Stratford, <xref refid="0"

Stratford whipped up opposition to the king, and in Parliament in 1341 statutes were passed that were reminiscent of the kind of restraints put on earlier and less popular kings. Officers of state and of the king’s household were to be appointed and sworn in Parliament. Commissioners were to be sworn in Parliament to audit the royal accounts. Peers were to be entitled to trial before their peers in Parliament. Breaches of the Charters were to be reported in Parliament. Charges were brought against Stratford, only to be dropped. But in 1343 Edward III was able to repudiate the statutes. The crisis had little permanent effect, though it did demonstrate the king’s dependence on Parliament, and within it on the Commons, for supply.

                  In the following years the country was well governed, with William Edington and John Thoresby serving the king loyally and well. Edward’s compliance toward the requests of the Commons made it relatively easy for him to obtain the grants he needed. Discontent in 1346–47 was overcome by the good news from France. Much of the legislation passed at this time was in the popular interest. In 1352 the king agreed that no one should be bound to find soldiers for the war save by common consent in Parliament, and demands for purveyance were moderated. The Statute of Provisors of 1351 set up statutory procedures against the unpopular papal practice of making appointments to church benefices in England, and the Statute of Praemunire two years later forbade appeals to Rome in patronage disputes. The crown in practice had sufficient weapons available to it to deal with these matters, but Edward was ready to accept the views of his subjects, even though he did little about them later.

                  The maintenance of law and order, a prime duty for a medieval king, had reached a point of crisis by the end of Edward I’s reign when special commissions, known as commissions of trailbaston, were set up to try to deal with the problem. Matters became worse under Edward II, from whose reign there is much evidence of gang warfare, often involving men of knightly status. Maintaining law and order was also an urgent issue in Edward III’s reign. In the early years there was conflict between the magnates, who wanted to be given full authority in the localities, and the county knights and gentry, who favoured locally appointed keepers of the peace. A possible solution, favoured by the chief justice, Geoffrey Scrope, was to extend the jurisdiction of the king’s bench into the localities. There was a major <xref refid="0"

The justices reacted by greatly extending the use of accusations of treason, but the Commons protested against procedures they claimed did little to promote order and much to impoverish the people. In 1352 the crown gave way, producing in the Statute of Treason a narrow definition of great treason that made it impossible to threaten common criminals with the harsh penalties which followed conviction for treason.

When the so-called Good Parliament met in 1376, grievances had accumulated and needed to be dealt with. As in previous crises, a committee consisting of four bishops, four earls, and four barons was set up to take responsibility for the reforms. Then, under the leadership of Peter de la Mare, who may be termed the first Speaker, the Commons impeached Latimer, Alice Perrers, and a number of ministers and officials, some of whom had profited personally from the administration of the royal finances. The Commons took the role of prosecutors before the Lords in what amounted to a new procedure.

                <p>John of Gaunt, an unpopular figure at this time, had, as a result of the king’s illness, presided uncomfortably over the Good Parliament. He ensured that the achievement of Peter de la Mare and his colleagues was ephemeral, taking charge of the government at the end of the reign. De la Mare was jailed in Nottingham. William of Wykeham was attacked for alleged peculation as chancellor, and Alice Perrers was restored to court. The Parliament of 1377 reversed all important acts of the Good Parliament. There were rumours in London that Gaunt aimed at the throne. But the Black Prince’s widow made peace between Gaunt and the Londoners, and Wykeham’s temporalities were restored. The reign ended in truce, if not peace.</p>

A “continual council” was set up to “govern the king and his kingdom.” Although John of Gaunt was still the dominant figure in the royal family, neither he nor his brothers were included.</p>

It proved inequitable and impractical, and, when the government tried to speed up collection in the spring of 1381, a popular rebellion—the Peasants’ Revolt—ensued. Although the poll tax was the spark that set it off, there were also deeper causes related to changes in the economy and to political developments. The government, in particular, engendered hostility to the legal system by its policies of expanding the powers of the justices of the peace at the expense of local and <xref refid="0"

Widespread outbreaks occurred through the southeast of England, taking the form of assaults on tax collectors, attacks on landlords and their manor houses, destruction of documentary evidence of villein status, and attacks on lawyers. Attacks on religious houses, such as that at St. Albans, were particularly severe, perhaps because they had been among the most conservative of landlords in commuting labour services.

                  Soon after putting down the Peasants’ Revolt, Richard began to build up a court party, partly in opposition to Gaunt. A crisis was precipitated in 1386 when the king asked Parliament for a grant to meet the French threat. Parliament responded by demanding the dismissal of the king’s favourites, but Richard insisted that he would not dismiss so much as a scullion in his kitchen at the request of Parliament.

                  Richard was chastened, but he began to recover his authority as early as the autumn of 1388 at the Cambridge Parliament. Declaring himself to be of age in 1389, Richard announced that he was taking over the government. He pardoned the Lords Appellant and ruled with some moderation until 1394, when his queen, Anne of Bohemia, died. After putting down a rebellion in Ireland, he was, for a time, almost popular. He began to implement his personal policy once more and rebuilt a royal party with the help of a group of young nobles. He made a 28-year truce with France and married the French king’s seven-year-old daughter. He built up a household of faithful servants, including the notorious Sir John Bushy, Sir William Bagot, and Sir Henry Green. He enlisted household troops and built a wide network of “king’s knights” in the counties, distributing to them his personal badge, the White <xref refid="0"

Richard’s rule, based on fear rather than consent, became increasingly tyrannical. Three of the Lords Appellant of 1388 were arrested in July and tried in Parliament. The Earl of <xref refid="0"

Richard was granted the customs revenues for life, and the powers of Parliament were delegated to a committee after the assembly was dissolved. Richard also built up a power base in Cheshire.
                </p>
                <p>Events leading to Richard’s downfall followed quickly. The Duke of Norfolk and Henry Bolingbroke, John of Gaunt’s son, accused each other of treason and were banished, the former for life, the latter for 10 years. When Gaunt himself died early in 1399, Richard confiscated his estates instead of allowing his son to claim them. Richard, seemingly secure, went off to Ireland. Henry, however, landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire to claim, as he said, his father’s estates and the hereditary stewardship. The Percys, the chief lords in the north, welcomed him. Popular support was widespread, and when Richard returned from Ireland his cause was lost.</p>
                <p>
                  The precise course of events is hard to reconstruct, in view of subsequent alterations to the records. A Parliament was called in Richard’s name, but before it was fully assembled at the end of September, its members were presented with Richard’s alleged abdication and Henry’s claim to the throne as legitimate descendant of Henry III as well as by right of conquest. Thirty-three articles of deposition were set forth against Richard, and his abdication and deposition were duly accepted. Richard died at <xref refid="0"

Whether or not Richard had been motivated by new theories about the nature of monarchy, as some have claimed, he had failed in the practical measures necessary to sustain his power. He had tried to rule through fear and mistrust in his final years, but he had neither gained sufficient support among the magnates by means of patronage nor created a popular basis of support in the shires.

Economic expansion, which had been characteristic of the 13th century, had slowed to a halt. The Black Death, possibly a combination of bubonic and pneumonic plagues, carried off from one-third to one-half of the population. In some respects it took time for its effects to become detrimental to the economy, but with subsequent outbreaks, as in 1361 and 1369, the population declined further, causing a severe labour shortage. By the 1370s wages had risen dramatically and prices of foodstuffs fallen. Hired labourers, being fewer, asked for higher wages and better food, and peasant tenants, also fewer, asked for better conditions of tenure when they took up land. Some landlords responded by trying to reassert labour services where they had been commuted. The Ordinance (1349) and Statute (1351) of Labourers tried to set maximum wages at the levels of the pre-Black Death years, but strict enforcement proved impossible. The <xref refid="0"

It appears that even in politics and administration much was done that anticipated the achievements of the Tudors, while in the economy the foundations for future growth and prosperity were laid.</p>

                Henry of Lancaster gave promise of being able to develop a better rapport with his people than his predecessor, Richard II. He was a warrior of great renown who had traveled to Jerusalem and had fought in Prussia against infidels. He also had a reputation for affability and for statesmanlike self-control, and he had won his crown with the support of “the estates of the realm.” It did not matter much whether that meant Parliament or something more vague and symbolic. Henry, however, intended to rule as a true king, with the prerogatives of the crown unimpaired, whereas his Parliaments, from the first, expected him to govern with the advice and consent of his council, and to listen to Parliament regarding requests for money. Thus although Archbishop <xref refid="0"

                <p>Henry’s relations with his Parliaments were uneasy. The main problem, of course, was money. Henry, as Duke of Lancaster, was a wealthy man, but as king he had forfeited some of his income by repudiating Richard II’s tactics, though he also avoided Richard’s extravagance. His needs were still great, threatened as he was by rebellion in England and war in France. A central issue was Parliament’s demand, as in 1404, that the king take back all royal land that had been granted and leased out since 1366. This was so that he might “live of his own.” The king could hardly adopt a measure that would cause much upheaval. Arguments in 1406 were so protracted that the Parliament met for 159 days, becoming the longest Parliament of the medieval period. On several occasions the Commons insisted on taxes being spent in the way that they wished, primarily on the defense of the realm.</p>
                <p>The later Parliaments of Henry’s reign brought no new problems, but the king became less active in government as he was more and more incapacitated by illness. From 1408 to 1411 the government was dominated first by Archbishop Arundel and then by the king’s son Henry, who, with the support of the Beaufort brothers, sons of John of Gaunt by Katherine Swynford, attempted to win control over the council. There was much argument over the best political strategy to adopt in France, where civil war was raging; young Henry wanted to resume the war in France, but the king favoured peace. In 1411 the king recovered his authority, and the Prince of Wales was dismissed from the council. Uneasy relations between the prince and his father lasted until Henry IV’s death in 1413.</p>

                <p>The so-called Wars of the Roses was the struggle between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of Edward III for control of the throne and of local government. The origins of the conflict have been the subject of much debate. It can be seen as brought about as a result of Henry VI’s inadequacy and the opposition of his dynastic rival Richard, Duke of York, but local feuds between magnates added a further dimension. Because of the crown’s failure to control these disputes, they acquired national significance. Attempts have been made to link these civil conflicts to what is known as “bastard feudalism,” the system that allowed magnates to retain men in their service by granting them fees and livery and made possible the recruiting of private armies. Yet this system can be seen as promoting stability in periods of strong rule as well as undermining weak rule such as that of Henry VI. Many nobles sought good government, rather than being factious, and were only forced into war by the king’s incompetence. The outbreak of civil war in England was indirectly linked to the failure in France, for Henry VI’s government had suffered a disastrous loss of prestige and, with it, authority.</p>

One was through his mother, great-granddaughter of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of Edward III, and the other was through his father, son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, fourth surviving son of Edward III. According to feudal principles he had a better hereditary right than anyone of the Lancastrian line. He had been sent as royal lieutenant to Ireland in 1446, but he returned from there with 4,000 men in 1450 to reassert his right to participate in the king’s council and to counter Somerset’s machinations. In 1454 York was made protector of the king, who had become insane in 1453, even though the queen and court party had tried to disguise the king’s illness. Early in 1455 Henry recovered his wits. During his spell of insanity his queen had a son, Edward, which changed the balance of politics. York was no longer the heir apparent, and the country was faced with the prospect, should the king die, of another lengthy minority.

                During the early years of his reign, from 1461 to 1470, Edward was chiefly concerned with putting down opposition to his rule. Lancastrian resistance in the northeast and in Wales caused problems. France and Burgundy were also of concern because Margaret of Anjou’s chief hope of recovering Lancastrian fortunes lay in French support; but <xref refid="0"

              <p>The second half of Edward’s reign, 1471–83, was a period of relative order, peace, and security. The one event reminiscent of the politics of the early reign was the trial of the Duke of Clarence, who was attainted in Parliament in 1478 and put to death, reputedly by drowning in a butt of Malmsey wine. But Edward was popular. Because his personal resources from the duchy of York were considerable and because he agreed early in his reign to acts of resumption whereby former royal estates were taken back into royal hands, Edward had a large personal income and was less in need of parliamentary grants than his predecessors had been. Thus he levied few subsidies and called Parliament only six times. Among the few subsidies Edward did levy were benevolences, supposedly voluntary gifts, from his subjects primarily to defray the expenses of war. In 1475 Edward took an army to France but accepted a pension from the French king for not fighting, thereby increasing his financial independence still further. Councils were set up to govern in the Marches of Wales and in the north, where Edward’s brother Richard presided efficiently. Edward’s rule was characterized by the use of his household, its servants, and its departments, such as the chamber. He was a pragmatic ruler, whose greatest achievement was to restore the prestige of the monarchy. Where he failed was to make proper provision for the succession after his death.</p>

                Richard was readily accepted no doubt because of his reputed ability and because people feared the insecurity of a long minority. The tide began to turn against him in October 1483, when it began to be rumoured that he had murdered or connived at the murder of his nephews. Whether this was true or not matters less than the fact that it was thought to be true and that it obscured the king’s able government during his brief reign. Legislation against benevolences and protection for English merchants and craftsmen did little to counteract his reputation as a treacherous friend and a wicked uncle. Rebellion failed in 1483.

              <p>Central to all social change in the 15th century was change in the economy. Although plague remained endemic in England, there was little change in the level of population. Villein labour service largely disappeared, to be replaced by copyhold tenure (tenure by copy of the record of the manorial court). The period has been considered a golden age for the English labourer, but individual prosperity varied widely. There was a well-developed land market among peasants, some of whom managed to rise above their neighbours and began to constitute a class called yeomen. Large landlords entirely abandoned direct management of their estates in favour of a leasehold system. In many cases they faced growing arrears of rent and found it difficult to maintain their income levels. Because many landholders solved the problem of labour shortage by converting their holdings to sheep pasture, much land enclosure took place. As a result a great many villages were abandoned by their inhabitants.</p>

Might, not soiled right, had won out on the high ground at Bosworth Field, and Henry VII claimed his title by conquest. The new king wisely sought to fortify his doubtful genealogical pretension, however, first by parliamentary acclamation and then by royal marriage. The Parliament of November 1485 did not confer regal power on the first Tudor monarch—victory in war had already done that—but it did acknowledge Henry as “our new sovereign lord.” Then, on Jan. 18, 1486, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting “the white rose and the red” and launching England upon a century of “smooth-fac’d peace with smiling plenty.”

                “God’s fair ordinance,” which Shakespeare and later generations so clearly observed in the events of 1485–86, was not limited to military victory, parliamentary sanction, and a fruitful marriage; the hidden hand of economic, social, and intellectual change was also on Henry’s side. The day was coming when the successful prince would be more praised than the heroic monarch and the solvent sovereign more admired than the pious one. Henry Tudor was probably no better or worse than the first Lancastrian, Henry IV; they both worked diligently at their royal craft and had to fight hard to keep their crowns, but the seventh Henry achieved what the fourth had not—a secure and permanent dynasty—because England in 1485 was moving into a period of unprecedented <xref refid="0"

Contemporaries blamed inflation on human greed and only slowly began to perceive that rising prices were the result of inflationary pressures brought on by the increase in population, international war, and the flood of gold and silver arriving from the New World.

A surfeit of land, a labour shortage, low rents, and high wages, which had prevailed throughout the early 15th century as a consequence of economic depression and reduced population, were replaced by a land shortage, a labour surplus, high rents, and declining wages.

To these essentially statutory steps he added efficiency of rent collection. In 1485 income from <xref refid="0"

At the same time, the Tudors profited from the growing economic prosperity of the realm, and annual customs receipts rose from more than £20,000 to an average of £40,000 by the time Henry died.

                  The increase in customs and land revenues was applauded, for it meant fewer parliamentary subsidies and fit the medieval formula that kings should live on their own, not parliamentary, income. But the collection of revenues from feudal and prerogative sources and from the administration of justice caused great discontent and earned Henry his reputation as a miser and extortionist. Generally, Henry demanded no more than his due as the highest feudal overlord, and, a year after he became sovereign, he established a commission to look into land tenure to discover who held property by knight’s fee—that is, by obligation to perform military services. Occasionally he overstepped the bounds of feudal decency and abused his rights. In 1504, for instance, he levied a feudal aid (tax) to pay for the knighting of his son—who had been knighted 15 years before and had been dead for two.

                  To fiscal feudalism Henry VII added rigorous administration of justice.

Nevertheless, as soon as it became clear that nothing could prevent France from absorbing the duchy, Henry negotiated the unheroic but financially rewarding Treaty of Étaples in 1492, whereby he disclaimed all historic rights to French territory (except Calais) in return for an indemnity of £159,000. By fair means or foul, when the first Tudor died, his total nonparliamentary annual income had risen at least twofold and stood in the neighbourhood of £113,000 (some estimates put it as high as £142,000). From land alone the king received £42,000, while the greatest landlord in the realm had to make do with less than £5,000; economically speaking, there were no longer any overmighty magnates.

                <p>The Tudors sought to enforce law in every corner of their kingdom, and step by step the blurred medieval profile of a realm shattered by semiautonomous franchises, in which local law and custom were obeyed more than the king’s law, was transformed into the clear outline of a single state filled with loyal subjects obeying the king’s decrees. By 1500 royal government had been extended into the northern counties and Wales by the creation of the Council of the North and the Council for the Welsh Marches. The Welsh principalities had always been difficult to control, and it was not until 1536 that Henry VIII brought royal law directly into Wales and incorporated the 136 self-governing lordships into a greater England with five new shires.</p>

He sought to tame both the lords temporal and the lords spiritual—administering to the nobility the “new law of the Star Chamber,” protecting the rights of the underprivileged in the poor men’s Court of Requests, and teaching the abbots and bishops that they were subjects as well as ecclesiastical princes. Long before Henry assumed full power over his subjects’ souls as well as their bodies, his servant had marked the way. The cardinal’s administration, however, was stronger on promise than on performance, and, for all his fine qualities and many talents, he exposed himself to the accusation that he prostituted policy for pecuniary gain and personal pride.

The need for a male heir was paramount, for the last queen of England, Matilda, in the 12th century, had been a disaster, and there was no reason to believe that another would be any better. Finally, there was the question of the king’s conscience. Henry had married his brother’s widow, and, though the pope had granted a dispensation, the fact of the matter remained that every male child born to Henry and Catherine had died, proof of what was clearly written in the Bible: “If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless” (Leviticus 20:21).

But slowly, reluctantly, and not realizing the full consequences of his actions, he moved step by step to open defiance and a total break with Rome. Wolsey, in his person and his policies, had represented the past. He was the last of the great ecclesiastical statesmen who had been as much at home in the cosmopolitan world of European Christendom, with its spiritual centre in Rome, as in a provincial capital such as London. By the time of Henry’s matrimonial crisis, Christendom was dissolving. Not only were late medieval kingdoms assuming the character of independent nation-states, but the spiritual unity of Christ’s seamless cloak was also being torn apart by heresy. Henry possibly would never have won his annulment had there not existed in England men who desired a break with Rome, not because it was dynastically expedient but because they regarded the pope as the “whore of Babylon.”</p>

                  Precisely because of the religiosity of the people, there was a growing volume of complaint about clerical absenteeism and pluralism in general and about the unavailability of the bishops in particular. Many prelates served as the top civil servants of the crown rather than as shepherds of Christ’s flock. And as inflation began to take off, so did attempts by clerics to maximize their incomes by a rather ruthless determination to collect everything to which they were entitled—such as the “best beasts” demanded as mortuary fees from grieving and impoverished parents of dead children.

The powerful force of the “Word” took hold of some and made the mumbling of prayers, the billowing of incense, and the selling of indulgences to rescue souls from the due penalty of their sins seem the stuff of idolatry and not of true worship. But in 1532, when Henry VIII began to contemplate a schism from Rome, embracing Protestantism was the last thing on his mind, and very few of his subjects would have wished him to do so.

The so-called Reformation Parliament that first met in November 1529 was unprecedented; it lasted seven years, enacted 137 statutes (32 of which were of vital importance), and legislated in areas that no medieval Parliament had ever dreamed of entering. “King in Parliament” became the revolutionary instrument by which the medieval church was destroyed.

                  Cranmer was a friend of the annulment, but, before he could oblige his sovereign, the queen’s right of appeal from the archbishop’s court to Rome had to be destroyed; this could be done only by cutting the constitutional cords holding England to the papacy. Consequently, in April 1533 the crucial statute was enacted; the Act of Restraint of Appeals boldly decreed that “this realm of England is an empire.” A month later an obliging archbishop heard the case and adjudged the king’s marriage to be null and void.

                  Though the monasteries bowed to the royal supremacy, the government continued to view them with suspicion, arguing that they had obeyed only out of fear, and their destruction got under way early in 1536. In the name of fiscal reform and efficiency, foundations with endowments of under £200 a year (nearly 400 of them) were dissolved on the grounds that they were too small to do their job effectively.

By 1539 the foundations, both great and small, were gone. Moreover, property constituting at least 13 percent of the land of England and Wales was nationalized and incorporated into the crown lands, thereby almost doubling the government’s normal peacetime, nonparliamentary income.

                  Had those estates remained in the possession of the crown, English history might have been very different, for the kings of England would have been able to rule without calling upon Parliament, and the constitutional authority that evolved out of the crown’s fiscal dependence on Parliament would never have developed. For better or for worse, Henry and his descendants had to sell the profits of the Reformation, and by 1603 three-fourths of the monastic loot had passed into the hands of the landed gentry. The legend of a “golden shower” is false; monastic property was never given away at bargain prices, nor was it consciously presented to the kingdom in order to win the support of the ruling elite. Instead, most—though not all—of the land was sold at its fair market value to pay for Henry’s wars and <xref refid="0"

The king successfully survived four more matrimonial experiments, the enmity of every major power in Europe, and an international war. On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn’s career was terminated by the executioner’s ax. She had failed in her promise to produce further children to secure the succession. Her enemies poisoned the king’s mind against her with accusations of multiple adulteries. The king’s love turned to hatred, but what sealed the queen’s fate was probably the death of her rival, Catherine of Aragon, on Jan. 8, 1536. From that moment it was clear that, should Henry again marry, whoever was his wife, the children she might bear would be legitimate in the eyes of Roman Catholics and Protestants alike.

                  </thumbasm>By the time Henry died (Jan. 28, 1547), medievalism had nearly vanished. The crown stood at the pinnacle of its power, able to demand and receive a degree of obedience from both great and small that no medieval monarch had been able to achieve. The measure of that authority was threefold: (1) the extent to which Henry had been able to thrust a very unpopular annulment and supremacy legislation down the throat of Parliament, (2) his success in raising unprecedented sums of money through taxation, and (3) his ability to establish a new church on the ashes of the old. It is difficult to say whether these feats were the work of the king or his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. The will was probably Henry’s and the parliamentary means his minister’s, but, whoever was responsible, by 1547 England had come a long way on the road of Reformation. The crown had assumed the authority of the papacy without as yet fundamentally changing the old creed, but the ancient structure was severely shaken. Throughout England men were arguing that because the pontiff had been proved false, the entire Roman Catholic creed was suspect, and the cry went up to “get rid of the poison with the author.” It was not long before every aspect of Roman Catholicism was under attack—the miracle of the mass whereby the bread and wine are transformed into the glorified body and blood of Christ (<e>see</e> <xref refid="1842161"

                  Henry never worked out a consistent religious policy: the Ten Articles of 1536 and the <e>Bishop’s Book</e> of the following year tended to be somewhat Lutheran in tone; the Six Articles of 1539, or the Act for Abolishing Diversity of Opinion, and the<e> King’s Book</e> of 1543 were mildly Roman Catholic. Whatever the religious colouring, Henry’s ecclesiastical <e>via media</e> was based on obedience to an authoritarian old king and on subjects who were expected to live “soberly, justly and devoutly.” Unfortunately for the religious, social, and political peace of the kingdom, both these conditions disappeared the moment Henry died and a nine-year-old boy sat upon the throne.

Somerset ruled in loco parentis; the divinity of the crown resided in the boy king, but authority was exercised by an uncle who proved himself to be more merciful than tactful and more idealistic than practical. Sweet reason and tolerance were substituted for the old king’s brutal laws. The treason and heresy acts were repealed or modified, and the result came close to destroying the Tudor state. The moment idle tongues could speak with impunity, the kingdom broke into a chorus of religious and social discord.

Written primarily by Thomas Cranmer, the first prayer book of Edward VI was a literary masterpiece but a political flop, for it failed in its purpose. It sought to bring into a single Protestant fold all varieties of middle-of-the-road religious beliefs by deliberately obscuring the central issue of the exact nature of the mass—whether it was a miraculous sacrament or a commemorative service. <e>The Book of Common Prayer</e> succeeded only in antagonizing Protestants and Roman Catholics alike.
              </p>
              <p>Somerset is best remembered for these religious reforms, but their effectiveness was much blunted by their association with greed. Henry VIII had plundered and dissolved the monasteries and had mounted a half-successful campaign to accuse the monastic communities of corruption, licentiousness, and putting obedience to a foreign power above their obedience to him. Somerset extended the state’s plunder to the parish churches and to the gold and silver piously and generously given by thousands of layfolk for the adornment of the parish churches. Their descendants watched the desecration with sullen anger. The rhetoric of cleansing parish churches of idolatrous and sacrilegious images sounded hollow as wagonloads of gold and silver objects headed toward the smelter’s shop in the lord protector’s backyard.</p>
              <p>
                All this in turn was linked to what has been called Somerset’s <e>idée fixe</e>, the permanent solution to the problem of the Anglo-Scottish frontier. Every time Henry VIII had tried to assert his claims to French territories, kings of Scotland had taken the opportunity to invade England. On each occasion—and especially in 1513 and 1542—the Scottish armies had been humiliated and a high proportion of the nobility killed or captured (James IV had been killed at the<xref refid="1842167"

                Somerset was no more successful in solving the economic and social difficulties of the reign. Rising prices, debasement of the currency, and the cost of war had produced an inflationary crisis in which prices doubled between 1547 and 1549. A false prosperity ensued in which the wool trade boomed, but so also did enclosures with all their explosive potential. The result was social revolution.

At the same time that domestic rebellion was stirring, the protector had to face a political and international crisis, and he proved himself to be neither a farsighted statesman nor a shrewd politician.

In the eyes of the ruling elite, Somerset was responsible for governmental ineptitude and social and religious revolution. The result was inevitable: a palace revolution ensued in October 1549, in which he was arrested and deprived of office, and two and a half years later he was executed on trumped-up charges of treason.

                How long a kingdom still attached to the outward trappings of Roman Catholicism would have tolerated doctrinal radicalism and the plundering of chantry lands and episcopal revenues under Somerset and Northumberland is difficult to say, but in 1553 the ground upon which Northumberland had built his power crumbled: Edward was dying of consumption. To save the kingdom from Roman Catholicism and himself from Roman Catholic Mary, who was Edward’s successor under the terms of a statute of Henry VIII as well as that king’s will, Northumberland—with the support, perhaps even the encouragement, of the dying king—tried his hand at kingmaking.

She worked with and through successive Parliaments to reverse all the statutes that excluded papal jurisdiction from England and to revoke her half-brother’s doctrinal and liturgical reforms; however, she persuaded Rome to allow her to confirm the dissolution of the monasteries and the secularization of church properties.

Pole was recalled to Rome by a hard-line pope and accused of heresy for his previous attempts to achieve an accommodation with Protestantism. Mary’s plans were torpedoed as much by the internal struggle for control of the Roman church as by the strength of Protestant opposition in England. Most potential leaders of a resistance movement had been encouraged by Mary to emigrate and had done so, but there were scores of underground Protestant cells during her reign. In thousands of parish churches, the restored liturgy and worship were welcomed.

Their deaths, however, had the opposite effect; their bravery encouraged others to withstand the flames, and the Smithfield Fires continued to burn because nobody could think of what to do with heretics except put them to death. The law required it, the prisons were overflowing, and the martyrs themselves offered the government no way out except to enforce the grisly laws.

To make matters worse, the new monarch was the wrong sex.

She had survived the palace revolutions of her brother’s reign and the Roman Catholicism of her sister’s; she was the product of a fine Renaissance education, and she had learned the need for strong secular leadership devoid of religious bigotry. Moreover, she possessed her father’s magnetism without his egotism or ruthlessness. She was also her mother’s daughter, and the offspring of Anne Boleyn had no choice but to reestablish the royal supremacy and once again sever the ties with Rome.

Conservative opposition was blunted by entitling the queen “supreme governor,” not “head,” of the church and by combining the words of the 1552 prayer book with the more conservative liturgical actions of the 1549 prayer book. At the same time, many of the old papal trappings of the church were retained. Protestant radicals went along with this compromise in the expectation that the principle of “things indifferent” meant that Elizabeth would, when the political dust had settled, rid her church of the “livery of Antichrist” and discard its “papal rags.” In this they were badly mistaken, for the queen was determined to keep her religious settlement exactly as it had been negotiated in 1559. As it turned out, Roman Catholics proved to be better losers than Protestants: of the 900 parish clergy, only 189 refused to accept Elizabeth as supreme governor, but the Protestant radicals—the future Puritans—were soon at loggerheads with their new sovereign.

The organ that spoke for the entire kingdom was not the king alone but “king in Parliament,” and, when Elizabeth sat in the midst of her Lords and Commons, it was said that “every Englishman is intended to be there present from the prince to the lowest person in England.” The Tudors needed no standing army in “the French fashion” because God’s will and the monarch’s decrees were enshrined in acts of Parliament, and this was society’s greatest defense against rebellion.

Every aspect of government was intimate because it was small and rested on the support of probably no more than 5,000 key persons. The bureaucracy consisted of a handful of privy councillors at the top and possibly 500 paid civil servants at the bottom—the 15 members of the secretariat, the 265 clerks and custom officials of the treasury, a staff of 50 in the judiciary, and approximately 150 more scattered in other departments. Tudor government was not predominantly professional. Most of the work was done by unpaid amateurs: the sheriffs of the shires, the lord lieutenants of the counties, and, above all, the Tudor maids of all work, the 1,500 or so justices of the peace. Meanwhile, each of the 180 “corporate” towns and cities was governed by men chosen locally by a variety of means laid down in the particular royal charter each had been granted.

                  Smallness did not mean lack of government, for the 16th-century state was conceived of as an organic totality in which the possession of land carried with it duties of leadership and service to the throne, and the inferior part of society was obligated to accept the decisions of its elders and betters. The Tudors were essentially medieval in their economic and social philosophy. The aim of government was to curb competition and regulate life so as to attain an ordered and stable society in which all could share according to status. The Statute of Apprentices of 1563 embodied this concept, for it assumed the moral obligation of all men to work, the existence of divinely ordered social distinctions, and the need for the state to define and control all occupations in terms of their utility to society.

                  </thumbasm>Social reality, at least for the poor and powerless, was probably a far cry from the ideal, but for a few years Elizabethan England seemed to possess an extraordinary internal balance and external dynamism. In part the queen herself was responsible. She demanded no windows into men’s souls, and she charmed both great and small with her artistry and tact. In part, however, the Elizabethan Age was a success because men had at their disposal new and exciting areas, both of mind and geography, into which to channel their energies.

                  A revolution in reading (and to a lesser extent writing) was taking place. By 1640 a majority of men, and just possibly a majority of men and women, could read, and there were plenty of things for them to read. In the year that Henry VIII came to the throne (1509), the number of works licensed to be published was 38. In the year of Elizabeth’s accession (1558), it was 77; in the year of her death (1603), it was 328. In the year of Charles I’s execution (1649), the number had risen to 1,383.

These figures do not include the ever-rising tide of broadsheets and ballads that were intended to be posted on the walls of inns and alehouses as well as in other public places. Given that a large proportion of the illiterate population spent at least part of their lives in service in homes with literate members and given that reading in the early modern period was frequently an aural experience—official documents being read aloud in market squares and parish churches and all manner of publications being read aloud to whole households—a very high proportion of the population had direct or indirect access to the printed word.

                  There was very little church building in the century after the Reformation, but there was an unprecedented growth of school building, with grammar schools springing up in most boroughs and in many market towns. By 1600 schools were provided for more than 10 percent of the adolescent population, who were taught Latin and given an introduction to Classical civilization and the foundations of biblical faith. There was also a great expansion of university education; the number of colleges in Oxford and Cambridge doubled in the 16th century, and the number of students went up fourfold to 1,200 by 1640 (<e>see</e> <xref refid="1841847"

Elizabeth Tudor’s virginity was the cause of great international discussion, for every bachelor prince of Europe hoped to win a throne through marriage with Gloriana (the queen of the fairies, as she was sometimes portrayed), and was the source of even greater domestic concern, for everyone except the queen herself was convinced that Elizabeth should marry and produce heirs. The issue was the cause of her first major confrontation with the House of Commons, which was informed that royal matrimony was not a subject for commoners to discuss. Elizabeth preferred maidenhood—it was politically safer and her most useful diplomatic weapon—but it gave poignancy to the intrigues of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots.

In response to this diplomatic and military imbalance, English foreign policy underwent a fundamental change. By the Treaty of Blois in 1572, England gave up its historic enmity with France, accepting by implication that Spain was the greater danger. It is difficult to say at what point a showdown between Elizabeth and her former brother-in-law became unavoidable—there were so many areas of disagreement—but the two chief points were the refusal of English merchants-cum-buccaneers to recognize Philip’s claims to a monopoly of trade wherever the Spanish flag flew throughout the world and the military and financial support given by the English to Philip’s rebellious and heretical subjects in the Netherlands.

What ensued was not the new commander’s fault. He did the best he could in an impossible situation, for Philip’s Armada was invincible in name only. It was technologically and numerically outclassed by an English fleet of close to 200. Worse, its strategic purpose was grounded on a fallacy: that Parma’s troops could be conveyed to England. The Spanish controlled no deepwater port in the Netherlands in which the Armada’s great galleons and Parma’s light troop-carrying barges could rendezvous. Even the Deity seemed to be more English than Spanish, and in the end the fleet, buffeted by gales, was dashed to pieces as it sought to escape home via the northern route around Scotland and Ireland. Of the 130 ships that had left Spain, perhaps 85 crept home; 10 were captured, sunk, or driven aground by English guns, 23 were sacrificed to wind and storm, and 12 others were “lost, fate unknown.”

Both Drake and Hawkins died in 1596 on the same ill-conceived expedition into Spanish Caribbean waters—symbolic proof that the good old days of buccaneering were gone forever. At home the cost of almost two decades of war (£4 million) raised havoc with the queen’s finances. It forced her to sell her capital (about £800,000, or roughly one-fourth of all crown lands) and increased her dependence upon parliamentary sources of income, which rose from an annual average of £35,000 to over £112,000 a year.

                <p>The expedition to the Netherlands was not, however, the most costly component of the protracted conflict; indeed, the privateering war against Spain more than paid for itself. The really costly war of the final years of Elizabeth’s reign was in Ireland, where a major rebellion in response to the exclusion of native Catholics from government and to the exploitation of every opportunity to replace native Catholics with Protestant English planters tied down thousands of English soldiers. The rebellion was exacerbated by Spanish intervention and even by a Spanish invasion force (the element of the Armada that temporarily succeeded). This Nine Years War (1594–1603) was eventually won by the English but only with great brutality and at great expense of men and treasure.</p>

                  Elizabeth’s financial difficulties were a symptom of a mounting political crisis that under her successors would destroy the entire Tudor system of government.

                        tocid="">Parliament</xref>, which was meant to beseech and petition, never to command or initiate. Three things, however, forced theory to make way for reality. First was the government’s financial dependence on the Commons, for the organ that paid the royal piper eventually demanded that it also call the governmental tune. Second, under the Tudors, Parliament had been summoned so often and forced to legislate on such crucial matters of church and state—legitimizing and bastardizing monarchs, breaking with Rome, proclaiming the supreme headship (governorship under Elizabeth), establishing the royal succession, and legislating in areas that no Parliament had ever dared enter before—that the Commons got into the habit of being consulted. Inevitably, a different constitutional question emerged: If Parliament is asked to give authority to the crown, can it also take away that authority? Finally, there was the growth of a vocal, politically conscious, and economically dominant gentry; the increase in the size of the House of Commons reflected the activity and importance of that class. In Henry VIII’s first Parliament, there were 74 knights who sat for 37 shires and 224 burgesses who represented the chartered boroughs and towns of the kingdom. By the end of Elizabeth’s reign, borough representation had been increased by 135 seats. The Commons was replacing the Lords in importance because the social element it represented had become economically and politically more important than the nobility. Should the crown’s leadership falter, there existed by the end of the century an organization that was quite capable of seizing the political initiative, for as one disgruntled contemporary noted: “the foot taketh upon him the part of the head and commons is become a king.” Elizabeth had sense enough to avoid a showdown with the Commons, and she retreated under parliamentary attack on the issue of her prerogative rights to grant monopolies regulating and licensing the economic life of the kingdom, but on the subject of her religious settlement she refused to budge.

During the 1570s and ’80s, “cells” had sprung up to spread God’s word and rejuvenate the land, and Puritan strength was centred in exactly that segment of society that had the economic and social means to control the realm—the gentry and merchant classes. What set a Puritan off from other Protestants was the literalness with which he held to his creed, the discipline with which he watched his soul’s health, the militancy of his faith, and the sense that he was somehow apart from the rest of corrupt humanity. This disciplined spiritual elite clashed with the queen over the purification of the church and the stamping out of the last vestiges of Roman Catholicism. The controversy went to the root of society: Was the purpose of life spiritual or political? Was the role of the church to serve God or the crown? In 1576 two brothers, Paul and <xref refid="1841885"

                  Puritans were a loyal opposition, a church within the church. Elizabethan governments never feared that there would or could be a Puritan insurrection in the way they constantly feared that there could and would be an insurrection by papists. Perhaps 1 in 5 of the peerage, 1 in 10 of the gentry, and 1 in 50 of the population were practicing Catholics, many of them also being occasional conformists in the Anglican church to avoid the severity of the law. Absence from church made householders liable to heavy fines; associating with priests made them liable to incarceration or death. To be a priest in England was itself treasonous; in the second half of the reign, more than 300 Catholics were tortured to death, even more than the number of Protestants burned at the stake by Mary. Some priests, especially <xref refid="1841888"

                  Catholicism posed a political threat to Elizabethan England. Witches posed a cultural threat. From early in Elizabeth’s reign, concern grew that men and (more particularly) women on the margins of society were casting spells on respectable folk with whom they were in conflict. Explanations abound. Accusations seem to have often arisen when someone with wealth denied a request for personal charity to someone in need, with the excuse that the state had now taken over responsibility for institutional relief through the Poor Laws; guilt about this refusal of charity would give way to blaming the poor person who had been turned away for any ensuing misfortunes. Sometimes magisterial encouragement of witchcraft prosecutions was related to the intellectual search for the causes of natural disasters that fell short of an explanation more plausible than the casting of spells. Sometimes there was concern over the existence of “cunning men and women” with inherited knowledge based on a <xref refid="0"

                        tocid="">cosmology</xref> incompatible with the new Protestantism. This was especially the case when the cunning men and women were taking over the casting of spells and incantations that had been the province of the Catholic priest but were not the province of the Protestant minister. Certainly, the rise in incidence of witchcraft trials and executions can be taken as evidence of a society not at peace with itself. As the century ended, there was a crescendo of social unrest and controlled crowd violence. There were riots about the enclosure of common land, about the enforced movement of grain from producing regions to areas of shortage, about high taxes and low wages, and about the volatility of trade. The decades on either side of the turn of the century saw roaring inflation and the first real evidence of the very young and the very old starving to death in remote areas and in London itself. Elizabethan England ended in a rich cultural harvest and real physical misery for people at the two ends of the social scale, respectively.

                  London not only ruled the English mercantile world, but it also dominated the rural economy of the southeast by its insatiable demand for food and clothing. The rural economy was predominately agricultural, with mixed animal and grain husbandry practiced wherever the land allowed. The population increase, however, placed great pressure upon the resources of local communities, and efforts by landlords and tenants to raise productivity for either profit or survival were the key feature of agricultural development. Systematic efforts to grow luxury market crops like wheat, especially in the environs of London, drove many smaller tenants from the land. So too did the practice of enclosure, which allowed for more productive land use by large holders at the expense of their poorer neighbours. There is evidence of a rural subsistence crisis lasting throughout the first two decades of the century. Marginally productive land came under the plow, rural revolts became more common, and harvest failures resulted in starvation rather than hunger, both in London and in the areas remote from the grain-growing lowlands—such as north Wales and the <xref refid="1841894"

This hierarchy was as apparent in the family as it was in the state. In the family, as elsewhere, male domination was the rule; husbands ruled their wives, masters their servants, parents their children. But if hierarchy was stratified, it was not ossified; those who attained wealth could achieve status. The social hierarchy reflected gradations of wealth and responded to changes in the economic fortunes of individuals. In this sense it was more open than most European societies. Old wealth was not preferred to new, and an ancient title conferred no greater privileges than recent elevation; the humble could rise to become gentle, and the gentle could fall to become humble.

                  The monarch ruled personally, and the permanent institutions of government were constantly being reshaped. Around the king was the court, a floating body of royal servants, officeholders, and place seekers. Personal service to the king was considered a social honour and thus fitting to those who already enjoyed rank and privilege. Most of the aristocracy and many gentlemen were in constant attendance at court, some with lucrative offices to defray their expenses, others extravagantly running through their fortunes. There was no essential preparation for royal service, no necessary skills or experiences. Commonly, members of the elite were educated at universities and the <xref refid="0"

It communicated with the host of unpaid local officials who governed in the communities, ordering the justices to enforce statutes or the deputy lieutenants to raise forces. In these tasks the privy councillors relied not only upon the king’s warrant but upon their own local power and prestige as well. Thus, while the king was free to choose his own councillors, he was constrained to pick those who were capable of commanding respect. The advice that he received at the council table was from men who kept one eye on their localities and the other on the needs of central policy.

It had 464 members in 1604 and 507 forty years later. Selection to the House of Commons was a mark of distinction, and many communities rotated the honour among their most important citizens and neighbours. Although there were elaborate regulations governing who could choose and who could be chosen, in fact very few members of the House of Commons were selected competitively. Contests for places were uncommon, and elections in which individual votes were cast were extremely rare.

                <p>Members of Parliament served the dual function of representing the views of the localities to the king and of representing the views of the king to the localities. Most were members of royal government, either at court or in their local communities, and nearly all had responsibility for enforcing the laws that were created at Westminster. Most Parliaments were summoned to provide revenue in times of emergency, usually for defense, and most members were willing to provide it within appropriate limits. They came to Parliament to do the king’s business, the business of their communities, and their own personal business in London. Such conflicting obligations were not always easily resolved, but Parliament was not perceived as an institution in opposition to the king any more than the stomach was seen as opposing the head of the body. There were upsets, however, and, increasingly during the 17th century, king and Parliament clashed over specific issues, but until the middle of the century they were part of one system of royal government.</p>

He wanted common citizenship, the end of trade barriers, and gradual movement toward a union of laws, of institutions, and of churches, although he knew this could not be achieved overnight.

                  To a king whose annual budget in Scotland was barely £50,000, England looked like the land of milk and honey. But in fact James I inherited serious financial problems, which his own liberality quickly compounded. Elizabeth had left a debt of more than £400,000, and James, with a wife and two sons, had much larger household expenses than the unmarried queen. Land and duties from customs were the major sources of royal revenue, and it was James’s good fortune that the latter increased dramatically after the judges ruled in Bate’s case (1606) that the king could make impositions on imported commodities without the consent of Parliament. Two years later, under the direction of James’s able minister <xref refid="1841904"

                  But even this windfall was not enough to stem the effects of inflation on the one hand and James’s own free spending on the other. By 1606 royal debt was more than £600,000, and the crown’s financial ministers had turned their attention to prerogative income from wardships, purveyance, and the discovery of concealed lands (i.e., <xref refid="0"

But at the last moment both royal officials and leaders of the House of Commons backed away from the deal, the government believing that the sum was too low and the leaders of the Commons that a land tax was too unpopular. The failure of the Great Contract drove Salisbury to squeeze even more revenue out of the king’s feudal rights, including the sale of titles. This policy violated the spirit of principles about property and personal liberty held by the governing classes and, along with impositions, was identified as a grievance during James’s first Parliaments.

                  There was much suspicion that the Scottish king would not understand the procedures and privileges of an English Parliament, and this suspicion was reinforced by James’s speeches in the first session of the Parliament of 1604–10.

The Commons reversed a decision by the lord chancellor and ordered Francis Goodwin, an outlaw, to be seated in the House of Commons. James clumsily intervened in the proceedings, stating that the privileges of the Commons had been granted by the grace of the monarch, a pronouncement that stirred the embers of Elizabethan disputes over parliamentary privilege. Although a compromise solution to the case was found, from this time forward the Commons took an active role in scrutinizing the returns of its members. A standing committee on elections was formed, and the freedom of members from arrest during sessions was reasserted. Some wanted to go even further and present the king with a defense of the ancient rights of their house. But this so-called apology was the work of a minority and was never accepted by the whole House of Commons or presented to the king.

                  Buckingham, whose power rested upon his relationship with the king, wholeheartedly supported James’s desire to reestablish peace in Europe.

But some members mistakenly also believed that the king wished their advice on military matters and on the prince’s marriage. When James learned that foreign policy was being debated in the lower house, he rebuked the members for their temerity in breaching the royal prerogative. Stunned, both because they thought that they were following the king’s wishes and because they believed in their freedom to discuss such matters, members of the Commons prepared the Protestation of 1621, exculpating their conduct and setting forth a statement of the liberties of the house. James sent for the Commons journal and personally ripped the protestation from it. He reiterated his claim that royal marriages and foreign policy were beyond the ken of Parliament and dryly noted that less than one-third of the elected members of the house had been present when the protestation was passed.</p>

                  The Parliament of 1621 was a failure at all levels.

                  Their gambit created as much consternation in England as it did in Spain. James wept inconsolably, believing that his son would be killed or imprisoned. The Spaniards saw the end of their purposely drawn-out negotiations. Every effort was made to keep Charles away from the infanta, and he only managed to catch two fleeting glimpses of the heavily veiled princess.

A series of bad grain harvests, continued dislocation of the cloth trade, and a virulent plague that killed tens of thousands all conspired against the new king.

All his predecessors had collected “forced loans” at times of imminent crisis when there was no time to await parliamentary elections, returns, and the vote of subsidies.

The £260,000 Charles collected in 1627 was precisely the sum he had turned down when it was made conditional upon his surrender of Buckingham to the wrath of the Commons. But he collected it at a heavy price: Charles was compelled to lock up 180 refusers, including many prominent gentry. However, he refused to show cause for his imprisonment of five leading knights, controversially relying on a rarely used discretionary power to arrest “by special commandment” those suspected of crimes it was not in the general interest to make public—a contingency normally used to nip conspiracies in the bud. The inevitable result was furor in the next Parliament, to which he again had to go cap in hand because he was desperate for money to fund simultaneous naval wars against the two superpowers, France and Spain.

                  The defeats of 1627 made emergency taxation more necessary than ever, and the new Parliament, 27 of whose members had been imprisoned for refusing to contribute to the loan, assembled with a sense of profound disquiet.

The petition asserted four liberties: freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom from nonparliamentary taxation, freedom from the billeting of troops, and freedom from martial law. Couched in the language of tradition, it was presented to the king as a restatement of ancient liberties. In this spirit he accepted it, more in hope of receiving his subsidies than in fear that the petition would restrain his actions.

                  Between the two sessions of this Parliament, the duke of Buckingham was assassinated (Aug. 23, 1628). While the king wept in his palace, people drank to the health of the assassin in the streets; Buckingham had become a symbol of all that was wrong in the country. But with the king’s favourite removed, there was a void in government. Buckingham had been in charge of military and domestic policy, and there was no one else who had the confidence of the king or the ability to direct the royal program. When Charles I, grief-stricken, attempted to manage the second session of Parliament by himself, all the tensions came to a head. In the Commons some members wanted to challenge violations of the Petition of Right, especially the continued collection of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary authority. Others were equally agitated about changes in religious policy caused by the emergence of <xref refid="1842205"

But before he could do so, two hotheaded members physically restrained the speaker while the Three Resolutions (1629), condemning the collection of tonnage and poundage as well as the doctrine and practice of Arminianism, were introduced. Parliament broke up in pandemonium, with both king and members shocked by the “carriage of diverse fiery spirits.”

                <p>The dissolution of the Parliament of 1628 in 1629 and the king’s clear intention to govern for a period without this troublesome institution necessitated a reversal of policy. Over the next two years, peace treaties ended England’s fruitless involvement in continental warfare in which more than £2 million had been wasted and royal government brought into disrepute. The king was also able to pacify his subjects by launching a campaign of administrative and fiscal reform that finally allowed the crown to live within its own revenues. Customs increased to £500,000 as both European and North American trade expanded. Under capable ministers such as Richard Weston, earl of Portland, prerogative income also increased. Ancient precedents were carefully searched to ensure that the crown received its full and lawful dues. Fines were imposed on those who had not come forward to be knighted at the king’s accession. These distraints of knighthood yielded more than £170,000. The boundaries of royal forests were resurveyed and encroachers fined. Fees in the court of wards were raised and procedures streamlined. With effort and application annual royal revenue reached £1 million.</p>

                  The most important of Charles’s fiscal schemes was not technically a design to squeeze monies into the royal coffers.

                        tocid="">William Laud</xref>, one of the ablest of the Arminians, became archbishop of Canterbury. Laud stressed ceremony over preaching. He believed in the “beauty of holiness” and introduced measures to decorate churches and to separate the communion table from the congregation. Both of these practices were reminiscent of Roman Catholicism, and they came at a time when Protestants everywhere feared for the survival of their religion. Nor did it help that the queen openly attended mass along with some highly placed converted courtiers. Anti-popery was the single strain that had united the diverse elements of Protestant reform, and it was now a rallying cry against innovations at home rather than abominations abroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But perhaps Laud’s greatest offense was to promote the authority of the clergy in general and of the bishops in particular, against the laity. He challenged head-on the central thrust of the English Reformation: the assault on the institutional wealth and power of the church as a clerical corporation. He wanted to restore the authority of the church courts and threatened to excommunicate the king’s judges if they persisted in trying cases that belonged to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. He also tried to restore the value of tithes and prevent the misappropriation of churchyards for secular purposes. Moreover, he sought to penalize those who did not pay the (much-enhanced) levies for the refurbishment of church buildings. Menacingly, in Scotland and Ireland (as a prelude, many assumed, to actions to come in England) he tried to renegotiate by a policy of surrender the terms on which all former monastic and cathedral lands were held. In all this he appeared to act more like an aggressive papal nuncio than a compliant appointee of the royal supreme governor of the church, and Charles I’s purring complaisance in Laud’s activities was unendurable to most of his subjects.

Without consulting Parliament, the General Assembly, the Scottish bishops in conclave, or even the Scottish Privy Council, but rather by royal diktat, Laud ordered the introduction of new canons, a new ordinal, and a new prayer book based not on the English prayer book of 1559 but on the more ceremonialist and crypto-Catholic English prayer book of 1549. This was met by riot and, eventually, rebellion. Vast numbers of Scots bound themselves passively to disobey the “unlawful” religious innovations. Charles I decided to use force to compel them, and he twice sought to use troops raised by a loyal (largely Catholic) Scottish minority, troops from Ireland, and troops from England to achieve this end.</p>

The Lords were cowed by crowds of angry London citizens and apprentices and Charles by the mistaken belief that Strafford’s blood would placate his opponents. But Strafford’s execution in May was just the beginning.

                  In fact, parliamentary reform took two different tacks. The first was to limit the king’s constitutional authority in order to protect the existence of Parliament and the liberties of subjects. The second was to reconstitute the church. In February the Triennial Act (1641) was passed, mandating the summoning of Parliament every three years. In May the king’s power to dissolve the Long Parliament was removed. Charles was forced to accept both bills. Meanwhile, the Commons relentlessly investigated the legal basis of the king’s fiscal expedients, amending the laws that Charles had so scrupulously followed. Ship money and distraints of knighthood were declared illegal, royal forests were defined, and the <xref refid="0"

                  Church reform proved more treacherous. Parliamentary leaders agreed that Charles and Laud had introduced intolerable innovations, but where some were satisfied by their removal, others wished that they be replaced by even greater novelties.

Pym and his supporters were as yet unwilling to propose such a sweeping change, fearing lest it divide the Commons and create a crisis with the Lords. Nevertheless, the equally radical proposal to remove the bishops from the upper house was passed in May, and, when the Lords rejected it, the Commons responded with the Root and Branch Bill.

                <p>
                  Pym’s fear that the religious issue might break apart the parliamentary consensus was compounded by his fear of provoking the king to counterattack. Throughout the first six months of the session, Charles had meekly followed Parliament’s lead. But there were ominous signs that the worm would turn. His leading advisers, the queen among them, were searching for military options. The radical attack upon the church allowed the king to portray himself as the conservator of “the pure religion of <xref refid="0"

Week by week, sympathy for the king was growing, and in August Charles determined to conclude a peace treaty with the Scots. This successful negotiation removed the crisis that had brought the Long Parliament into being. When Charles returned to London at the end of November, he was met by cheering crowds and a large body of members of the two houses, who were unaware that he had been behind a failed attempt to arrest the leading conservator and overturn the Scottish settlement.

                  While the king resolved one crisis in Scotland, another emerged in Ireland. Catholics, stung by the harsh repression of Strafford’s rule and by the threat of plantation and of the direct rule from England planned by the Long Parliament, rose against their Protestant overlords and slaughtered thousands in a bloody rebellion. Though the reality was grim enough, the exaggerated reports that reached London seemed to fulfill the worst fears of a popish plot.

                <p>The passage of the Grand Remonstrance was followed by Pym’s attempt to transfer control of the militia (the appointment of lords, lieutenants, military officers, etc.) from the crown to Parliament. The political situation had reached a state of crisis. In Parliament, rumours spread of a royal attack upon the houses, and at court wild talk of an impeachment of the queen was reported. It was Charles who broke the deadlock. On Jan. 4, 1642, he rode to Westminster intending to impeach five members of the Commons and one of the Lords on charges of treason. It was the same device that had already failed in Scotland. But, because the king’s plan was no secret, the members had already fled. Thus, Charles’s dramatic breach of parliamentary privilege badly backfired. He not only failed to obtain his objective but also lost the confidence of many of the moderates left in Parliament. After ensuring the safe departure of his wife and children out of the country, Charles abandoned his capital and headed north.</p>
                <p>The initiative had returned to Pym and his allies, who now proceeded to pass much of their stalled legislation, including the exclusion of the bishops from the Lords and the Impressment Bill (1642), which allowed Parliament to raise the army for Ireland. In June a series of proposals for a treaty, the Nineteen Propositions (1642), was presented to the king. The proposals called for parliamentary control over the militia, the choice of royal counselors, and religious reform. Charles rejected them outright, though in his answer he seemed to grant Parliament a coordinate power in government, making the king but one of the three estates. The king, however, had determined to settle the matter by main force. His principal advisers believed that the greatest lords and gentlemen would rally to their king and that Parliament would not have the stomach for rebellion. On Aug. 22, 1642, the king raised his standard bearing the device “Give Caesar His Due.”</p>

                  The war that began in 1642 was a war within three kingdoms and between three kingdoms. There was a civil war in Ireland that pitted the Catholic majority against the Protestant minority, buttressed by English and Scottish armies. This war festered nastily throughout the 1640s and was settled only by a devastating use of force and terror by<xref refid="1842218"

Whenever they were in the ascendancy, the Catholic Irish were willing to send armies into England to assist Charles I, on condition that he give them religious freedom and effective control of the political institutions of the Irish kingdom. After the Cromwellian conquest, the English set out to destroy the power and wealth of the Catholic elite—at one point even proposing to transport every native Catholic from 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland into the western region comprising the 5 counties of Connacht and County Clare; in the event, they settled for a confiscation of two-fifths of the land and its redistribution to Protestant Englishmen.
                </p>
                <p>Scotland also was embroiled in civil war, but, at one time or another, all the groups involved demonstrated a willingness to send armies into England. The Anglo-Scottish wars were fought from 1643 to 1646, resumed from 1648 to 1651, and resulted in an English military occupation and complete political subjugation (the incorporation of Scotland into an enhanced English state) that lasted until the Restoration in 1660.</p>
                <p>
                  And then there was the English Civil War that began in 1642, a war that neither king, Parliament, nor the country wanted. It was a war that was as dangerous to win as to lose. The parliamentarians could only maintain the fiction that they were fighting to “preserve the safety of the king,” as the commission of their commander, <xref refid="1842222"

                  The first years of war were as halfhearted as these justifications. Parliament held the tactical advantages of controlling the navy and London. While the navy protected the coast from foreign invasion, London provided the funds and manpower for battle. The king held the strategic advantage of knowing that he had to recapture his capital. He relied upon the aristocracy for men and arms. In the first substantial engagement of the war, the <xref refid="1842224"

At Brentford (1642), on the outskirts of London, the City militia narrowly averted the king’s triumph. For the next two years, however, the war was fought to a desultory standstill.
                </p>
                <p>Almost from the beginning, the members of Parliament were divided over their goals. A war group argued that Charles could not be trusted until he learned the lesson of military defeat. A peace group countered that the longer the war ground on, the less likely Charles would be to compromise. Both of these groups were loose coalitions, and neither of them dominated parliamentary politics. Until his death in 1643, Pym steered a course between them, supporting the Oxford Propositions (1643) for peace as well as creating the administrative machinery to raise and finance armies. The excise, modeled on impositions, and the monthly assessments, modeled on ship money, increased levels of taxation to new heights. The king burdened the communities his forces controlled just as heavily.</p>

In January 1647 Charles was returned to English custody, and Holles moved forward with his plan to send a portion of the army to Ireland, assign a small force to English garrisons, and disband the rest. But in this he reckoned without the army. In the rank and file, concern about arrears of pay, indemnity, and liability for impressment stirred the soldiers to resist Irish service. A movement that began over material grievances soon turned political as representatives were chosen from the rank and file to present demands through their officers to Parliament. Holles attempted to brush this movement aside and push through his disbandment scheme. At this the army rose up, driving out those of its officers who supported the disbandment, seizing Charles at Holmby House on June 3 and demanding the impeachment of Holles and his main supporters. At the beginning of August 1647, the army marched into London, and Holles, with 10 of his allies, fled the capital.</p>

The king was directly blamed for the unnecessary loss of life, and for the first time alternatives to Charles Stuart, “that man of blood,” were openly contemplated. Parliament too was appalled by the renewal of fighting. Moderate members believed that there was still a chance to bring the king to terms, despite the fact that he had rejected treaty after treaty.

                  Victorious wars against the Irish, Scots, and Dutch (1652) made the Commonwealth a feared military power. But the struggle for survival defined the Rump’s conservative policies. Little was done to reform the law. An attempt to abolish the court of chancery created chaos in the central courts. Little agreement could be reached on religious matters, especially on the vexing question of the compulsory payment of tithes. The Rump failed both to make long-term provision for a new “national church” and to define the state’s right to confer and place limits on the freedom of those who wished to worship and gather outside the church. Most ominously, nothing at all had been done to set a limit for the sitting of the Rump and to provide for franchise reform and the election of a new Parliament. This had been the principal demand of the army, and the more the Rump protested the difficulty of the problem, the less patient the soldiers became. In April, when it was clear that the Rump would set a limit to its sitting but would nominate its own members to judge new elections, Cromwell marched to Westminster and dissolved Parliament. The Rump was replaced by an assembly nominated mostly by the army high command. The <xref refid="0"

                <p>But the protector was no better able to manage his Parliaments than had been the king. The Parliament of 1654 immediately questioned the entire basis of the newly established government, with the republicans vigorously disputing the office of lord protector. The Parliament of 1656, despite the exclusion of many known opponents, was no more pliable. Both were a focus for the manifold discontents of supporters and opponents of the regime.</p>
                <p>Nothing was more central to the Cromwellian experiment than the cause of religious liberty. Cromwell believed that no one church had a monopoly on truth and that no one form of government or worship was necessary or desirable. Moreover, he believed in a loosely federated national church, with each parish free to worship as it wished within very broad limits and staffed by a clergy licensed by the state on the basis of their knowledge of the Bible and the uprightness of their lives, without reference to their religious beliefs. On the other hand, Cromwell felt that there should be freedom for “all species of protestant” to gather if they wished into religious assemblies outside the national church. He did not believe, however, that religious liberty was a natural right, but one conferred by the Christian magistrate, who could place prudential limits on the exercise of that liberty. Thus, those who claimed that their religion permitted or even promoted licentiousness and sexual freedom, who denied the Trinity, or who claimed the right to disrupt the worship of others were subject to proscription or penalty. Furthermore, for the only time between the Reformation and the mid-19th century, there was no religious test for the holding of public office. Although Cromwell made his detestation of Catholicism very plain, Catholics benefited from the repeal of the laws requiring attendance at parish churches, and they were less persecuted for the private exercise of their own faith than at any other time in the century. Cromwell’s policy of religious tolerance was far from total, but it was exceptional in the early modern world.</p>

                  Among opponents, royalists were again active, though by now they were reduced to secret associations and conspiracies. In the west, Penruddock’s rising, the most successful of a series of otherwise feeble royalist actions in March 1655, was effectively suppressed, but Cromwell reacted by reducing both the standing army and the level of taxation on all. He also appointed senior army officers “major generals,” raising ultra-loyal militias from among the demobbed veterans paid for by penal taxation on all those convicted of active royalism in the previous decade. The major generals were also charged with superintending “a reformation of manners”—the imposition of strict <xref refid="1842322"

                  By now it was apparent that the regime was held together by Cromwell alone. Within his personality resided the contradictions of the revolution. Like the gentry, he desired a fixed and stable constitution, but, like the zealous, he was infused with a millenarian vision of a more glorious world to come (<e>see</e><xref refid="1842325"

As a member of Parliament from 1640, he respected the fundamental authority that Parliament represented, but, as a member of the army, he understood power and the decisive demands of necessity. In the 1650s many wished him to become king, but he refused the crown, preferring the authority of the people to the authority of the sword. When he died in 1658, all hope of continued reform died with him.

A month later the Long Parliament dissolved itself, paving the way for the return of the king.

Despite Charles’s desire to treat his father’s adversaries leniently and to find a broad church settlement, the Cavalier Parliament sought to establish a rigid Anglican orthodoxy. It began the alliance between squire and parson that was to dominate English local society for centuries. The bishops were returned to Parliament, a new prayer book was authorized, and repressive acts were passed to compel conformity. The imposition of oaths of allegiance and nonresistance to the crown and an oath recognizing the king’s supremacy in the church upon all members of local government in the Corporation Act (1661) and then upon the clergy in the Act of Uniformity (1662) led to a massive purge of officeholders. Town governors were put out of their places, and nearly one-fifth of all clergymen were deprived of their livings. Authority in the localities was now firmly in the hands of the gentry.

                <p>By now the king was set upon a collision course with his natural supporters. The Tory interest was made up of solid support for church and king; it was James’s mistake to believe that they would support one without the other. In 1687 he reissued the Declaration of Indulgence, which suspended the penal laws against Catholics and Dissenters. This was a temporary measure, for James hoped that his next Parliament would repeal the penal code in its entirety. To that end he began a systematic investigation of the parliamentary boroughs. Agents were sent to question mayors, lieutenants, and justices of the peace about their loyalty to the regime and their willingness to vote for members of Parliament (MPs) who would repeal the Test Acts. Most gave temporizing answers, but those who stood out were purged from their places. For the first time in English history, the crown was undertaking to pack Parliament.</p>

                  The final crisis of James’s reign resulted from two related events. The first was the refusal of seven bishops to instruct the clergy of their dioceses to read the Declaration of Indulgence in their churches. The king was so infuriated by this unexpected check to his plans that he had the bishops imprisoned, charged with seditious libel, and tried. Meanwhile, in June 1688 Queen Mary (<xref refid="1841673"

                  </thumbasm>This came as no surprise to William, who had been contemplating an invasion since the spring of 1688. William, who was organizing the Grand Alliance against Louis XIV, needed England as an ally rather than a rival. All Europe was readying for war in the summer of 1688, and James had powerful land and sea forces at his disposal to repel William’s invasion. The crossing, begun on October 19, was a feat of military genius, however propitious the strong eastern “Protestant wind” that kept the English fleet at anchor while Dutch ships landed at <xref refid="1841675"

                </p>
                <p>Yet there was no plan to depose the king. Many Tories hoped that William’s presence would force James to change his policies; many Whigs believed that a free Parliament could fetter his excesses. When James marched out of London, there was even the prospect of battle. But the result was completely unforeseen. James lost his nerve, sent his family to France, and followed after them, tossing the Great Seal into the Thames. James’s flight was a godsend, and, when he was captured en route, William allowed him to escape again. At the end of December, William arrived in London, summoned the leading peers and bishops to help him keep order, and called Parliament into being.</p>
                <p>
                  The Convention Parliament (1689) met amid the confusion created by James’s flight. For some Tories, James II was still the king. Some were willing to contemplate a regency and others to allow Mary to rule with William as consort. But neither William nor the Whigs would accept such a solution. William was to be king in his own right, and in February the Convention agreed that James had “abdicated the government and that the throne has thereby become vacant.” At the same time, the leaders of the Convention prepared the Declaration of Rights to be presented to William and Mary. The declaration was a restatement of traditional rights, but the conflicts between Whigs and Tories caused it to be watered down considerably. Nevertheless, the Whigs did manage to declare the suspending power and the maintenance of a standing army in peacetime illegal. But many of the other clauses protecting <xref refid="0"

The Toleration Act permitted most forms of Protestant worship; Unitarians were explicitly excluded, as were Catholics and Jews. But the Test Acts that prevented Dissenters from holding government office or sitting in Parliament were continued in force.

                  William III had come to England to further his continental designs, but English politics conspired against him. The first years of his reign were dominated by the constitutional issues of the revolution settlement, and he became increasingly frustrated with the political squabbling of Whigs and Tories. Moreover, holding the English throne was proving more difficult than taking it. In 1690, with French backing, James II invaded Ireland. William personally led an army to the <xref refid="1841768"

This led to both economies and accountability, and it forged a new political alliance among “country” (that is, anti-court) forces that were uneasy about foreign entanglements and suspicious of corruption at court. William’s war was going badly on land and sea. The French fleet inflicted heavy losses on a combined Anglo-Dutch force and heavier losses on English merchant shipping. The land war was a desultory series of sieges and reliefs, which again tipped in favour of France.

                  For some time it looked as if Scotland might go its own way. Whereas in England the centre held and compromises were reached, in Scotland James’s supporters first held their ground and then crumbled, and a vindictive Parliament not only decreed a proscription of his supporters but set out to place much greater limits on the crown. James was formally deposed. Moreover, measures were taken to ensure that Westminster could not dictate what was done in Edinburgh. And there was to be religious toleration in Scotland. <xref refid="1841785"

It lent to the government at a fixed rate of interest—initially 8 percent—and this interest was secured by a specific customs grant. Investors scrambled for the bank’s notes, which were considered gilt-edged securities, and more than £1.2 million was raised on the initial offering. Not surprisingly, a growing funded debt created inflation and led to a financial crisis in 1696. But the underlying English economy was sound, and military expenditures fueled production.
                </p>
                <p>The establishment of a funded national debt and the Bank of England was the work of the Whigs in alliance with the London mercantile establishment. The Tories and the country party were alternately suspicious and jealous of Whig success. In order to secure funds for his campaigns, William had been forced to allow the Whigs to dominate government, much against his inclination. An attempted assassination of the king in 1696 gave the Whigs an opportunity to impose an oath on the political nation that William was the “rightful and lawful king.” This directly challenged Tory consciences, which had been tender since the death of Queen Mary in 1694. Many resigned office rather than affirm what they did not believe. The ascendancy of the so-called Junto Whigs might have been secured had not European events once again intruded into English affairs. In 1697 the War of the Grand Alliance ended with the Treaty of Rijswijk, in which Louis XIV formally recognized William III as king of England.</p>

                  The most significant development in political life over the previous quarter century had been the growth of clearly defined and opposing parties, which had taken the opprobrious titles Whigs and Tories. Parties had first formed during the exclusion crisis of 1679–81, but it was the Triennial Act (1694) that unintentionally gave life to party conflict. Nine general elections were held between 1695 and 1713, and these provided the structure whereby party issues and party leaders were pushed to the fore. Though party discipline was still in its infancy and ideology was a novel aspect of politics, clearly recognizable political parties had emerged by the end of the reign of William III. In general, the Tories stood for the Anglican church, the land, and the principle of passive obedience. They remained divided over the impending Hanoverian succession (<e>see</e> <xref refid="1842375"

Here again, Godolphin was the dominant figure, calling the Scottish Parliament’s bluff when it announced it would not accept the Hanoverian succession. Godolphin passed the Aliens Act (1705), which would have prohibited all trade between England and Scotland—no mere scare tactic in light of the commercial policy that was crippling the Irish economy. Rather than risk economic strangulation, Scottish leaders negotiated for a permanent union, a compact the English monarchy had sought for more than a century. The union was a well-balanced bargain: free trade was established; Scottish Presbyterianism and the Scottish legal system were protected; and provisions were made to include 45 Scottish members in the English House of Commons and 18 members in the House of Lords. England gained security on its northern border, and the Whigs gained the promise of a peaceful Hanoverian succession.

A brilliant politician, he realized that the Tories would have little to hope for from the Hanoverians and that they could only survive by creating huge majorities in Parliament and an unshakable alliance with the church.

                Britain’s ability to pay for war on this scale demonstrated the extent of its wealth. Agriculture was still the bedrock of the economy, but trade was increasing, and more men and women were employed in industry in Britain than in any other European nation. Wealth, however, was unequally distributed, with almost a third of the national income belonging to only 5 percent of the population. But British society was not polarized simply between the rich and the poor; according to writer <xref refid="1609869"

              <p>From 1700 to the 1740s Britain’s population remained stable at about seven million, and agricultural production increased. So, although men and women from Defoe’s 6th and 7th categories could still die of hunger and hunger-related diseases, in most regions of Britain there was usually enough basic food to go around. This was crucial to social stability and to popular acquiescence in the new Hanoverian regime.</p>

They were more anxious to preserve the privileges of the Anglican church and more hostile to military involvement in continental Europe than Whig politicians were inclined to be.

As a German he was deeply interested in European affairs. Consequently he regarded the Tory party as insular in its outlook as well as suspect in its allegiance.

It allowed general elections to occur at seven-year intervals instead of every three years, as mandated by the Triennial Act of 1694. The intention was to tame the electorate, which during Anne’s reign had shown itself to be volatile and far more inclined to vote Tory than Whig.

He showed his power by mobilizing a majority of MPs against the Peerage Bill in 1719. Had this legislation passed, it would have limited the king’s prerogative to create new peers, thereby cementing the Whig administration’s majority in the House of Lords. To prevent further blows of this kind, the Whig elite ended its schism in April 1720. The royal family temporarily buried its differences at the same time.

Many landed and mercantile families were ruined, and there was a nationwide shortage of specie. Parliament demanded an inquiry, thus raising the possibility that members of the government and the royal family would be openly implicated in financial scandal. This disaster proved to be Walpole’s opportunity, and he did not waste it. He used his influence in the Commons to blunt the parliamentary inquiry and managed gradually to restore financial confidence. The strain of the investigation killed Stanhope, and Sunderland too died in 1722. Walpole duly became first lord of the treasury and chancellor of exchequer, while Townshend returned to his post as secretary of state.

Some were motivated primarily by disappointed ambition. But many Whigs and Tories genuinely believed that Walpole had arrogated too much power to himself and that he was corrupt and an enemy to liberty.

Royal favour, in turn, shored up Walpole’s parliamentary majority. Because the monarch appointed and promoted peers, he had massive influence in the House of Lords. In addition, he appointed the 26 bishops of the Church of England, who also possessed seats in the House of Lords. He alone could promote men to high office in the army, navy, diplomatic service, and bureaucracy. Consequently, MPs who held such offices (the so-called placemen), and those who wanted to hold them in the future, were likely to support Walpole as the king’s minister out of self-interest, if for no other reason. Walpole, however, could never take royal support for granted. George II was an irritable but by no means an insignificant figure who retained great influence in terms of patronage, military affairs, and foreign policy. He demanded respect from his minister and had to be carefully managed.

By keeping out of European entanglements for so long, Walpole appeased some of the traditionally insular Tory MPs. He also kept direct taxation low, which pleased many landed families. The land tax was cut to two shillings in the pound (10 percent) in 1730 and to one shilling in the pound two years later.

There were 5,000 parishes in these two countries, each containing at least one church served by a vicar (minister) or a curate (his deputy). For much of the 18th century these Anglican churches provided the only large, covered meeting places available outside of towns. They served as sources of spiritual comfort and also as centres for village social life. At religious services vicars would not only preach the word of God but also explain to congregations important national developments: wars, victories, and royal deaths and births. Thus churches often supplied the poor, the illiterate, and particularly women with the only political information available to them. Weakening the Church of England therefore struck Walpole as unwise, for at least two reasons. Its ministers provided a vital service to the state by communicating political instruction to the people. The church, moreover, commanded massive popular loyalty, and assaults on its position would arouse nationwide discontent. Walpole therefore determined to reach an accommodation with the church, and in 1723 he came to an agreement with Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London. Gibson was to ensure that only clergymen sympathetic to the Whig administration were appointed to influential positions in the Church of England. In return, Walpole undertook that no further extensive concessions would be made to Protestant dissenters. This arrangement continued until 1736.

He succeeded in reducing interest payments on the debt by 26 percent during his time in office, but his efforts to reduce the land tax in favour of more excises almost led to political disaster. In 1732 he revived a duty on salt, which enabled him to cut the land tax to one shilling in the pound. In 1733 he proposed to levy excise taxes on the sale of wine and tobacco, but the Opposition in Parliament launched a ferocious and successful campaign against these proposals. It claimed that excises weighed unfairly on the poor, whereas the land tax was mainly paid by the prosperous. It claimed, too, that excise collectors, and there were more than 6,000 of them employed by the state by this time, intruded into citizens’ private affairs and were a danger to British liberties. This crisis led to nationwide riots and demonstrations, and Walpole’s House-of-Commons majority seemed in jeopardy. In April 1733 he decided to retreat. He continued, however, until 1740 to keep the land tax at a low rate, thereby winning important support from the nation’s dominant landed class.

And some of Walpole’s policies were now widely viewed as dubious, even anachronistic. Whereas he wanted to keep Britain out of war, many government and Opposition MPs, and even some members of Walpole’s own Cabinet, favoured going to war with Spain to gain colonial and commercial objectives.

His political doom was sealed in the fall of that year when the Tory and Whig sectors of the Opposition managed finally to agree on a strategy to defeat him. Walpole eventually resigned from his offices in early 1742. He still retained the king’s favour, and, although sections of the Opposition wanted to impeach him for corruption, he was given a peerage, entered the House of Lords as earl of Orford, and died in his bed in 1745. Nonetheless, the fact that he had to resign despite George II’s continuing support indicated an important development in the British political system. Although monarchs retained the rights to choose their own ministers, they could no longer retain a chief minister who was unable to command a majority of votes in the House of Commons. If they wanted to remain in office, chief ministers now needed to possess parliamentary as well as royal support.

                Political events after Walpole’s resignation demonstrated once again the artificiality and inner tensions of the Opposition. Its Tory sector (some 140 MPs strong) had expected that a new administration would be formed in which some of their leaders would be given state office. They hoped that the proscription of their party, implemented after 1714, would be reversed and that various changes in domestic and foreign policy would be made. But now that Walpole was out of the picture many of their Patriot Whig allies wanted nothing more to do with Tories or Tory measures.

In June George commanded his British and Hanoverian troops at the Battle of Dettingen (the last battle in which a British monarch commanded), defeating the opposing French forces. But the victory was not followed up and aroused little patriotic enthusiasm in Britain. Instead, accusations that the king and Carteret were sacrificing British interests to Hanoverian priorities were openly expressed in Parliament and in the press. The Pelham brothers took advantage of this discontent (and Carteret’s absence) to undermine his political position. In November 1744 he was forced to resign, though during the next 18 months George II continued to consult with him privately on political business. These intrigues infuriated Henry Pelham, who was now first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer, and his brother Newcastle, who was secretary of state.

Since Britain was now at odds with France, the latter power was willing to sponsor an invasion on behalf of the Stuart dynasty. It hoped that such an invasion would win support from the masses and from the Tory sector of the landed class. Although a handful of Tory conspirators encouraged these hopes, the degree of their commitment is open to question. A large-scale French naval invasion of Britain in early 1744 failed in part because these men would not commit themselves to action. In July 1745 the Old Pretender’s eldest son, <xref refid="0"

In September he and some 2,500 Scottish supporters defeated a British force of the same size at the Battle of Prestonpans. In December, with an army of 5,000 men, he marched into England and got as far south as the town of Derby, some 150 miles from London.

                <p>
                  Charles’s initial success owed much to the ineptitude, the unconcern even, of Britain’s rulers. One problem was that the standing army was too small, consisting of some 62,000 men. Because of Britain’s involvement in the War of the Austrian Succession, the bulk of this force was in Flanders and Germany. Only 4,000 men had been left to defend Scotland, and most of them were raw recruits. Moreover, hampered by internal divisions, the administration was slow to respond. When the Young Pretender landed, the Pelhams were anxious but Carteret, now earl of Granville, was not. Nor, at the beginning, was George II, who was actually in Hanover when his rival for the throne landed. As a result of these squabbles and misunderstandings, Parliament did not assemble until October 17, 1745. Because by law only Parliament could authorize money to pay the militia (Britain’s <xref refid="0"

                  Some historians have argued that the mass of Britain’s population cared little which dynasty ruled them at this time and that the Young Pretender would have regained the kingdom for the Stuarts if only he had pressed on to London. Clearly, this thesis can never be proved one way or the other. The Jacobites, however, did not try to march on to London but retreated to Scotland. Nonetheless, it is probably significant that the Young Pretender attracted scarcely any English supporters on his march to Derby. Only in <xref refid="0"

No Tory landowner or politician joined him, nor did any men of influence or wealth come out in his favour. By contrast, once the seriousness of the invasion was recognized, many individuals joined home-defense units or subscribed money against it. Between September and December 57 civilian loyal associations are known to have been founded in 38 different counties. Merchants and traders in the prosperous towns—Liverpool, Norwich, Exeter, Bristol, and most of all London—were particularly prominent in loyalist activity.

                  Although many Britons had become disillusioned by events after Walpole’s fall, probably few were seriously tempted by the prospect of a Jacobite restoration. The Young Pretender, a Roman Catholic, was viewed as the pawn of France, Britain’s enemy and prime commercial and imperial competitor. Traditionally the Catholic religion and French politics were associated with absolutist government, religious persecution, and assaults on liberty.

The administration also confiscated the estates of Highlands chieftains who had rebelled and used the proceeds to encourage trade and agriculture in Scotland. Indeed, the gradual pacification of Scotland and its partial integration into a united Britain probably owed more to growing prosperity than to legal changes.

Frederick’s avowed commitment to a nonparty government attracted Tory as well as a few Whig MPs to his support in the late 1740s. But their schemes and hopes were dashed when Frederick died in 1751. His eldest son, George (the future George III), became heir to the throne, and serious opposition to Pelham effectively ceased. Debate in Parliament became so muted, one politician wrote, that a bird might have built its nest in the Speaker’s wig and never be disturbed.

Together with the greater gentry and the squires, listed in Massie’s second and third categories, great landowners such as these owned considerably more than half of the cultivatable land in Britain.

Some of these self-made families purchased landed estates to advertise their new wealth; others made do with smart town houses or country villas. But, although it was possible to be rich and influential in this society without owning broad acres, it was the landed elite that set the cultural tone and dominated positions of power in both central and local government. Every peer in the House of Lords and a majority of MPs in the House of Commons owned land. Landowners also monopolized the office of lord lieutenant. Lords lieutenant were the crown’s leading representatives in each of the English and Welsh counties. (Only in the 1790s was this office extended to Scotland.) Appointed by the king, they were responsible for maintaining law and order in their counties and for organizing civil defense measures during time of war. To assist them in these tasks, they appointed deputy lieutenants and justices of the peace—offices usually held by the squires and lesser gentry in the countryside and by merchants and landed gentlemen in the towns. None of these offices carried salaries—a clear indication that they were confined to the prosperous. But they brought with them considerable local influence and status and were often much sought after.

Some of these great European capitals had no resident sovereign. Many others, such as Vienna and St. Petersburg, were grand ceremonial and cultural centres but effectively isolated from the economic life of their national hinterland. London was different. It was not only the location of the Court and of Parliament but also the nation’s chief port, its financial centre, the home of its printing industry, and the hub of its communications network. Britain’s rulers were brought into constant proximity with powerful economic lobbies from all parts of the nation and with a large and constantly fluctuating portion of their subjects. Britons seem to have been more mobile than their fellow Europeans in this period, and then as now many traveled to the capital to find work and excitement. Perhaps as many as one in six Britons spent a portion of their working life in London in the 18th century.

                  London easily dwarfed the other British towns. In 1750 its nearest rival, Norwich, had fewer than 50,000 people. Nonetheless, the provincial towns, although functioning on quite a different scale from that of the metropolis, were also growing in size and importance at this time. In 1700 only 10 of them contained more than 10,000 people. By 1750 there were 17 towns with populations of that size, and by 1800 there were more than 50. As towns grew, they became better organized and safer, more pleasant places to live in. Because more stone was used in buildings, the risk of destruction by fire began to lessen. Towns acquired insurance companies and fire engines to protect their citizens. Supplies of clean water improved. Urban planning and architecture became more sophisticated and splendid, and the results can still be seen today in towns like Stamford in Lincolnshire or <xref refid="0"

By mid-century there were at least nine coffeehouses in Bristol, six in both Liverpool and Chester, two in Northampton, and at least one in most substantial market towns. Such establishments supplied their customers with newspapers and a place to gossip as well as with liquid refreshments. They also often served as a base for clubs, debating societies, and spontaneous political activity. Schools grew in number, in both the towns and the surrounding countryside.

                  Yet it would be wrong to postulate too stark a contrast in life-styles between the town and countryside, between the wealthy and the lower orders. Points of contact between the various layers of British society were in fact increasing at this time. More and more country landowners, their womenfolk, and their servants succumbed (without, one suspects, too much trouble) to the temptation of spending some months every year sampling the pleasures of their neighbourhood provincial town, consulting its lawyers and financial agents, and patronizing its shops. Many urban merchants, taking advantage of better roads and coach services, went to live in the countryside while maintaining their businesses in town. Lower down the social scale, hawkers and peddlers (itinerant traders) carried town-produced goods into the country areas and sold them there. Conversely, the growing demand for food in urban areas sucked in men and goods from the countryside. English drovers braved the old Roman roads and faltering bridle paths, the only routes available in Welsh counties such as Caernarvon and Anglesey, in order to purchase meat cattle for London and other towns. Every year tens of thousands of black cattle from the Scottish Highlands were driven southward until they reached the Smithfield meat market in London. Demand for manufactured goods fostered the spread of inland trade, as did increasing industrial specialization in the different British regions. <xref refid="0"

                  By 1760 more than nine million newspapers were sold in Britain every year. Because they were expensive by the standards of the time (three or four pennies), one copy of a paper may have been shared and read by as many as 20 different people. There is little doubt that this explosion of newsprint helped to integrate the nation. All provincial newspapers and periodicals were parasitic on the London press. They borrowed large extracts from the more popular and controversial London papers and pamphlets. Increasingly, too, they broke the law and reprinted London journalists’ accounts of debates in the House of Commons and House of Lords (printing parliamentary debates was illegal until 1770).

Pitt captured the attention and imagination of Parliament and of the people by his rhetoric and charisma; Newcastle employed his experience and industry to raise more than £160 million during the course of the war. But what cemented the coalition was Britain’s naval and military successes. In India, where Britain and France were keen competitors, General <xref refid="1531113"

                  The American issue was the final and most volatile element in the instability of the 1760s. Tension mounted, as far as British governments were concerned, primarily for two reasons. First, from this decade onward imperial organization received increased attention, and attempts were made to tighten British rule in Ireland and India as well as in the American colonies, a development that caused friction. Fiscal need was the second and more pressing problem. In 1763 the national debt stood at £114 million, and it continued to grow. Since the burden of taxation was already heavy for Britons, the government naturally looked to other sources of revenue. This was the background to George Grenville’s decision, in 1765, to pass the <xref refid="0"

The so-called 19th-century British Whig historians also criticized the king in very harsh terms, maintaining, at their most extreme, that as a young prince he was indoctrinated with archaic and inflated ideas of royal power. When he came to the throne, he supposedly ousted his Whig ministers, replacing them with Tories, who were more sympathetic to royal ambitions. His arbitrary aims and policies, it was claimed, provoked the Wilkite agitation in Britain and drove the American colonists to rebel.

It has now been established that the king was neither educated in arbitrary ideas, nor did he preside over a Tory revival. Ministers such as Bute, Grenville, Townshend, and North regarded themselves as Whigs. But by the 1760s and ’70s “Whig” and “Tory” were terms that had lost precise ideological significance, and the breakdown of these old partisan divisions undoubtedly contributed to ministerial instability at this time. There is little evidence that the king used corrupt influence to make Parliament accept his American policy. Indeed, it is unlikely that he initially even possessed an American policy; royal correspondence shows that he was rarely closely interested in American affairs before 1774. The colonists’ drift toward opposition and independence was probably caused as much by their distance from London and their increasing prosperity as it was by British fiscal measures.

                <p>But George III cannot be entirely exonerated. When he succeeded, he was only 22, immature, idealistic, and not well-educated. His appointment of his decorative favourite, Lord Bute, was a breach of the convention that monarchs should choose chief ministers possessed of political experience and proven abilities. In his dealings with other politicians George showed himself throughout his reign to be intransigent and obstinate, and he often confused his own personal feelings with the public welfare. He can scarcely be blamed for wanting to retain such an important part of his empire as the American colonies, but he can legitimately be criticized for insisting that the American war be continued after 1780, by which time it had become clear to his chief minister, Lord North, that Britain had lost.</p>

                  The next two years proved profoundly difficult. Fears that the French would invade Ireland as a prelude to invading the British mainland led ministers to encourage the creation of an Irish volunteer force some 40,000 strong. The Irish Protestant elite, led by <xref refid="0"

In 1783 Ireland was granted legislative independence, though it remained subject to George III. Declining British fortunes abroad also revived the issue of parliamentary reform. By 1779 three different reform groups had emerged, all of whom favoured peace with America. The marquess of Rockingham and his parliamentary supporters (including his secretary, Edmund Burke) wanted to reduce official corruption and George III’s influence in government. Another group, led by Christopher Wyvill, a one-time Anglican clergyman, wanted a moderate reform of the representative system. Wyvill and some of his supporters played with the idea of a national association, an assembly of reformers from each county in Britain, that would exist parallel to Parliament and be superior to it in constitutional zeal.

                  It was unlikely that any of these reforms would be implemented. But the Gordon Riots of June 1780 made it certain that they would not be.

To many, the very name of Wyvill’s National Association was dangerously suggestive of the Protestant Association, and the parliamentary reform movement lapsed until the 1790s.

              <p>Defeat abroad and division at home led many Britons to believe that their country was in irreversible decline. The war had cost more than £236.4 million and had apparently brought only humiliation and the loss of one of the most profitable regions of the British Empire. Yet recovery was rapid, and by the time Britain again went to war—in 1793, against revolutionary France—it was wealthier and more powerful than it had been at the beginning of George III’s reign.</p>

The Fox–North coalition planned to cement its authority by passing a bill to reform the government of British settlements in India, previously administered by the East India Company alone. The India Bill passed the Commons but, like every other piece of legislation not directly concerned with taxation, it had to be approved by a majority in the House of Lords. In advance of the vote the king let it be known that he would regard any peer who supported the bill with disfavour. The Lords duly threw the bill out in December 1783, providing the king with an excuse to dismiss Fox and North and replace them with William Pitt the Younger, the second son of the late earl of Chatham. The general election of 1784 supplied Pitt with a parliamentary majority.

                  Pitt lived and died a bachelor, totally obsessed with political office. He was clever, single-minded, confident of his own abilities, and a natural politician. But perhaps his greatest asset in the early 1780s was his youth. He had entered Parliament in 1780 and was just 24 when he became first minister in 1783. Consequently, he was not associated in the public mind with the American debacle but seemed instead to promise a new era. Moreover, although he and George III never developed a close relationship, he did enjoy the king’s support. Knowing that the alternative to Pitt was Fox (whom he hated), the king dealt with Pitt in a responsible manner. In 1788–89 the king suffered a major bout of insanity (or, according to some scholars, porphyria, a hereditary <xref refid="0"

He dropped his early enthusiasm for parliamentary reform, and in 1801 he resigned over the issue of Roman Catholic emancipation (the extension of civil rights to Catholics) rather than force the king to accept it.

                  Many of Pitt’s reforms and policies, such as his India Act, had been devised by previous ministers. But even though he did not originate all of his schemes, Pitt nonetheless deserves credit for actually implementing them. For all his priggish ruthlessness and occasional dishonesties (perhaps because of them), Pitt undoubtedly contributed to the restoration of national confidence; indeed, for many people, he became its very personification.

But, second, Britain’s economic recovery after the war was rapid and dramatic. Particularly noticeable is the fact that the wars with revolutionary and Napoleonic France (1793–1802 and 1803–15) did not slow Britain’s buoyant prosperity. Although Napoleon tried to blockade Britain in 1808 and again in 1811–12, he never succeeded in cutting the lifeline of its trade. In the period 1794–96 British exports averaged £21.7 million per annum. In the period 1804–06 the equivalent figure was £37.5 million, and during 1814–16, £44.4 million.

Large, anonymous factories did not become common until the late 19th century. Other scholars have argued, rightly, that industry did not suddenly take off in the 1780s and that even in 1700 Britain was a more industrialized state than its European competitors. But, despite all these qualifications, the available evidence suggests that by 1800 Britain was by far the most industrialized state in the world and that, because of this, its rate of economic growth must have accelerated in the last third of the 18th century.

By comparison, while a similar rate of demographic growth occurred in Ireland, there was no Irish Industrial Revolution. Partly as a result of this, Ireland suffered the great famine in the 1840s, whereas there was no similar famine in Britain.

                  Although it is not easy to account for Britain’s early industrialization, some facts stand out. Britain, unlike its prime European rival, France, was a small, compact island. Except in northern Scotland, it had no major forests or mountains to disrupt or impede its internal communications. The country possessed a range of natural ports facing the Atlantic, plenty of coastal shipping, and a good system of internal waterways. By the 1760s there were already 1,000 miles of inland canals in Britain; over the next 70 years 3,000 more miles of canals were constructed. Britain was also richly endowed with coal and iron ore, and these minerals were often located close together in counties such as <xref refid="0"

A minority of these activists were overtly Francophile and some may have wanted a French invasion of Britain and the establishment of a republican regime. Most corresponding-society members, however, seem to have been deeply attached to the British constitution and to have wanted only to reform it. But if these societies were not extensive or proto-revolutionary, they were still important and recognized as such. Contemporaries realized that for the first time in the 18th century working men throughout the nation were beginning to organize to achieve political change.

The militia was increased, and by 1803 more than 380,000 men were acting as volunteers in home-based cavalry and infantry regiments.

                  Despite these financial and military exertions, British governments found it extremely difficult to defeat France. In part this was because Pitt the Younger’s abilities were more suited to peace than to war. But the main reason the conflict was so protracted was France’s overwhelming military superiority on land. The historian Paul Kennedy has written of British and French power in this period:<qt>
                    <qtpara>Like the whale and the elephant, each was by far the largest creature in its own domain. But British control of the sea routes could not by itself destroy the French hegemony in Europe, nor could Napoleon’s military mastery reduce the islanders to surrender.</qtpara>

                <p>The first coalition of anti-French states, consisting of Britain, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Austria, disintegrated by 1796. A British expeditionary force to aid Flanders and Holland was defeated, and Holland was occupied by the French. By 1797 the cost of maintaining its own forces and subsidizing those of its European allies had brought Britain to the verge of bankruptcy. For a time the Bank of England suspended payments in cash.</p>

                <p>Britain’s ultimate success against Napoleon, like its importance in this period as a whole, owed much to its wealth—its capacity to raise loans through its financial machinery and revenue through the prosperity of its inhabitants and the extent of its trade. But British success also owed much to the power of its navy and to the energy and aggressiveness of its ruling class, which was particularly apparent in the imperial expansion of this period. Britain sought to extend its control by legislation, by war, and by individual enterprise. The Acts of Union with Scotland in 1707 and with Ireland in 1801 tightened London’s rule over its Celtic periphery, as did the laws passed to erode the autonomy of the Scottish Highlands after the rebellion of 1745. In the 1760s Britain sought not only to increase the revenue it gained from its North American colonies but also to shore up its military and administrative influence there. These measures failed, but Britain had more success with its Indian possessions. Between 1768 and 1774, in fact, the House of Commons devoted far more time to Indian affairs than to those of North America. Its discussions culminated in the passing of the India Act in 1784, which indicatively increased the government’s authority over the East India Company and therefore over Britain’s possessions in India.</p>

                  </thumbasm>The relationship between state and society in Britain after the Napoleonic Wars assumed the shape that was to remain apparent into the 20th and 21st centuries. In contrast to most other European societies, many of the functions performed by central government elsewhere were performed in Britain by groups of self-governing citizens, either on an elective, but unpaid, official basis, as in the institutions of local government, or through voluntary organizations. Britain in the 19th century did not develop a strong bureaucratic element with interests of its own, a strong sense of popular expectations concerning the role of the state, nor a strong popular sense of identification with it. This understanding of the limited role of government (contemporaries would have used this term rather than the “state”) reflected and served to further entrench what in the 18th century had become a relatively homogeneous and stable society—relative to the great majority of European states, that is. This was particularly so after the integration of Scotland into what was increasingly, with the clear exception of Ireland, a United Kingdom. Internal differences of course remained strong, but, nonetheless, linguistic and geographical unity was paralleled by the increasing integration of communications, seen in the improved road system of the first three decades of the new century, a precursor of the integration later evident in the railway system.
                </p>
                <p>However, this decentralized state combined considerable strength with considerable flexibility; indeed, these two characteristics were mutually reinforcing. Even in the 18th century, central government showed sensitivity to the dangers of trespassing upon the limits of consent. Although in no sense a democratic state, this combination of strength and liberality was made possible by the close link between central government and the decentralized channels through which it ruled. If ruling at a distance often, this rule was all the stronger for being experienced as a kind of freedom. This experience in turn strengthened central government, enabling it all the more firmly to coordinate decentralized rule.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, if liberal, the late 18th- and early 19th-century state was marked by a strong sense of rights, enforceable by law and enjoyed by all members of the community, however unequally, including rights of subsistence by means of the poor-relief system. However limited, the propertied and the powerful felt it their responsibility to uphold these rights, rights that they and the poor and unpropertied regarded as the birthright of the “Free-Born Englishman.” Those with governmental responsibility did not generally try to exclude the mass of the population from at least some participation in the regulation of their own lives. In the courts, by the means of petition, and through attendance at parish meetings, for example, the less powerful could exert some influence. This influence, among both the high and the low in society, was felt to operate at the level of the representation of communities, rather than the individual, and was reflected in the system of parliamentary representation itself. This sense of rights also took the form of strong attachments to customary observances and regulations—for instance, those associated with particular trades and localities, such as the parish. The country was governed through a process of negotiation and reciprocity, albeit between unequal sides, in which what has been called a “rebellious but traditional popular culture” set limits on the power of the governors, while at the same time respecting this power when justly implemented.</p>

                  This was to change in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. The moves of <xref refid="1830480"

This new understanding of government built upon the old liberality of the 18th-century state but divested it of many of the rights intrinsic to it. This involved a reconstruction of the roles of Parliament, the executive, and the party, with the purpose of reducing these to the provision of a framework within which individuals and institutions could operate with maximum safety and freedom. While retaining and modernizing its basic public order and <xref refid="0"

                        tocid="">foreign policy</xref> functions—thereby retaining at the centre a strong directive power—this new notion of government involved stripping away what were perceived to be the great premodern accretions of intrusive legislation, regulation, and custom, particularly in relation to economic activity and the “Old Corruption” of the ancien régime.

                  Instead, what would be constructed were mechanisms that would facilitate the automatic operations of the “natural order” believed to lie beneath and to be prevented from its beneficial operation by the unnecessary weight of custom and regulation created over the centuries. Liberated in this way, it was thought, individuals and the economy would be set free to achieve their full potential. This understanding of government was supported by particular appropriations of <xref refid="0"

                        tocid="">political system</xref> could be equated with the workings of Providence. This understanding of government conflicted with older notions of rights and responsibilities, so that arguments about the role of a strong central state and institutional and personal freedom, as well as the question of what was public and what was private, were at the heart of political discussion throughout the century and, indeed, through the course of the 20th century too. These arguments were reflected in the uneven movement toward the liberalization of society and the economy in the first two decades of the century, though of the direction of this movement there could be no doubt.

                <p>The end of the long wars against Napoleon did not usher in a period of peace and contentment in Britain. Instead, the postwar period was marked by open social conflicts, most of them exacerbated by an economic slump. As the long-run process of industrialization continued, with a rising population and a cyclic pattern of relative prosperity and depression, many social conflicts centred on questions of what contemporaries called “corn and currency”—that is, agriculture and credit. Others were directly related to the growth of factories and towns and to the parallel development of middle-class and working-class consciousness.</p>

Recent historical research indicates that the awareness of class identity was not simply the direct outcome of economic and social experience but was articulated in terms of public discourse, particularly in the political sphere. For example, claims to be middle-class were actively contested in the political life of the time, and different groups, for different purposes, sought to appropriate or stigmatize the term. In the same manner, working-class identity was formed differently by different political and <xref refid="0"

This understanding of how collective identity was politically shaped according to the cultural contexts of the time has marked the formation of collective identities more broadly in British history down to the present.

Bad harvests and high food prices left them hungry and discontented, but it was as much their political as their economic situation that served as the basis of their mobilization. However, new forms of industrial production, as well as the growth of towns with structures of communication that were quite different from those of villages or preindustrial urban communities, enabled new kinds of political appeal and of collective identity to take root.

                  The implementation of the liberal, regulative state emerging after the Napoleonic Wars involved a number of new departures. The first of these concerned the new machinery of government, which, instead of relying on patronage and custom, involved an institutionalized bureaucracy. This was evident in the development of the factory inspectorate, established by the 1833 Factory Act, though the characteristic way in which the state institutionalized itself was by means of local bodies administering such areas as the fast-developing realm of “public health” and the <xref refid="0"

After the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act, local government, if developing unevenly, was a major part of the new machinery of government. There was a great flowering of civic administration and civic pride during the early and mid-Victorian period in Britain. This was particularly reflected in the architecture and infrastructure of British cities—one of the most notable legacies of the period.

Gladstone, Whig and later Liberal prime minister, was the major single influence on the 19th-century liberal state and arguably the most gifted British politician of his time. The liberal state’s attempt to rule through freedom and through the natural order was implemented not merely in social but also in economic terms: Gladstonian finance, particularly the taxation system, was aimed at encouraging the belief that all groups in society had a responsibility for sanctioning and financing government activity and that therefore they should have an incentive to keep it under control.

The outcome of the famine, a disaster for Ireland involving the death or emigration of millions of people, has to be seen in the context of the long-term agenda of the liberal state, which included Ireland as a sort of laboratory for experimentation in this new kind of government (India was a similar kind of laboratory). The experimental methods in the Irish case involved an agenda including population control, the Poor Law relief system, and the consolidation of property through a variety of means, including emigration, the elimination of smallholdings, and the sale of large but bankrupt estates. The government measured the success of its relief policies in terms of this agenda rather than its effectiveness in addressing the immediate question of need. The goal of this agenda was the creation of a society of “rational” small-farm production on the model of the natural order of the free market, rather than the “irrational” production of a mass of small peasant proprietors.

                  However, subsequent implementation of the liberal state—for instance, that of Gladstone—should not be seen simply as guided by the amoral market. In the third quarter of the century, Gladstone’s version of the liberal state represented the apotheosis of the approach to government favoured by the reformer Sir <xref refid="1827525"

                        tocid="">Robert Peel</xref> (the Conservative prime minister from 1834 to 1835 and again from 1841 to 1846). This version of the liberal state took the form of an individualism ostensibly based not upon greed and self-interest but upon probity, self-control, and a sense of duty and Christian morality. In this regard, as indeed much more widely in British history, this version of individualism accorded with many of the beliefs of society in general—not least those held by the working classes—so that the attempt to rule through the moral characteristics of society proved in many respects to be an extraordinarily successful venture in government. Rather like the thinking behind the reformed civil service, the moral rule at the heart of Gladstonian economic reform was designed to establish the neutrality, and therefore the high moral ground, of government: if government were independent of a self-regulating economy, it would also be free from the influence of powerful economic interests. This view of liberal government in the period of Tory power instituted after 1874 changed little and went unchallenged until the late 19th century, even if Tory administrations had a somewhat more positive idea of the state.

                    </thumbasm>As the economic skies darkened after 1836 and prophets such as Carlyle anticipated cataclysmic upheaval, the two most disgruntled groups in society were the industrial workers and their employers. Each group developed new forms of organization, and each turned from local to national extra-parliamentary action. The two most important organizations were the Chartists and the Anti-Corn Law League. <xref refid="1827002"

                          tocid="">Chartism</xref> drew on a multiplicity of workers’ grievances, extending working-class consciousness as it grew. The Anti-Corn Law League, founded as a national organization in Manchester in 1839, was the spearhead of middle-class energies, and it enjoyed the advantage not only of lavish funds but also of a single-point program—the repeal of the restrictive Corn Laws.
                  </p>
                  <p>Taking its name from the People’s Charter published in London in May 1838, Chartism aimed at parliamentary reform. The charter contained six points, all of them political and all with a radical pedigree: (1) annual parliaments, (2) universal male suffrage, (3) the ballot, (4) no property qualifications for members of Parliament, (5) payment of members of Parliament, and (6) equal electoral districts. These were old demands that would have been supported by 18th-century radicals. Localized Poor Law and factory reform agitations centring on such grievances were subsumed in Chartism because of its commitment to national political action. However, for a variety of reasons—not least that the politicians had been able again to convey the sense that the state was benign and neutral and not, as Chartists perceived it, repressive and sectional—the mass movement of Chartism ultimately failed.</p>

There was no time between 1846 and 1866, however, when extra-parliamentary agitation assumed the dimensions it had between 1838 and 1846.

Nonelectors’ associations (representing the disenfranchised) tried with varying degrees of success to keep radical issues alive, but party divisions remained based on customary allegiance as much as on careful scrutiny of issues, and there was still considerable scope for bribery at election times. The civil service might be pure, but the electors often were not. The Corrupt Practices Act of 1854 provided a more exact definition of bribery than there had been before, but it was not until a further act of 1883 that election expenses were rigorously controlled. It was then that, quite emphatically, parliamentary representation became not a matter of communities but of individuals, a process taken a considerable step further in 1872 with institution of electoral secrecy by the Ballot Act.

                  <p>The prestige of the individual members of Parliament was high, and the fragmentation of parties after 1846 allowed them considerable independence. Groups of members supporting particular economic interests, especially the railways, could often determine parliamentary strategies. Nevertheless, contemporaries feared such interests less than they feared what was often called the most dangerous of all interests, executive government. Powerful government and large-scale “organic” reform were considered dangerous, and even those radicals who supported organic reform, like Cobden and Bright, were suspicious of powerful government.</p>

                    </thumbasm>Lord Palmerston, who became prime minister for the first time in 1855, stood out as the dominant political personality of mid-Victorian Britain precisely because he was opposed to dramatic change and because he knew through long experience how to maneuver politics within the half-reformed constitution. In a period when it was difficult to collect parliamentary majorities, he often forced decisions, as in the general election of 1857, on the simple question “Are you for or against me?” He also was skillful in using the growing power of the press to reinforce his influence. At a time of party confusion, when the queen might well have played a key part in politics, Palmerston found the answer to royal opposition in popular prestige, carefully stage-managed.

                    Many of these reforms did not satisfy affected interests.

Although the act was extended in 1880 when primary education was made compulsory and in 1891 when it became free, there were often noisy struggles between churchmen and Nonconformists on the new school boards set up locally under Forster’s act. If the Education Act alienated many Nonconformists, the Licensing Bills of 1871 and 1872 alienated their enemies, the brewers. In the general election of 1874, therefore, months after Disraeli had described the Liberal leaders in one of his many memorable phrases as a “range of exhausted volcanoes,” the brewers threw all their influence behind the Conservatives. “We have been borne down in a torrent of gin and beer,” Gladstone complained.

Nevertheless, over the course of the 19th century, the rise of manufacturing industry was striking, with the decisive shift occurring in the first three decades of the century. In 1801, 22 percent of the active British workforce was employed in manufacturing, mining, and construction, while 36 percent was involved in agriculture; by 1851, manufacturing, mining, and construction had increased to 40 percent, while agriculture had dropped to 21 percent. By 1901, agriculture had fallen even farther, to only 9 percent.

                  </thumbasm>Cotton textiles remained the dominant new industry, centred in Manchester, with the textile factory being thought of by one of its contemporary admirers, the Leeds manufacturer Edward Baines, as “the most striking example of the dominion obtained by human science over the powers of nature of which modern times can boast.” By 1851 there were some 1,800 cotton factories in Britain. From 1815 to 1851 raw cotton imports had increased unevenly from 101 million pounds to 757 million pounds, while exports of manufactured cotton piece goods increased from 253 million yards to 1.543 billion yards. Manchester was the centre of the cotton industry. During the same period, however, similar steam-driven technology accounted for the expansion of the woolen textiles industry, with Australia, which had provided no raw wool for Britain in 1815, supplying about 30 million pounds in 1851. <xref refid="1825995"

The advent of mass consumption in the second half of the 19th-century—resulting in the slow development of mass retailing by multiple stores—was one consequence of this. While the factory and mechanized production played important roles in the process of industrialization, this process has been usefully described as “combined and uneven development.” Undoubtedly, hand technology and muscle power continued to play a considerable role far beyond the mid-19th century, and, as older forms of production continued alongside new, they were incorporated in, and to some extent regenerated by, factory production. The artisan sector, the conduct of work in people’s homes, and subcontracting all remained central to many industries—for example, the hosiery industry in <xref refid="1826131"

Even in mechanized industries, managerial hierarchies were weakly elaborated, and there was a considerable dependence on worker skill and authority as well as a limited penetration of technology. Also of great importance were domestic service and small shop keeping. The upshot was not a linear process of change in which the end result was de-skilled factory production and the homogenization of the condition of workers but rather a complex set of outcomes in which the relations of capital and labour represented a variegated division of power.

In the first census of 1801, the population of England and Wales was about 9 million and that of Scotland about 1.5 million. By 1851 the comparable figures were 18 million and 3 million. At its peak in the decade between 1811 and 1821, the growth rate for Britain as a whole was 17 percent. It took time to realize that <xref refid="1826177"

There was as much argument among contemporaries about the impact of railways as there was about the impact of steam engines in factories, but there was general agreement about the fact that the coming of the railway marked a great divide in British social history. It was not until the 1870s and ’80s that steamship production came to its full realization, and by then British engineers and workers had been responsible for building railways in all parts of the world. By 1890 Britain had more registered shipping tonnage than the rest of the world put together.

                    It was in this period that private life achieved a new prominence in British society. The very term “Victorianism,” perhaps the only “ism” in history attached to the name of a sovereign, not only became synonymous with a cluster of restraining moral attributes—character, duty, will, earnestness, hard work, respectable comportment and behaviour, and thrift—but also came to be strongly associated with a new version of private life. <xref refid="0"

                  </p>
                  <p>However, privacy was more apparent for the better-off in society than for the poor. Restrictions on privacy among the latter were apparent in what were by modern standards large households, in which space was often shared with those outside the immediate, conjugal family of the head of household, including relatives, servants, and lodgers. Privacy was also restricted by the small size of dwellings; for example, in Scotland in 1861, 26 percent of the population lived in single-room dwellings, 39 percent in two-room dwellings, and 57 percent lived more than two to a room. It was not until the 20th century that this situation changed dramatically. Nonetheless, differences within Britain were important, and flat living in a Glasgow tenement was very different from residence in a self-contained house characteristic of large parts of the north of England. This British kind of residential pattern as a whole was itself very different from continental Europe, and despite other differences between the classes, there were similarities among the British in terms of the house as the cradle of modern privacy. The suggestive term “social privacy” has been coined to describe the experience of domestic space prior to the intervention of the municipality and the state in the provision of housing, which occurred with increasing effect after mid-century. The older cellular structure of housing, evident in the tangle of courts and alleys in the old city centres, often with cellar habitations as well, resulted in the distinction between public and private taking extremely ambiguous form. In the municipal housing that was increasingly widespread after mid-century, this gave way to a more open layout in which single elements were connected to each other.</p>
                  <p>Among housing reformers there was a dislike of dead ends, courts, and the old situation where habitations were turned in upon themselves in their own social privacy. In the new order, space became neutral and connective, and, in the new “bylaw housing,” streets were regular in layout and width, with side streets at right angles and back alleys in parallel lines. The streets outside were (and remain) surprisingly wide in contrast to the narrow alleys behind. Such streets allowed a maximum of free passage. The street outside was public and communal. The alley or lane behind was less socially neutral than the street, still rather secret. It was not a traffic thoroughfare for the public at large, being reserved for the immediate inhabitants, for the hanging of washing, and perhaps for the playing of football (soccer). In between these public and semipublic spheres and the house within was the space of the yard at the back, which in contradistinction to the street was private and individual (if less so, potentially, than the house itself). In this fashion, municipal authorities sought to inculcate privacy in the lower classes. However, conditions worked against domestic privacy for them, and it was in the homes of the better-off that privacy was most developed.</p>
                  <p>
                    Within the dwellings of the more privileged, there was a trend towards the specialization of rooms, the separation of the public from the private sides of life, and the development of distinct spheres for women and children. A society based on achieved status, as British society was slowly becoming, was very concerned to regulate and legitimize social relationships of gender and status, and the spaces of the home served as a means of doing this. From about the 1820s a family pattern developed that was conditioned by spatial environments that resulted from the new significance of home and domesticity. The home was to be a retreat from the stress of the world and a haven of security. This change in perspective was associated with other developments, namely the retreat from the centre of cities to the suburbs—evident in Manchester, for example, as early as the 1820s—along with a concomitant switch in housing style from the 18th-century terrace (row houses) to the detached or semidetached villa. In the move from the terrace, what was once the common garden of the square gave way to a separate, private garden. The common and more public rooms of the house, which were once for use by all members of the family, were relocated on the ground floor, with the other stories of the house being limited to the use of family members in a distinct domestic sphere. In terms of the development of working-class domesticity, by mid-century there was a clear gender <xref refid="0"

Families were large and intermarried so that the boundaries between the categories of relative, dependent, and friend were indistinct, recalling an older notion of family as the circle of dependents. The relationship between public and private was therefore similarly complicated. Because the domestic interior could be the site of all sorts of familial and extra-familial interactions and obligations, the nexus of private life might also be distinctly public. Of course, privacy was accelerated by means other than family and domestic arrangements. The spread of reading on one’s own and of letter writing, the latter of which increased massively with the development of the cheap Penny Post, were both conducive to privacy.

                    Moreover, privacy in life led to privacy in death, as what may be called social burial in the old churchyard gave way to the new privacy of the cemetery. An invention of this time (Kensal Green, the first specialist London cemetery, opened in 1831), the cemetery was a new sort of public space, which in theory welcomed all comers, though in practice it was open only to the better-off, at least at first.

                    For the privileged minority, however, leisure defined a good deal of their existence, the model of aristocratic “society” being redeployed in the early 19th century. Even in the 18th century the “middling sort” well-to-do of the towns, the urban gentry, had adopted the assembly room (where the elite had gathered to dance and socialize), the theatre, and the promenade as a means of regulating and enjoying urban life. This growth of a provincial <xref refid="0"

In the first three decades of the new century this more serious aspect became increasingly apparent through the impact of the growth of Evangelical religion and of political events both at home and in Europe, so that there was a shift from the older sociability of propertied urban culture to a new emphasis on the deployment of leisure and culture as means of negotiating social and political difficulties, especially in the new and growing towns and cities.
                  </p>
                  <p>The idea of “recreation” began to emerge; that is, that nonwork time should be a time of re-creating the body and mind for the chief purpose of work. The idea grew too that this recreation should be “rational.” The characteristic institutions of these new initiatives were the Mechanics Institutes for labourers and the Atheneaums for the sons—though not the daughters—of the more wealthy. Beyond these institutions there was the remarkable growth of those concerned with bringing culture to propertied urbanites, notably art galleries. However, it was not until mid-century that such initiatives began to develop rapidly, as in Manchester in the 1850s, where the Halle Orchestra was established on a professional basis and its concerts opened to anyone who could pay admission, unlike earlier, purely subscription-based music organizations. In the same decade, Owens College, the forerunner of the University of Manchester, was founded. The development of these institutions marked the emergence a more self-consciously public middle-class culture, one remodelled around a more open and inclusive notion of what public life involved.</p>

At the same time, a number were retained, being transformed to serve new purposes in the changed circumstances of increasing urbanization and industrialization. For instance, the old, established local “feast” and “wake” days of the industrial districts in the north of England were retained, serving many of the old communal functions yet also changing character and obtaining new functions in light of the spread of the railway and the advent of the modern vacation. Communal identities might now be formed by leaving the towns en masse, either for the railway excursion or on holiday, when large sections of the workers from particular towns took their leisure together at the new seaside resorts such as <xref refid="1826289"

Commercial pressures in fact were most responsible for reshaping what had at least from the late 18th century been identified as popular culture, as opposed to forms of high culture.

Of course, in practice, parks served other purposes, but their place in what was a widespread and marked reshaping of popular manners should not be underestimated. This reshaping owed a great deal to the beneficiaries of reform themselves, in that some of the most vocal supporters of the reform of the old order of “superstition and brutality” were radical workingmen whose conception of reason pitted them against the old culture. They were joined by Dissenter workingmen who were equally uncomfortable with traditional culture. Commercial and reform interests combined in the proliferation of reading matter for the “popular classes.” Indeed, the creation of a literate population was one of the most striking achievements of the century, but, while journals and books advocating self-improvement reached a surprisingly wide audience, this readership was not as wide as that of the sensational popular literature of the 1830s and ’40s. About this time a mass popular press also developed, though at this stage a Sunday press only, in the form of <e>Lloyd’s News</e> and <e>Reynolds’s Weekly Newspaper</e>. The explosion of the provincial press in the 1850s reached a somewhat different social constituency but was tremendously important in constituting the sense of identity of the towns that it served.

One consequence of this and other developments was the growth of movements aimed at “national efficiency” as a means of establishing a more effective state machine. The recognition of social problems at home—such as the “discovery” of urban poverty in 1880s in the assumed presence of plenty and increasing anxiety about the “labour question”—also raised questions about the adequacy of the state in dealing with the mounting problems of an increasingly populous and complex society. Toward the end of the century, the possibility of a violent outcome in the increasingly intractable problem of Ireland brought existing constitutional methods into question. Behind much of this anxiety was a sense that the Third Reform Act of 1884 (<e>see</e> <xref refid="1826347"

                  This rethinking revolved around the belief that the operation of the state must incorporate consideration of the collective characteristics of society—that is, solidarity, interdependence, and common identity—in a much more direct way than hitherto. Indeed, the idea of the “social” came to characterize the entire period and even much later eras. Notions of a distinct social sphere, separate from the economic and political realms, had emerged much earlier, based upon the idea that the characteristics of this social realm were evident in the biological, vital characteristics of populations, so that society was very often understood in organic terms. The influence of Malthus in the early 19th century and Darwin in the mid-19th century contributed powerfully to this worldview, giving rise to late 19th-century representations of society in the strongly biological terms of “social <xref refid="1826694"

                        tocid="">eugenics</xref>” and other variations of “racial” thought, such as the idea of the “degeneration” of the working class. From about the turn of the 20th century, the concept of the social realm as autonomous developed alongside and partly incorporated older understandings. The social question became a sociological question, as indeed it has remained until very recently in British history. Society was now understood, unlike in earlier times, to work according to its own laws and to be divorced from moral questions, although, in practice, political interventions were invariably designed to change moral behaviour.

                <p>
                  One major result of this questioning of the state and of new conceptions of society was the extensive social legislation of the Liberal administrations after 1905, which is widely seen as the foundation of the 20th-century <xref refid="1826697"

The Old Age Pensions Act (1908) granted pensions under prescribed conditions to people over age 70, and in 1908 the miners were given a statutory working day of eight hours. In 1909 trade boards were set up to fix wages in designated industries in which there was little or no trade union strength, and labour exchanges were created to try to reduce unemployment. In 1911 the National Insurance Act was passed, whereby the state and employers supplemented employees’ contributions towards protection against unemployment and ill health. This act clearly represented a departure from the manner in which government had been carried out, as it began to be executed in supposed accordance with the social characteristics of the governed (age, family circumstances, gender, labour). Under this new dispensation, individual rights, as well as the rights of families, were secured not by individual economic action but by state action and by the provision of pensions and benefits. These new rights were secured as social rights, so that individual rights were connected to a web of obligations, rights, and solidarities extending across the individual’s life, across the lives of all individuals in a population, and between individuals across generations—in short, a network of relations that was in fact one early version of society as a sui generis entity.

                  However, much of this new relationship of state and society was still recognizably liberal in the older sense, constituting a compact of social and individual responsibility. At the heart of this compact was the belief that it was necessary to safeguard the individual from the unfettered operation of the free market, while at the same time making sure that there must be an obligation to obtain gainful employment.

                        tocid="">David Lloyd George</xref>, who did most to push the legislation through, himself combined these characteristics of old and new liberalism. At the same time, in practice this new formula of government emerged in a very piecemeal and haphazard way, often driven by the circumstances of the moment, not least the circumstances of party politics. Moreover, the circumstances of war were of overwhelming importance. It was World War I in particular that fostered the idea of the increased importance of the interventionist, collectivist state. The demands of winning the war required an unparalleled intervention in a running of the economy and in the operations of social life, particularly when the radical Liberal Lloyd George took power in 1916. Perhaps the most important factor legitimizing the increased role of the state was conscription in the armed services, and the most important general outcome was the idea that “planning” (understood in many different ways) was from this point forward a fully legitimate part of governmental enterprise. Nonetheless, despite the piecemeal nature of the change, what is striking is how this understanding of the relationship between state and society obtained across the whole political spectrum and how it lasted so long. This increased role of the state was accompanied, after World War I, by the increasing specialization and professionalization of an expanding civil service.

This development was already foreshadowed in the cabinet that Gladstone assembled, which was neither socially uniform nor politically united. Eight of the 11 members were Whigs, but one of the other three—Chamberlain—represented a new and aggressive urban radicalism, less interested in orthodox statements of liberal individualism than in the uncertain aspiration and striving of the different elements in the mass electorate. At the opposite end of the spectrum from Chamberlain’s municipal socialism were the Whigs, the largest group in the cabinet but the smallest group in the country. Many of them were already abandoning the Liberal Party; all of them were nervous about the kind of radical program that Chamberlain and the newly founded National Liberal Federation (1877) were advocating and about the kind of caucus-based party organization that Chamberlain favoured locally and nationally. For the moment, however, Gladstone was the man of the hour, and Chamberlain himself conceded that he was indispensable.

Thus, an “informal empire” had been created that was as much dependent on Britain as the formal empire was. Nonetheless, even during these years, as a result of pressure from the periphery, the process of establishing protectorates or of acquiring colonies had never halted, despite a number of colonial crises and small colonial wars in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the new acquisitions were located in tropical areas of the world and were populated mainly by non-Europeans.
                  </p>
                  <p>There were further crises during the 1880s and ’90s, when the Liberals were divided on both tactics and objectives, and public opinion was stirred. When Chamberlain chose to take over the Colonial Office in 1895, he was acknowledging the opportunities, both economic and political, afforded by a vast “undeveloped estate.” The same radical energies that he had once devoted to civic improvement were now directed toward imperial problems. The argument about empire assumed an increasingly popular dimension. Boys’ books and magazines, for example, focused on the adventure of empire and the courage and sense of duty of empire builders, and textbooks often taught the same lessons. So also did the popular press. In consequence, the language of imperialism changed.</p>

                  <p>It was difficult for the British voter to understand or to appreciate this network of motives and interests.

                    In the course of the struggle over the Parliament bill, strong, even violent, feelings had been roused among lords who had seldom bothered hitherto to attend their house. Their intransigence provided a keynote to four years of equally fierce struggle on many other issues in the country, with different sectional groups turning to noisy direct action. The Liberals remained in power, carrying important new legislation, but they faced so much opposition from extremists, who cared little about either conventional political behaviour or the rule of law, that these years have been called by the American historian George Dangerfield “the strange death of Liberal England.” The most important legislation was once more associated with Lloyd George—the National Insurance Act of 1911, which Parliament accepted without difficulty but which was the subject of much hostile criticism in the press and was bitterly opposed by doctors and duchesses. Nor did it win unanimous support from labour. The parliamentary <xref refid="0"

Old-fashioned trade unionists were almost as unpopular with the rank and file as they were with capitalists. In June 1914, less than two months before the outbreak of World War I, a “triple alliance” of transport workers, miners, and railwaymen was formed to buttress labour solidarity. In parallel to labour agitation, the suffragists, fighting for women’s rights, resorted to militant tactics that not only embarrassed Asquith’s government but tested the whole local and national machinery for maintaining order. The Women’s Social and Political Union, founded in 1903, was prepared to encourage illegal acts, including bombing and arson, which led to sharp police retaliation, severe sentences, harsh and controversial treatment in prison, and even martyrdom.

                <p>Changes in economic conditions during the last decades of the 19th century were of crucial importance. Mid-Victorian prosperity had reached its peak in a boom that collapsed in 1873. Thereafter, although national income continued to increase (nearly quadrupling between 1851 and 1911), there was persistent pressure on profit margins, with a price fall that lasted until the mid-1890s. Contemporaries talked misleadingly of a “great depression,” but, however misleading the phrase was as a description of the movement of economic indexes, the period as a whole was one of doubt and tension. There was anxious concern about both markets and materials, but the retardation in the national rate of growth to below 2 percent per annum was even harder to bear because the growth rates of competitors were rising, sometimes in spectacular fashion.</p>

                  The interests of different sections of the community diverged between 1870 and 1900 as they had before the mid-Victorian period. In particular, grain- and meat-producing farmers bore the full weight of foreign competition in cereals, and many, though not all, industrialists felt the growing pressure of foreign competition in both old and new industries.

In 1877 the price of English wheat stood at 56 shillings 9 pence a quarter (compared with 54 shillings 6 pence in 1846); for the rest of the century, it never again came within 10 shillings of that figure. During the 1890s, therefore, there was a sharp fall in rent, a shift in land ownership, and a challenge to the large estate in the cereal-growing and meat-producing areas of the country. The fact that dairy and fruit farmers flourished did not relieve the pessimism of most spokesmen for the threatened landed interests.

But it also contributed to domestic obsolescence, particularly in the old industries. Thus, ultimately, there was a price to pay for imperial glory.

Those in transport and communications almost doubled in number to 1,500,000, while those who worked in the manufacture of metal, machines, implements, and vehicles increased from almost 1,000,000 to over 2,000,000. Those in mining also doubled in number, to 1,200,000 in 1921. These were the real growth areas in the economy. The number of individuals involved in the agricultural sector, on the other hand, declined but exceeded 1,250,000 in 1921 and thus made up a still important component of the occupational structure of the country. All other sectors remained stable or lost workers, with the growth industry of the early 19th century, textiles and clothing, decreasing from about 1,000,000 to 750,000 workers in 1921.

                  The economy lost a good deal of its old artisan character. Accompanying this erosion of artisan power at the point of production were some tendencies toward increases of scale in factory production. To some degree there also was a decline in the old hierarchies of skill, most notably in the erosion of the position of artisans, the mid-Victorian labour aristocracy. At the same time, the characteristics of the social structure of production in the preceding period were still apparent, namely “combined and uneven” development, whereby old and new forms of industrial organization and production methods were often combined, and overall development was not uniform. The result was that skill and authority were still distributed in a very complex way throughout industry. Older historical accounts concerning the late 19th- and early 20th-century formation of an increasingly de-skilled and uniform labour force have given way to a more nuanced picture, so that the rise of the <xref refid="0"

This shift did much to reshape women’s changing understanding of themselves, particularly among the middle classes, where the more public world of work called into question exclusively domestic definitions of femininity.

Within the textile industry, women’s trade unions made some headway, but it is testimony to the power of traditional paternalist understandings of gender relationships among workers that male authority still obtained for the most part in both the home and the workplace, where women were excluded from the better-paid and more-skilled jobs. Domestic service was still the bedrock of women’s employment, comprising some 1,750,000 workers in 1881 out of a total of 3,900,000, though by 1921 this number had grown to 1,800,000 but shrunk in relative importance.

                <p>The structure of families in this period was still relatively diverse and significantly unlike 21st-century versions of the nuclear family based upon co-residing parents and young children. There is some evidence to suggest that industrialization strengthened rather than weakened kinship ties and intergenerational co-residence, because of the practical help resident grandparents could render to working mothers. Relationships across generations, both within and outside the household, continued to be important. Despite the migration of production from home to factory, the traditional identity of the family as a productive unit survived quite strongly into the 20th century, notably among shopkeepers and other self-employed workers, among tenant farmers, and particularly among the still important area of “homework” production, which, as a component of the late 19th-century clothing industry, went through a massive revival. The family retained many residual economic roles and acquired some new ones. For example, there was still a strong tendency for occupations to pass from father to son in all classes. The economy of workers, however, was much more likely to involve the collective earnings of father, mother, and children, compared with the family economy of those who were better-off.</p>

During this period, the situation was to undergo remarkable changes as the law began to make inroads into not only the rights of husbands but also the rights of parents generally. By the end of this period, legal intervention had largely eroded the absolute paternal rights enshrined in the common law, although sexual relations between husbands and wives remained largely untouched by legal change.

The period was therefore to see changes within marriage in the direction of greater independence for women, as well as changes in the status and independence of women outside marriage. At the same time, the legal and administrative code remained decidedly biased against women; for instance, income tax was framed as a duty of the male head of household. In terms of what might be called upper-middle-class society, traditional gender roles were still extremely powerful: girls were educated at home up to World War I and were trained for the social conventions of home life and home management; boys were sent to school, often to boarding school; and more companionate versions of spousal relationship were accompanied by the preservation of distance between parents and children, with much child care still being left to servants.

                <p>Class distinctions in cultural life continued to be very important. “Rational recreation” (productive and socially responsible recreation) remained an aim of those who wished to reform the culture of the lower classes. However, it also came to characterize the provision of recreation for the upper classes too. The idea of “playing the game” and “the game for its own sake” represented an extension of rational recreation into the sphere of sports, particularly as developed in the public schools, which in this period were reformed so as to institute a sense of public duty and private responsibility among the propertied classes. The cult of the disinterested amateur was part of the notion of the classically trained English gentleman, whose education and sense of moral duty purportedly created a moral superiority and disinterestedness that uniquely fitted him to rule. The development of popular forms of literature aimed at boys in this period served to glorify this particular manifestation of gentlemanly rule. More broadly, the model of the reformed public school itself, as well as a reformed Oxbridge (the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge had been restructured in large part somewhat earlier to meet the needs of a changing, moralized civil service), came to have a considerable influence on educational institutions in Britain. The masculine emphasis in sports was complemented by the club life of the upper classes, which, while always decidedly masculine, in the 1880s and ’90s, in terms of the development of London clubland, served even more to emphasize expressions of masculine identity in leisure activities.</p>
                <p>
                  The move from the sociability that characterized upper-class culture in the 18th century to the more didactic, socially concerned interventions of the early and mid-19th century gave way to a gradual involvement in hitherto forbidden forms, forms now suitably sanitized and made rational (or, as in the case of classical music, made sacred). It was not only music that became respectable but also the reading of novels, the playing of cards, and theatre attendance. The growth of the “legitimate” theatre from the 1880s, in distinction to more popular, melodramatic forms, is indicative of this development. Institutions and locations that were defined by associations with class especially harboured these changes, most notably the school and the suburb. As the transport system developed, especially the expansion of railway commuting from the 1870s and ’80s, suburban life grew in importance, most notably in London. However, it was not only the propertied in society who sought to create rational recreation: in continuance of earlier attempts to influence change from within the labouring population, the reform of low culture was sought by the appeal to high culture in radical and socialist movements such as the<xref refid="1833045"

                  However, this very negotiation of the hitherto forbidden cultural forms also represented a qualification of the class character of culture and the development of what came increasingly to be called “mass culture.” In part this represented a nationalization of cultural life that reflected the increasing importance of a mass polity. Britain also became a more centralized, homogeneous national society. But a simple, linear development toward uniform experience had not characterized British history. The earlier development of modern British society had seen an emphasis on the significance of local and regional cultures, which echoed and reflected the relationship between state and society. While the four nations of the British Isles had constituted a unitary state since the end of the 18th century, Britain remained in the early and mid-19th century a society that was highly diverse and localized. Different cultural, religious, and legal traditions reinforced the very diverse occupational and manufacturing structure that industrialization brought with it. The importance of political decentralization was reflected in very strong municipal cultures, so that the <xref refid="0"

                  </thumbasm>While organized sports might express regional loyalties, their increasingly organized and commercialized basis—whereby rules were drawn up, leagues founded, and competitions inaugurated—served to coordinate local loyalties on a national basis. National bodies were created, along with national audiences. Spectatorship gave way to participation among all classes. In this sense, a “mass” culture was evident.

Indeed, professional football has only relatively recently lost its working-class character in Britain.

                    Lloyd George governed Britain with a small “War Cabinet” of five permanent members, only one of whom was a politician of standing. Although Lloyd George had to take note of the opinions of Parliament and of those around him and pay attention to the tides of public political sentiment, the power to make decisions rested entirely with him. He was faced with the same sentiments of apathy, discontent with the country’s leadership, and war weariness that had brought down the Asquith government. Not only had Britain’s supreme military effort in 1916 failed, but the war had lost its meaning. The British commitment to defend Belgium (which had brought Britain into the war in the first place) was forgotten, still more the Austro-Hungarian actions against Serbia (which had not particularly troubled Britain anyway). Thus, in the next two years, Lloyd George set out to reinvest the war with meaning. Its purpose would be to create a better Britain and a safer world. Victory promised hope for the future. Toward that goal he established new ministries and brought workingmen into government. Lloyd George’s reconstruction program was built on principles that were later enunciated by U.S. Pres.<xref refid="990231"

Worse, Lloyd George had no party organization in the country. The division within the Liberal Party hardened during the controversy over a statement he made in April 1918 concerning the strength of troops in France. Although this controversy, the so-called Maurice Debate (which took place on May 9), strengthened Lloyd George temporarily, it also made clear his dependence upon the Conservatives. Soon afterward, in the summer of 1918, he began to plan what he expected to be a wartime general election to be entered into in coalition with the Conservatives. The sudden armistice of November 11, 1918, however, intervened, and the wartime election became a victory election. Meanwhile, the Labour Party had withdrawn its support from the coalition and called upon Labour members to resign. Most, but not all, did.

Ironically, the election registered the lowest voter turnout of any election in the 20th century, reflecting in part the teething troubles of the Labour Party, whose share of the vote was only 20 percent. Further, 37 seats were added to the House of Commons. Even though the coalition was returned to office, the real winners of the election were the Conservatives. Lloyd George’s Liberals and the Conservatives, who had arranged not to contest seats against each other, together won 473 of the 707 seats. Liberals loyal to Lloyd George won 127 seats, while the Asquithian Liberal Party was nearly wiped out, returning only 36 members as compared with the Labour Party’s 57.

The Liberal organization in the country was in shambles. Finally, the election had focused not upon the reconstruction of Britain, as the leaders of each party had intended, but on the punishment of Germany after the war, a matter the government had hoped to defer. The election had committed the British government to a harsh peace.

As a consequence, issues within the United Kingdom, such as unemployment, poor housing, Irish separatism, and the revival of industry, were too frequently neglected.

Unemployment insurance was extended to virtually all workers, and a serious attempt was made to begin a public housing program. Railroads were reorganized, and for three years after the war coal mines remained in public hands. This restructuring of industry, however, came to an end with the serious rise in unemployment that began in 1920 and culminated in 1921 in a full-scale industrial depression with nearly one-fourth of the labour force out of work. One of the factors in the depression was a disastrous coal strike in April 1921, caused in considerable measure by the collapse of world coal prices resulting from German coal reparations to France. The immediate effect of the economic depression was a demand by the Conservatives for government economy that the prime minister could not ignore.

By the spring of 1921, however, with the Belfast government in operation and with demands both in Britain and in the rest of the world that the fighting in Ireland come to an end, compromise became possible. In the summer a truce was arranged, and on December 6, 1921, after prolonged negotiations, the British government and the Irish rebels signed a so-called treaty allowing the establishment of what was, in effect, a dominion government in Dublin.

Baldwin seemed an unlikely leader for a major party; he had been in Parliament for 15 years without making a mark. Yet behind the unassuming demeanour was a crafty politician. Baldwin understood, as perhaps his predecessors had not, that the British voter, certainly the middle-class voter, desired not excitement and reform but tranquillity. Nostalgia for the assumed stability of prewar Britain was strong and indeed a key to the politics of the 1920s. This frame of mind would contrast sharply with Britain’s mood after World War II.

                  <p>
                    The new Conservative government was faced with high unemployment, industrial stagnation, foreign debts, and continuing demand for economy in government. Baldwin’s response was to abandon Britain’s historic policy of free trade and to return to import duties. Although he was supported in this by a majority of his party, he nonetheless promised to hold an election on the subject before implementing such a policy. Consequently, on December 6, 1923, a second election was held in which the Conservatives lost their comfortable majority; indeed, though they controlled the largest number of seats (258) in the House of Commons, the now-united Liberal Party (159) and Labour (191) combined to win a majority. As a result, on January 22, 1924, the first Labour government in British history, under Prime Minister <xref refid="1052668"

                  <p>MacDonald remained in office only nine months and accomplished little except the revival of the public housing program abandoned by the Lloyd George administration under Conservative pressure. During his time in office he was continually charged in the House of Commons and in the newspapers with unseemly weakness toward the Bolshevik government of the Soviet Union and with an unwillingness to deal firmly with purported revolutionary socialist conspiracies within the United Kingdom. Over this matter the Liberals finally turned against him, and on October 29, 1924, in an election dominated by charges of Soviet influence, MacDonald was heavily defeated. Baldwin returned to the prime ministership, backed by a majority of more than two to one over Labour and the Liberals combined. The Liberal representation in the House of Commons was reduced to 40.</p>
                  <p>
                    Baldwin’s return to office coincided with the French evacuation of the Ruhr valley in Germany and the revival of Germany as an economic power. In the nearly five years of the second Baldwin government, Britain experienced relative economic prosperity, although unemployment never went below the 10 percent of the working population covered by unemployment insurance. A new collapse in domestic coal prices, however, caused by the revival of German coal mining, produced the threat of a second strike by British coal miners. It erupted in May 1926 with a walkout in the coal industry and a sympathy strike by the rest of Britain’s organized labour. Except as a monument in the history of British labour, however, this so-called general strike is as unimportant as it was unsuccessful. As a general strike, it lasted only 10 days, from May 3 to May 12. The miners themselves held out for nearly eight months and were finally starved into returning as winter began, at lower wages and with longer hours. Economically, the chief effect of the strike was to hasten the decay of the huge British coal industry. However, Baldwin’s handling of it—he prepared emergency services but then did nothing—greatly increased his popularity; indeed, he is remembered as a peacemaker, although his government passed an act declaring general strikes to be revolutionary and hence illegal.

                  <p>Baldwin dissolved the House of Commons in the spring of 1929, expecting to be returned. Instead, on May 30 MacDonald’s Labour Party received 288 seats compared with the Conservative Party’s 260, with the Liberals again holding the balance of power, with 59 seats. Thus, MacDonald formed his second government, again with Liberal consent, if not support. The Liberals could do little else. In 1924 Labour, by its inaction, had proved itself as a responsible rather than a revolutionary party. In the minds of Britons, Labour had replaced the Liberals as the natural alternative party.</p>

                  <p>Chamberlain, rather than Baldwin, has always been regarded as the man of appeasement. Historically this is correct only in the sense that Chamberlain formulated a policy of accommodation with Germany and Italy. But Chamberlain was also the man who began British rearmament, pronounced appeasement a failure, and declared war upon Germany. Baldwin was equally zealous to avoid any sort of confrontation with the European dictators while doing as little as possible to strengthen Britain’s armed forces.</p>

It quickly became apparent that the revolutionaries were supported by Italy and, to a lesser extent, Germany, not only with money and arms but also with men. The British reaction, adopted also by the French, was peculiar. Although, according to public opinion polls begun in 1937, less than 3 percent of the British population favoured a Francoist victory, British policy was to forbid the supply of arms to either side. By this policy of nonintervention the British and the French avoided involvement in war against Franco and by implication against the Italian government. The pursuit of friendship with Italy could continue. Meanwhile, the democratic Spanish government was unable to buy arms from the Western democracies. Franco eventually triumphed in the spring of 1939. (<e>See also</e> <xref refid="1808518"

From the last meeting, held at Munich on September 30, he took back what he believed to be an agreement that the German portions of Czechoslovakia constituted Hitler’s last territorial claim in Europe and that Germany, as well as Britain, would renounce war as a means of settling international claims. He had, he said with some pride, brought “peace for our time.”

                    Chamberlain’s policy failed because he believed that Hitler sincerely aimed only at reuniting Germans, whereas in fact Hitler’s appetite for territory, particularly to the east, was unlimited. On March 15, 1939, the German army, virtually without warning, occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia, even though it was not inhabited by Germans. On March 18 Chamberlain, distinctly angry, made an announcement that amounted to the end of appeasement; in the following weeks Britain offered a guarantee of Polish territory (where Hitler would clearly be looking next), signed a military alliance with <xref refid="0"

The second, heroic phase, when Britain stood alone, began with the battle for survival in the air over the British Isles and ended in the first week of December 1941 with the successful Soviet defense of Moscow after Hitler’s attack on June 22 and with the Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire on December 7.

Churchill thus was in charge of the Royal Navy on April 9 and 10, 1940, when Hitler without warning overran Denmark and Norway, greatly extending his northern flank and virtually destroying the naval blockade of Germany that had been established at the beginning of the war.</p>

A bitter debate lasting from May 7 to May 9, 1940, resulted in Chamberlain’s resignation the next day. Although Churchill himself, as first lord of the admiralty, was heavily involved and did not attempt to deny his responsibility, Chamberlain quickly discovered that the coalition government he hoped to establish with either himself or <xref refid="1808541"

                  <p>Perhaps the important political lesson of World War II lay in the realization that a democratic country, with a centuries-old tradition of individual liberty, could with popular consent be mobilized for a gigantic national effort. The compulsory employment of labour became universal for both men and women. In 1943 Britain was devoting 54 percent of its gross national product to the war. Medical services were vastly extended. Civilian consumption was reduced to 80 percent of the prewar level. Yet by and large the political tensions that had accompanied an equally desperate war 25 years before did not appear. Politics, as opposed to the direction of the war, certainly for the voters, became almost irrelevant. There was some parliamentary criticism of Churchill’s leadership, but public approval, at least as measured by repeated opinion polls, hardly wavered. Nonetheless, the idea of a ‘‘united’’ country was overplayed then, and, in the eyes of some, has been overplayed since. The old divisions of class and gender were never far below the surface, and it is only with considerable qualification that World War II can be called the People’s War.</p>

Churchill believed Attlee to have been initially sympathetic, but other members of the Labour Party pressed for departure. As a result, Churchill dissolved the government on May 23, appointed a new, single-party Conservative government, and set election day for July 5. Because it was necessary to count the military vote, the results could not be announced until July 26.

                    Labour rejoiced at its political triumph, the first independent parliamentary majority in the party’s history, but it faced grave problems. The war had stripped Britain of virtually all its foreign financial resources, and the country had built up “sterling credits”—debts owed to other countries that would have to be paid in foreign currencies—amounting to several billion pounds. Moreover, the economy was in disarray. Some industries, such as aircraft manufacture, were far larger than was now needed, while others, such as railways and coal mines, were desperately short of new equipment and in bad repair. With nothing to export, Britain had no way to pay for imports or even for food.

The Conservatives could hardly argue that any of these industries, barring electric power, was flourishing or that they could have done much differently.

Although Wilson was thought to be a Labour radical and had attracted a substantial party following on this account, he was in fact a moderate. His government inherited the problems that had accumulated during the long period of Conservative prosperity: poor labour productivity, a shaky pound, and trade union unrest. His prescription for improvement included not only a widely heralded economic development plan, to be pursued with the introduction of the most modern technology, but also stern and unpopular controls on imports, the devaluation of the pound, wage restraint, and an attempt, in the event these measures proved unsuccessful, to reduce the power of the trade unions. Eventually the Wilson government became unpopular and was kept in power primarily by weakness and division in the Conservative Party. Finally, in 1968, Wilson was confronted with an outbreak of civil rights agitation in Northern Ireland that quickly degenerated into armed violence.

In fact, Heath was defeated by the trade unions, which simply boycotted his industrial legislation, and by the Arab oil embargo, which began in 1973 and which made a national coal miners’ strike in the winter of 1973–74 particularly effective. Heath used the strongest weapon available to a prime minister—a general election, on February 28, 1974—to settle the issue of who governed Britain. The election, held when factories were in operation only three days a week and civilian Britain was periodically reduced to candlelight, was a repudiation of the policy of confrontation with labour.

Like the accompanying deindustrialization of what had been a manufacturing Britain, this transformation of the transportation infrastructure had immense consequences, resulting in a public transport system that was widely perceived as chaotic and inefficient, as well as in a great increase in private automobile use and in road building.

                    Partly in response to this development but also prompted by long-simmering tensions, a series of disturbances broke out in British cities in 1981, particularly in Liverpool and London, when an endemically unprivileged young black urban population turned its sense of alienation from much of British society against the police. Since the Notting Hill race riots of 1958 in London, the integration of the immigrant West Indian community into British society had been a major problem. This problem worsened with the arrival, beginning in the 1960s, of South Asian immigrants from East Africa and the Indian subcontinent, who, like the Caribbean population, were highly concentrated in particular areas of the country and of cities.

                    This was evident earlier in the very limited nature of the Race Relations Act of 1965, itself fiercely opposed by the Conservatives. A subsequent amendment, in 1968, outlawed discrimination in areas such as employment and the provision of goods and services. However, it was not until the Race Relations Act of 1976 that any real change was evident. This act made both direct and indirect discrimination an offense and provided legal redress for those discriminated against through employment tribunals and the courts. Yet another amendment to the act, in 2001, included public bodies, particularly local authorities and the police, whose role in black communities continued to be a considerable source of tension. This unease was compounded by endemic inequality and deprivation in ethnic (especially Asian) communities. In 2001 the result was a wave of public disturbances across the north of England, in which disaffected youth once again played a leading role.

The Troubles also took the form of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, polarizing the Protestant and Catholic communities, each of which had its own paramilitary organizations.

Thatcher’s electoral success came from her extraordinary capacity for leadership and the development of ‘‘Thatcherism.” Responding to widespread disillusionment with Labour government and the state, Thatcher was able to tap into, and give leadership to, a politics of freedom and choice that expressed the desires of many people in the 1980s. In the wake of the debacle that the 1970s had been for the political left and trade union movement, Thatcherism’s variant of contemporary free-market neoliberalism gained increasing momentum. It effectively ended the postwar accommodation sometimes referred to as the corporate state, through which government, the unions, and business enabled a form of state-managed capitalism to develop. In its movement away from that accord, Britain foreshadowed developments in central and eastern Europe after the demise of communism there in 1989.</p>

She alienated even fellow Conservatives with her insistence on replacing local property taxes with a uniform poll tax and with her unwillingness to fully integrate the pound into a common European currency. By the end of 1989, voter discontent was manifest in by-elections, and in November 1990 Thatcher faced serious opposition for the first time in the Conservative party’s annual vote for selection of a leader. When she did not receive the required majority, she withdrew, and <xref refid="1828258"

                  <p>Despite having presided over the country’s longest recession since the 1930s and owing partly to the Labour Party’s overconfidence, the Conservatives won their fourth consecutive election in April 1992, albeit with a diminished majority of 21 in Parliament. That they did so was largely a result of the ongoing conflict within Labour as it continued to undergo ‘‘modernization.’’ As the recession lingered, the popularity of Major—and of the Conservatives—plummeted, and the party fared poorly in by-elections and in local elections. Major’s economic policies were questioned after the ‘‘Black Wednesday’’ fiasco of September 16, 1992, when he was forced to withdraw Britain from the European exchange-rate mechanism and devalue the pound. Despite having pledged not to increase taxes during the 1992 campaign, Major supported a series of increases to restore Britain’s financial equilibrium. When he sought to secure passage of the Treaty on European Union in 1993, his grip on power was challenged. Twenty-three Conservatives voted against a government resolution on the treaty, causing the government’s defeat and compelling Major to call a vote of confidence to pass the treaty. Tory troubles mounted with scandals in local governments, particularly in Westminster in 1994, and thereafter Major was seemingly unable to shake off the growing reputation of his government not only for economic mismanagement but also for corruption and moral hypocrisy. A seemingly unending series of financial and sexual scandals took their toll, and paper offensives like Major’s “Citizens Charter,” attempting to stop the growing rot of concern about the efficiency and responsibility of privatized industry by laying down citizens’ rights, made little impact.</p>

                    As criticism of his leadership mounted within the Conservative Party, Major resigned as party leader in June 1995. In the ensuing leadership election, Major solidified his position—though 89 Conservative members of Parliament voted for his opponent and 22 others abstained or spoiled their ballots. Major’s government was also severely criticized for its handling of the crisis involving ‘‘mad cow disease,’’ in which it was discovered that large numbers of cattle in the human food supply in Britain were infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

                  </p>
                  <p>The understanding that the party would have to rethink the market (not only in economic but in social terms), embracing it in a way foreign to many of the unions and the traditional Labour left, grew increasingly after 1992, until, after the Labour victory of 1997, there was a clearly marked path for New Labour. The most symbolically important marker of the change from Old to New Labour was the repeal of the party’s Clause IV, engineered by Blair in 1995. The replacement of old Clause IV, which had committed the party to the ‘‘common ownership of the means of production,’’ ended almost 80 years of dedication to that goal. The new path of the party was to be a middle one, in the phraseology of New Labour, a “third way,’’ supposedly embracing both social justice and the market. Not only in rhetoric but in reality, “new” Labour was to be different from “old.” There was also to be increasing attention to the importance of the media, an attention that the Tories had developed into something of a fine art under Thatcher, with her press secretary Bernard Ingham. Given the increasing role of the media in the presentation of politics and indeed the almost wholesale integration of political substance and political style through the media, this mastery of the art of “spin” was to become a political necessity. Therefore, art for art’s sake (spin for spin’s sake) was to become a feature of Labour government after 1997. This approach was ultimately to rebound upon the party and, indeed, upon the political process in general during the next decade with the emergence of widespread disillusionment with politics in British society, especially among young people.</p>

                    Labour’s landslide victory in 1997, which undoubtedly benefited from the inspirational leadership Blair seemed to offer, nevertheless may have been less the result of an unbounded belief in New Labour than of the discrediting of the Conservative Party. It is certain that Blair was helped into power by the parlous state into which the Conservative Party had fallen under Major after 1992. Promising that “we ran for office as New Labour, and we shall govern as New Labour,’’ the Blair government in fact began in a rather conservative fashion, by accepting existing government spending limitations. Nonetheless, the difficult and what came to be the increasingly troubled task of combining aspects of Thatcherism with the idea of a ‘‘social market” gathered momentum. Certainly, through much of Blair’s tenure a buoyant economy, well managed by Chancellor of the Exchequer <xref refid="1859211"

                  </p>
                  <p>Blair’s government was also more and more taken up with the question of whether Britain should stay in or remain outside the European monetary union. At stake were fundamental ideas about British sovereignty and whether, in a progressively globalized world in which some claimed that the individual nation-state was becoming unviable, sovereignty in its existing forms could remain intact. For the Conservative Party, ever more hostile to the European Union, this question was central to its attempts to fight back against the Labour Party. Blair’s government did sign the Treaty on European Union’s Social Chapter—which sought to harmonize European social policies on issues such as working conditions, equality in the workplace, and worker health and safety—despite Major’s earlier negotiation of an ‘‘opt out’’ mechanism to placate the treaty’s Conservative opponents. However, the Labour Party’s implementation of the Social Chapter was at best halfhearted, and its goal became to influence as much as possible the European Union itself to moderate the operations of the chapter. As with financial deregulation, the emphasis in labour affairs was on the market.</p>

Notwithstanding widespread and enormous public protests against war, the resignation of several government ministers, and the support of some one-third of the parliamentary Labour Party for a motion opposing the government’s policy, Blair remained steadfast in his conviction that Ṣaddām was an imminent threat that had to be removed. Following Ṣaddām’s ouster, however, British and American intelligence was found to have been faulty. When no WMD were found, critics of the government charged that it had distorted (‘‘sexed up’’) intelligence to solidify its claims against the Iraqis. Nevertheless, in May 2005 Blair won another term as prime minister—albeit with a significantly reduced parliamentary majority—as Labour won its third consecutive general election for the first time in the party’s history. The fallout from the Iraq War—initially the controversy over the decision to go to war in the first place and then the protracted involvement in a conflict that began to look more and more like a civil war—sapped public and political support for Blair.

Clegg’s outstanding performance in the first debate resulted in a surge in the preelection polls for the Liberal Democrats—who passed Labour to challenge the Conservative lead and to create both unprecedentedly high expectations for the Liberal Democrats and doubt as to whether any party would be able to secure enough seats to form a majority government. In the event, the Liberal Democrats actually obtained fewer seats in 2010 than in the 2005 election. The Conservatives finished as the largest party, winning 306 seats, but they finished 20 seats shy of a majority. The resulting “hung parliament” ironically placed the Liberal Democrats as potentially holding the balance of power. Labour finished with 258 seats, a fall of 91 seats over the 2005 election. When negotiations to form a Liberal Democratic–Labour coalition failed, the Liberal Democrats joined the Conservatives in a coalition government led by Cameron, who became prime minister on May 11, and Clegg, who became deputy prime minister.

The riots spread not only to other areas of Greater London but also to other British cities including Liverpool, Birmingham, and Bristol. Largely as a result of the increased deployment of police, however, the riots abated quickly. In the ensuing months, legal authorities used video footage of the events to arrest looters.

His actions strained the Conservatives’ coalition partnership with the Liberal Democrats and were criticized by Deputy Prime Minister Clegg, who called them “bad for Britain,” as well by French President Sarkozy, who said there were now two Europes—one that wanted “more solidarity between its members and more regulation” and another that was “attached only to the logic of the single market.”

Attempts to organize the market continued up to the beginning of World War II, evident, for example, in government’s financial support for regional development in the late 1930s. Few Britons, however, felt they were living in a period of decreased government power. Nonetheless, attachment to the “impartial state” and to voluntarism was still considerable and exemplified by the popularity of the approved organizations set up to administer health insurance in the interwar years. The governance of society through what were now taken to be the social characteristics of that society itself, for example, family life as well as demographic and economic factors—developed by Liberal administrations before World War I—along with the advent of “planning,” continued to be the direction of change, but the connection back to Victorian notions of moral individualism and the purely regulative, liberal state was still strong.

                  </thumbasm>There was, however, only an incremental increase in the level of interest in state involvement in the economy and society in the immediate years before World War II, when the fear of war galvanized politicians and administrators. It was the “total war” of 1939–45 that brought a degree of centralized control of the economy and society that was unparalleled before or indeed since. In some ways this was an expression of prewar developments, but the impetus of the war was enormous and felt in all political quarters. In 1941 it was a Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, who introduced the first Keynesian budget. Cross-party support was also evident in the response to the 1942 Beveridge Report, which became the blueprint of what was later to be called the welfare state. After 1945 a decisive shift had taken place toward the recognition of state intervention and planning as the norm, not the exception, and toward the idea that society could now be molded by political will. Nonetheless, there was much popular dislike of “government controls,” and the familiar rhetoric of the impartial state remained strong, as reflected in Beveridge’s attack in 1948 on the Labour government’s failure to encourage voluntarism. This voluntarism, however, was decidedly different from 19th-century voluntarism in that Beveridge advocated a minister-guardian of voluntary action. So pervasive was the postwar party consensus on the welfare state that the term coined to identify it, “Butskellism,” is at least as well remembered as the successive chancellors of the Exchequer—<xref refid="1808489"

                  From the 1960s onward this consensus began to unravel, with the perception of poor economic performance and calls for the modernization of British society and the British economy.

In the 1970s in particular, older beliefs in constitutional methods came into question—for instance, in the first national Civil Service strike ever, in 1973, and in the strikes and political violence that marked that decade as a whole. The result was a revolution in the relationship between state and society, whereby the market came to replace society as the model of state governance. This did not, however, mean a return to 19th-century models, though the character of this manifestation of the relationship between state and society was clearly liberal, in line with the long British tradition of governance.
                </p>
                <p>Institutionally, this way of governing was pluralistic, but its pluralism was decidedly statist. It was not, as in the 19th century, a private, self-governing voluntarist pluralism but one that was designedly competitive, enlisting quasi-governmental institutions as clients competing with one another in a marketplace. In economic and cultural conditions increasingly shaped by globalization, the economy was exposed to the benign operations of the market not by leaving it alone but by actively intervening in it to create the conditions for entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>Analogously, social life was marketized too, thrown open to the idea that the capacity for self-realization could be obtained only through individual activity, not through society. Institutions like the NHS were reformed as a series of internal markets. These markets were to be governed by what has been called “the new public management.” This involved a focus upon accountability, with explicit standards and measures of performance. The ethical change involved a transition from the idea of public service to one of private management of the self. Parallel to this “culture of accountability” was the emergence of an “audit society,” in which formal and professionally sanctioned monitoring systems replaced the trust that earlier versions of relationship between state and society had invested in professional specialists of all sorts (the professions themselves, such as university teaching, were opened up to this sort of audit, which was all the more onerous because, if directed from above, it was carried out by the professionals themselves, so preserving the fiction of professional freedom).</p>
                <p>The social state gave way to a state that was regarded as “enabling,” permitting not only the citizen but also the firm, the locality, and so on to freely choose. This politics of choice was in fact shared by the Thatcher’s Conservative administration and Blair’s Labour one. In both the state was seen as a partner. In the so-called “Third Way” of Blair, one between socialism and the market, the partnership evolved much more in terms of community than in the Conservative case. In Blair’s Labour vision there was a more active concern with creating ethical citizens who would exchange obligations for rights in a new realization of marketized communities. This new relation of state and society involved the decentralization of rule upon the citizen himself and herself, which was reflected in the host of self-help activities to be found in the Britain of the 1990s and 2000s, from the new concern with alternative health therapies to the self-management of schools. Reflecting this decentralization (in which the state itself made the citizen a consumer, for instance, of education and health) was the increasingly important role of the consumption of goods in constructing lifestyles through which individual choice could realize self-expression and self-fulfilment.</p>

                <p>Economically, Britain had been hurt severely by World War I. The huge balances of credit in foreign currencies that had provided the capital for the City of London’s financial operations for a century were spent. Britain had moved from the position of a creditor to that of a debtor country. Moreover, its industrial infrastructure, already out of date at the start of the war, had been allowed to depreciate and decay further. The industries of the Industrial Revolution, such as coal mining, textile production, and shipbuilding, upon which British prosperity had been built, were now either weakened or redundant. The Japanese had usurped the textile export market. Coal was superseded by other forms of energy. Shipping lost during the war had to be almost fully replaced with more-modern and more-efficient vessels.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Treaty of Versailles, particularly its harsh demands on Germany for financial reparations, ensured that foreign markets would remain depressed. Germany had been Britain’s largest foreign customer. The export of German coal to France, as stipulated by the treaty, upset world coal markets for nearly a decade. Depression and unemployment, not prosperity and a better Britain, characterized the interwar years.</p>

By the end of 1930, unemployment was nearly double the figure of 1928 and would reach 25 percent of the workforce by the spring of 1931. It was accompanied, after the closing of banks in Germany in May, by a devastating run on gold in British banks that threatened the stability of the pound.
                </p>
                <p>MacDonald’s government fell in August over the protection of the pound; Britain needed to borrow gold, but foreign bankers would lend gold only on the condition that domestic expenditures would be cut, and this meant, among other things, reducing unemployment insurance payments. However, a Labour Party whose central commitment was to the welfare of the working people could not mandate such a course of action even in an economic crisis. Thus, the Labour cabinet resigned. MacDonald with a few colleagues formed a coalition with the Conservative and Liberal opposition on August 24, 1931. This new “national” government, which allowed Britain to go off the gold standard on September 21, was confirmed in office by a general election on October 27, in which 473 Conservatives were returned while the Labour Party in the House of Commons was nearly destroyed, capturing only 52 seats. MacDonald, who was returned to the House of Commons along with 13 so-called National Labour colleagues, remained prime minister nonetheless. The new government was in fact a conservative government, and MacDonald, by consenting to remain prime minister, became and remains in Labour histories a traitor.</p>

Housing subsidies were cut; Britain ended its three-quarter-century devotion to free trade and began import protection; and interest rates were lowered. Manufacturing revived, stimulated particularly by a marked revival in the construction of private housing made possible by reduced interest rates and by a modest growth in exports as a result of the cheaper pound. Similarly, unemployment declined, although it never reached the 10 percent level of the late 1920s until after the outbreak of war.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of the occupational structure of Britain, the aftermath of World War I saw the decline of the great 19th-century staple industries become increasingly sharp, and the interwar experience of textiles was particularly difficult. The great expansion of mining after 1881 became a contraction, particularly from the 1930s, and domestic service, which itself may be termed a staple industry, suffered similarly. In 1911 these sectors accounted for some 20 percent of the British labour force, but by 1961 they accounted for barely 5 percent. Manufacturing continued to be of great importance into the third quarter of the century, when the next great restructuring occurred. After World War I an increasing emphasis on monopoly, scale, and sophisticated labour-management became apparent in British industry, though there was still much of the old “archaicism” of the 19th century to be seen, both in respect to management practices and the entrenched power of certain skilled occupations. Although different from its 19th-century antecedents, a distinct sense of working-class identity, based on manual work—especially in the manufacturing industry and mining—remained strong until about 1960. This was buttressed by a considerable degree of continuity in terms of residential community. After 1960 or so, the wholesale development of slum clearance and relocation to new residential settings was to go far to dissolve this older sense of identity.</p>
                <p>From the interwar years automobile manufacture, the manufacture of consumer durables, and light industry, especially along the corridor between London and Birmingham, as well as in the new industrial suburbs of London, announced the economic eclipse of the north by the south, the “south” here including South Wales and industrial Scotland. In the Midlands electrical manufacturing and automobile industries developed. In the south, in addition to construction industries, new service industries such as hotels and the shops of London flourished. These in particular offered employment opportunities for women at a time when the demand for domestic servants was in decline. London grew enormously, and the unemployment rate there was half that of the north of England and of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The effect of these developments was to divide Britain politically and economically into two areas, a division that, with the exception of an interval during World War II and its immediate aftermath, still exists. New, science-based industries (e.g., the electrical and chemical industries) also developed from the interwar period, which together with the multiplication of service industries and the growth of the public sector—despite repeated government attempts to halt this growth—had by 1960 given rise to an occupational structure very different from that of the 19th century.</p>
                <p>On the surface the 1950s and early ’60s were years of economic expansion and prosperity. The economic well-being of the average Briton rose dramatically and visibly. But when prosperity created a demand for imports, large-scale buying abroad hurt the value of the pound. A declining pound meant higher interest rates as well as credit and import controls, which in turn caused inflation. Inflation hurt exports and caused strikes. These crises occurred in approximately three-year cycles.</p>
                <p>The economic concern then of the British government in the 1950s and ’60s and indeed through the 1970s was to increase productivity and ensure labour peace so that Britain could again become an exporting country able to pay for public expenditure at home while maintaining the value of its currency and its place as a world banker. A drastic run on the pound had been one of the pressing reasons for the quick withdrawal from Suez in 1956, and throughout the 1950s and ’60s Britain’s share of world trade fell with almost perfect consistency by about 1 percent per year. On the other hand, Britain benefited from an unprecedented rise in tourism occasioned mostly by the attraction of “Swinging London.”</p>

                  In the aftermath of increasing difficulties for industry and increasing labour conflict, the Thatcher governments after 1979 set about a far-reaching restructuring of the economy, one based less on economic than on political and moral factors. Thatcher set out to end socialism in Britain. Her most dramatic acts consisted of a continuing series of statutes to denationalize nearly every industry that Labour had brought under government control in the previous 40 years as well as some industries, such as telecommunications, that had been in state hands for a century or more. But perhaps her most important achievement, helped by high unemployment in the old heavy industries, was in winning the contest for power with the trade unions. Instead of attempting to put all legislation in one massive bill, as Heath had done, Thatcher proceeded step by step, making secondary strikes and boycotts illegal, providing for fines, as well as allocation of union funds, for the violation of law, and taking measures for ending the closed shop. Finally, in 1984–85, she won a struggle with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), who staged a nationwide strike to prevent the closure of 20 coal mines that the government claimed were unproductive. The walkout, which lasted nearly a year and was accompanied by continuing violence, soon became emblematic of the struggle for power between the Conservative government and the trade unions. After the defeat of the miners, that struggle was essentially over; Thatcher’s victory was aided by divisions within the ranks of the miners themselves, exacerbated by the divisive leadership of the militant NUM leader Arthur Scargill, and by the Conservative government’s use of the police as a national constabulary, one not afraid to employ violence. The miners returned to work without a single concession. In all these efforts, Thatcher was helped by a revival of world prosperity and lessening inflation, by the profits from industries sold to investors, and by the enormous sums realized from the sale abroad of North Sea <xref refid="0"

From 1974 the unexpected windfall of the discovery of large oil reserves under the North Sea, together with the increase in oil prices that year, transformed Britain into a considerable player in the field of oil production (production soared from 87,000 tons in 1974 to 75,000,000 tons five years later). The political use of oil revenues was seen by some as characteristic of the failure of successive British governments to put them to good economic and social use.
                </p>
                <p>The restructuring of the economy away from the manual and industrial sectors, which was a consequence of the rapid decline of manufacturing industry in Britain in the 1990s, also meant the decline of the old, manual working class and the coming of what has been called “postindustrial” or “postmodern” society. Within industry itself, “post-Fordist” (flexible, technologically innovative, and demand-driven) production and new forms of industrial management restructured the labour force in ways that broke up traditional hierarchies and outlooks. Not least among these changes has been the expansion of work, chiefly part-time, for women. There has been a corresponding rise of new, nonmanual employment, primarily in the service sector. In the early phases of these changes, there was much underemployment and unemployment.</p>
                <p>The result has been not only the numerical decline of the old working class but the diminishing significance of manual work itself, as well as the growing disappearance of work as a fairly stable, uniform, lifelong experience. The shift in employment and investment from production to consumption industries has paralleled the rise of consumption itself as an arena in which people’s desires and hopes are centred and as the basis of their conceptions of themselves and the social order. However, in the 1990s there was a considerable move back to the workplace as the source of identity and self-value. At the same time, new management practices and ideas developed that were in line with the still generally high level of working hours.</p>
                <p>Central to the new economy and new ideas about work has been the staggering growth of information technology. This has been especially evident in the operations of financial markets, contributing hugely to their global integration. One of the great beneficiaries of these changes has been the City of London, which has profited from very light state regulation. The financial sector, in terms of international markets and the domestic provision of financial goods and services, has become a major sector of the new economy. Speculation in markets, with ever-increasing degrees of ingenuity (for example, the phenomenon of hedge fund trading), has helped create a cohort of the newly rich in Britain and elsewhere. It has also led to an increasingly unstable world financial system. The spoils of this new society have been divided between large-scale multinational corporations and new kinds of industrial organizations that are smaller and often more responsive to demand, evident in development of the dot.com and e-commerce phenomena. Internet shopping, along with the unparalleled development of giant supermarket chains, transformed the traditional pattern of retailing and shopping and, with it, patterns of social interaction. This, however, was only one aspect of a general transformation of the economy and society that even as recently as the early 1990s had hardly been glimpsed.</p>
                <p>In the conditions of economic stability and prosperity at the turn of the 21st century, a relatively large middle group arose in terms of income, housing, and lifestyle that politicians and others began to refer to as ‘‘middle England.’’ In effect this meant Scotland and Wales as well, although in Britain as a whole the old imbalance between west and east continued, in a similar fashion to that between north and south in England. However, even this middle was exposed to the vagaries of financial markets and an underperforming welfare state. Moreover, the gap between the least well-off and the most well-off widened even further, so that alongside the new rich were the new poor, or underclass. Social mobility either declined or stalled in comparison with the 1960s—in particular, the capacity of the poorest parents to send their children to university. Levels of poverty among children continued to be high. The reborn postindustrial cities of the north and Midlands, such as Manchester, came to symbolize much of the new Britain, with their mixture of revitalized city centres and deprived city perimeters that were home to the new poor. However, as had long been the case, the economic centre of the country remained in London and the southeast. Britain thus became a prosperous but increasingly unequal and divided society.</p>

The birth rate continued to fall through the interwar years, and in the 1920s the two-child pattern of marriage was becoming established. With it came the “nuclear family” structure that was to be characteristic of much of the 20th century, with households predominantly made up of two parents with children who on achieving adulthood will leave the home to establish similar families themselves. Nonetheless, as always, there was considerable variation in practice. Coresident kin and lodgers were still found, particularly in working-class households, where overcrowding was often marked, as it was in London after the disruptions of World War II. There was also a concentration on childbirth within the early years of marriage, as well as longer life expectancy for children themselves.
                </p>
                <p>Marriage was thus becoming a different kind of institution, at once more intimate and private, as well as an arena in which individual self-expression was becoming more possible than previously. In many respects, the privacy that was possible for the better-off in society in the mid- and late 19th century became increasingly possible for those less well-off in the course of the 20th century. However, the privacy that new kinds of family life and new economic possibilities made possible for poorer people differed from middle-class privacy. It was concerned with securing order and control of people’s lives in economic conditions that were still often difficult. As a result, “working-class respectability” differed from the respectability evident further up the social scale. For instance, privacy was evident in the slowly increasing possibility of separate rooms for separate functions (kitchens, sculleries, and bathrooms, for example) and the development of more-private sleeping arrangements. However, the respectability of this private life was also public in that it was on show to neighbours as a living proof of the family’s capacity to create order in difficult lives: the elaborately presented front of the house and the purposefully opened curtains of the “best room” of the home displayed the carefully presented if precarious affluence of the family.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, despite material and cultural class differences, there was a convergence across the social spectrum upon an increasingly common privatized and nucleated family life. This was part of a much more homogeneous life course and set of life experiences, which made the population increasingly uniform, at least compared with that of the 19th century. Age at marriage, the experience of marriage itself and of running one’s own household, household size, and the similarity of the age at which major life-cycle transitions occurred all tended to produce more cultural uniformity than previously; this increasing uniformity was of vast importance for the new consumer and media industries, not to mention the political parties. The political culture was in fact transformed from one based on class to a new sort of populist, demotic politics, shaped at least as much by the mass media, especially the popular press, as by the politicians.</p>

                  The greater individualism possible within this more-privatized form of marriage received expression in the growing incidence of <xref refid="0"

                        tocid="">divorce</xref>, even as marriage itself grew greatly in importance in the 20th century. By the 1970s almost every adult female married at least once, though this figure fell considerably beginning in the 1980s. By 1997 one-third of births occurred to parents not formally married; however, more than half of these were to parents residing at the same address. The phenomena of one-parent families, as well as of stable unmarried cohabitation, now became widely apparent. If people married more often, they divorced more frequently too, so that by the 1980s marriage disruption rates by divorce were equal to those caused by death in the 19th century. By this time approximately one out of three marriages ended in divorce. These changes were of profound significance for politics in that they became linked in the public and political mind to the phenomena of antisocial behaviour by youth. Although this link was in reality complex, it did not stop the Blair administration from pursuing a “respect” agenda, which was designed to restore an at least partly imagined former era of civic virtue and public order. The ill-fated ASBO (Anti-Social Behaviour Order), restricting the movement of offenders, was celebrated by some as an appropriately strong response to troublemaking neighbours and gangs but was condemned by others as an attack on civil liberties.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, these social changes also greatly affected the understanding of women’s role in society. They were complemented by the growth of women’s employment, particularly in part-time jobs and most notably in the service sector, so that after 1945 a different life cycle for women evolved that included the return to work after childbirth. These changes did not result in the equality of earnings, however; for example, despite the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, under which the Equal Opportunities Commission was established, women’s pay rates in the 1980s were only about two-thirds of those of men. Still, higher education was increasingly opened to women from the 1960s, so that by 1980 they formed 40 percent of admissions to universities, although, as with male students, they were overwhelmingly from the higher social classes. As part of the widespread movement toward greater liberalization in the 1960s, in part inspired by developments in the United States, women’s liberation also developed in Britain.</p>

Intellectual life became increasingly characterized by an explicitly feminist analysis, which led to some fundamental rethinking in a whole range of academic disciplines, though resistance to this was strong. Changes in patterns of employment challenged stereotyped distinctions between the breadwinner and the housewife, as well as stereotypical notions of life as a married couple being based upon a well-understood division of labour within the household. The phenomena of the ‘‘new man’’ developed, though his progeny of the 1990s, the ‘‘new lad,’’ was not quite what his father had expected. Coined to describe what was in fact a reinvented, consumer-led version of a long-held and ingrained masculine worldview, ‘‘laddism’’ turned out to be a snazzier, more fashion-driven, and above all more unashamed version of the old devotion to ‘‘birds’’ (women), beer, and football (soccer).

By 1914 there were 4,000 cinemas in Britain and about 400,000,000 admissions per year. By 1934 this had more than doubled, and admissions continued to rise steadily to reach a peak of 1.6 billion in 1946. This was a particularly popular form of entertainment, especially among the working class: the lower down the social scale one was, the more likely one was to visit the cinema. The suburban middle-class motion picture audience of the 1930s was important but remained a minority. It is difficult to exaggerate the dominance of the cinema as a form of entertainment. In 1950, out of over 1,500,000 admissions to forms of taxable entertainment (and this included horse racing and football matches), cinema made up more than 80 percent. Hollywood films dominated, though until World War II there was a thriving British film industry. This domination continued after the war, although British cinema asserted itself powerfully from time to time; for instance, in the Social Realism of the 1960s, notably in the work of director <xref refid="1828540"

This did much to create cultural uniformity, although, as with motion pictures, there were considerable differences of taste and preference regarding newspapers. However, after 1950 the emphasis on uniformity became more marked and was reinforced by the progressive concentration of ownership in the hands of a few proprietors. This circle of ownership became even smaller as time went on, so that at the beginning of the 21st century the empire of the most powerful of these media moguls, <xref refid="1828541"

Newspapers, however, were but one component of Murdoch’s and similar empires. The revolution wrought by new information technologies put control of a wide variety of communication forms, most importantly television, in the hands of these powerful individuals. Their political influence swelled as politicians of all persuasions were compelled to accommodate their power and, in a form of spin, play their version of the political game.

                <p>The development of a national mass culture seen in the previous period, in which the distinction between “popular” and “high” culture, if still important, was to some extent bridged, was to continue into the 20th and 21st centuries. (Cultural homogeneity was also intensified by increasing social and lifestyle uniformity.) To a considerable extent, from the 1960s, all culture became popular culture, so that differences of gender, class, and ethnicity became if not merged then renegotiated in terms of a mass, “shared” culture. In this process, the older class differences were eroded, in line with other changes in class structure, particularly in the manual working class. At the same time, new differences and solidarities also emerged, particularly around age and levels of consumption.</p>

The development of a uniform popular culture, at least as expressed through popular music, was greatly beholden to similar developments in the United States, where social identities were explored and developed in terms of black popular music, not just by African Americans but also by young white Americans. Given the great importance of Afro-Caribbean immigration into Britain after 1945, and latterly south Asian immigration, the experience of ethnic minorities in Britain to some degree also paralleled that of the United States. Concerns about national identity, as well as personal and group identity, became more important as Britain became a multicultural society and as the growth of European integration and economic globalization increasingly called British—and English, Welsh, and Scottish—identity into question.
                </p>
                <p>The liberalization of the 1960s appears to have been crucial for many of these changes, with shifting gender roles being only one part of a broader international agenda. The civil rights movement in Ireland, student protest, and the anti-Vietnam War and civil rights movements in the United States were all part of the assault on the still-strong vestiges of Victorianism in British society, as well as, more immediately, a reaction against the austerity of postwar Britain. Change in family life and sexual mores was represented in the 1960s by a range of legislative developments: the Abortion Act of 1967; the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, partially decriminalizing homosexual activity; the 1969 Divorce Reform Act; and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. (Moreover, debate concerning sexual mores continued in Britain throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, not least regarding the ongoing attempts to change the legal age of consent and the controversial Section 28 Amendment to the Local Government Act in 1988, which prohibited local authorities from promoting homosexuality.)</p>
                <p>
                  Change was also based on the relative economic affluence of the late 1950s and ’60s. The disintegration of older values (including middle class values) was evident in the “rediscovery” of the working class, in which films, novels, plays, and academic works depicted working-class life with unparalleled realism and unparalleled sympathy (including the works of the <xref refid="1809127"

                        tocid="">Angry Young Men</xref>). The working class was therefore brought into the cultural mainstream. This was ironic at a time when working-class communities were in fact being broken apart by slum clearance and the relocation of populations away from the geographical locations of their traditional culture.
                </p>
                <p>Changes in higher education, with the development of the polytechnics and the “new universities,” meant that, at least to some extent, higher education was thrown open to children from poorer homes. There was also the liberalization of educational methods in primary and secondary education, along with the emergence of comprehensive schooling, ending the old distinction between the secondary modern and the grammar schools. In practice, many of the old divisions continued and, indeed, increased. However, rather than being accompanied by increasing cultural divisions, the opposite was the case. There was a much more positive understanding of the “popular” than before. A more fluid, open, and commercial popular culture was signalled by the development in the 1950s of commercial television and, with it, the slow decline of the public broadcasting, public service ethic of the BBC. With the explosion of new channels of communication in the 2000s, particularly in television, there was a noted ‘‘dumbing down’’ of all media, which was especially evident in the celebrity culture of the new century and not unique to the United Kingdom. The new television gorged on this, as well as on reality programming and on the enormously increased popularity of professional football. These brought all classes together in a new demotic culture, although at the same time differentiation according to income, taste, and education became increasingly possible because of the technologies of the new media.</p>
                <p>
                  The various lifestyles associated with different genres of popular music are one telling indication of the way that lifestyle can determine an individual’s identity in modern society. This development reflects the withdrawal of the state from the direct intervention in social life that was so characteristic of the third quarter of the 20th century. The state’s turn to the market as a model of government has been reproduced in terms of the market’s direct role in the formation of cultural life, so that the relationship between public culture and consumer capitalism has been close, in many ways the one constantly trying to outguess the other. This game of one-upmanship, marked by ironic knowingness, has been labelled “postmodern.” However, this term has come to describe much of late 20th- and early 21st-century international culture and society, not only in Britain. It points to the growing understanding of the relative nature of truth, itself a reaction against the prevailing supposedly “modern” certainties of the 20th century (reason, freedom, humanity, and truth itself), which indeed have often had an appalling outcome. However, it was a sign of the times that these antifundamentalist currents, themselves critical of much of Western culture, emerged at much the same time as new fundamentalisms emerged in the forms of American neoconservatism and certain strains of radical <xref refid="0"

                          *The origin of the term <i>prime minister</i> and the question to whom it should originally be applied have long been issues of scholarly and political debate. Although the term was used as early as the reign of Queen Anne (1702–14), it acquired wider currency during the reign of George II (1727–60), when it began to be used as a term of reproach toward Sir Robert Walpole. The title of prime minister did not become official until 1905, to refer to the leader of a government.<br/> **Before the development of the Conservative and Liberal parties in the mid-19th century, parties in Britain were largely simply alliances of prominent groups or aristocratic families. The designations Whig and Tory tend often to be approximate. In all cases, the party designation is that of the prime minister; he might lead a coalition government, as did David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill (in his first term).
